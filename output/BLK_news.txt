Title: While client climate commitments waver, some media agencies are doubling down

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it. Last spring after working with activist Monica Lewinsky on its “You’ve Got the Power” campaign, which featured Lewinsky, encouraged voter registration and ultimately became a viral hit, was an inflection point for the brand. While advertisers increase spending in Amazon DSP, the platform still has a long way to go. Publicis on Tuesday said it plans to acquire Brazil-based influencer marketing company BR Media Group, which has access to a network of some 500,000 creators – 80% of whom are the region’s largest influencers, according to the company. Pending regulatory approval, the deal is expected to close in late March 2025. Financial terms were not made available.

Title: MFC Asset promotes initial Ethereum ETF

MFC Asset Management is launching Thailand's first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in the world's second-largest cryptocurrency amid the boom in the asset class, rallied in part by US President Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies. Thanachot Rungsitthiwat, managing director of MFC, said the company is launching the MFC Ethereum ETF Tracker Fund (METHETF-UI), which is restricted to institutional and ultra-accredited investors (UI). The fund focuses on investing in Ethereum. The company introduced MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (MBTCETF-UI) in 2024, which allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, with the fund size topping 10 billion baht. Given that success, MFC decided to introduce the Ethereum ETF to match the growing interest in digital assets. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, is a programmable blockchain that enables users to deploy smart contracts, which automatically enforce agreements without requiring intermediaries or disclosing the identities of the contracting parties. Popular innovations built on Ethereum include stablecoins, such as USDC pegged to the dollar, decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and GameFi, which is a combination of gaming and decentralised finance. Ethereum is the name of the network, while Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency used in the network to pay transaction fees on the platform. Mr Thanachot said the METHETF-UI fund invests in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF as the master fund in dollars. The master fund is structured as a trust under Delaware state law and is listed on the Nasdaq. The fund is sponsored by iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor Llc and managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors. The master fund aims to reflect the price of Ether before fees and expenses by directly trading Ether on a peer-to-peer basis or through digital asset investment platforms. He said the highlight of METHETF-UI is it allows investors to access Ethereum investments through the stock market by investing in a master fund that focuses on direct investment. The fund is one of the largest Ethereum ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with a net asset value of US$3.6 billion, and it reports high liquidity. METHETF-UI is classified as a high-risk or complex mutual fund with a risk level 8+. The fund is offered exclusively to institutional and wealthy investors. The initial public offering is open until Feb 27, with a minimum investment of 1,000 baht.

Title: 4 Under-The-Radar Stock Picks For Q1 2025 From Top Managers

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 24: Stock market numbers are displayed at the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] during morning trading on January 24, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Value stocks have had a difficult time over the last few years, but things could be looking up, especially for investors who seek out lesser-known names. In recent interviews with me, Jim Zimmerman, Abigail Zimmerman, and Ara Laterovian with Lowell Capital, and Ted Rosenthal with TMR Capital each shared their two top under-the-radar stock picks. Lowell Capital chose Macfarlane Group and Academy Sports and Outdoors, while Rosenthal selected REV Group and Celestica. Macfarlane Group is the leading specialist distributor of protective packaging materials in the U.K. It operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, providing industrial and retail customers with a wide range of protective packaging materials. The Lowell Capital team was initially drawn to Macfarlane Group’s “highly cash-generative business model, ‘Ft. Knox’ balance sheet, sustainable and resilient business model, entrenched customer relationships, high ROIC business model, non-capital intensive business, disciplined management team, and long-term growth path.” The Lowell team highlighted Macfarlane’s resilient business model, reporting that it consistently passes along raw material pricing changes to customers. As a result, management focuses more on gross profits than top-line revenues. They believe it’s largely due to high switching costs among customers. Macfarlane Group has also gone through a successful turnaround and growth strategy under CEO Peter Atkinson. “We believe MACF can drive sales growth through accretive acquisitions alongside modest organic growth,” the Lowell team said. “We believe MACF’s highly cash-generative and high-ROIC business model can grow adjusted EBITDA from £36 million in 2023 to £45 million by 2027 with zero net debt and trade for 8x adjusted EBITDA for a market cap and enterprise value of £360 million.” They estimate that Macfarlane Group could be worth £2.25 per share, versus its current price of around £1.12 a share. Additionally, the Lowell Capital team believes the company could be an attractive M&A target. Academy and Sports Outdoors is a sporting and outdoor recreational retailer in the U.S., operating 282 stores across 18 states. The company is the second-largest sporting goods retailer in the country. The Lowell team was initially drawn to Academy and Sports Outdoors for its high cash generation, low cash flow multiple, strong balance sheet and strong growth prospects. They highlighted several characteristics that they like, including a highly resilient business model, a cash-generative business, and a strong focus on value-added services. The Lowell team also likes its attractive valuation at less than 5x adjusted EBITDA and high single-digit free cash flow yield, its record of strong sales and profit growth, its disciplined management plan and “Ft. Knox” balance sheet with net debt of about $100 million, its long-term strategy to grow sales to $10 billion and net income margin to 10% by 2028, and its high-ROIC business model with limited capital requirements. REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles like fire and emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, RVs, and related aftermarket parts and services. The company is the result of several bolt-on acquisitions between 2006 and 2020 and was founded by private equity firm American Industrial Partners. Rosenthal was initially drawn to REV Group as a short position because he suspected it might be overearning. However, he switched his thesis from short to long because record backlog growth quickly drove large price increases that haven’t yet appeared in the company’s financials. “As throughput and margins normalize in Specialty Vehicles, and as business rebounds in RVs (from depressed levels), EBITDA margins should expand to 11% by 2026,” Rosenthal explained. “Ten times normalized 2026 EBITDA results in 144% upside for a 49% IRR.” He added that REV Group enjoys a high and growing market share in an attractive oligopoly industry for its Specialty Vehicles segment, while Fire and Emergency demand tends to be stable because it’s driven by replacement cycles. Prices in F&E have risen 3% over the last few decades with no down years, and the industry has consolidated, leading to record-high backlogs and improved pricing power. “Business quality is also decent,” Rosenthal pointed out. “There is a lot of customization/ value add, variable cost structure, low maintenance capex, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital, and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs. Celestica is a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and outsourced manufacturer that manages global networks capable of delivering customized supply chain solutions. Rosenthal was initially drawn to the stock because he was seeking a value-oriented way to gain exposure to artificial intelligence. He feels Celestica is an underappreciated AI play, noting that it’s trading at around 20x P/E. He estimates 12x 2026 EBITDA for 83% upside and a 22% investment rate on return. “CLS has historically been a decent business but always traded at a low valuation multiple because of its low margins and difficulty in predicting the business’ financials,” Rosenthal explained. “EMS businesses operate in a competitive industry (more so with consumer electronics, where CLS has minimal exposure) with very thin operating margins, are subject to the performance of their end markets, and there is very little visibility beyond the next quarter.” Market breadth increased toward the end of 2024, giving many value stocks a boost versus their growth counterparts. However, according to BlackRock, many investors have had limited exposure to value because it’s just a small portion of the market indexes. As a result, it might take a bit of a deeper dive to gain access to this segment of the market, either through value indexes like the SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF or similar actively managed funds. However, investors who are prepared for value to make a comeback will be better positioned for when it happens, like during late 2024. It’s anyone’s guess whether value will continue to hold on in 2025, but so far, things are looking up. The SPDR Value ETF is holding its own against the growth-oriented S&P 500, with both up more than 3% year to date. At this point, it looks like we’re in a holding pattern between growth and value, making it a good time to hold exposures to both.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Some underappreciated cryptocurrencies might yield even higher rewards if Bitcoin gets closer to reaching a record high. Four small-cap coins with significant profit potential are identified in this article. Examine these undiscovered treasures that might hold the secret to riches before Bitcoin hits its next significant milestone. XYZVerse ($XYZ) has introduced a novel idea to the memecoin market by fusing the fast-paced adrenaline of cryptocurrency with the thrill of sports. Developed for ardent supporters of esport, basketball, MMA, and football, this initiative is more than just another token; it’s a thriving community centered around a shared love of the sport. XYZVerse’s ambitious Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision sets it apart from other meme coins. It recently won the title of Best New Meme Project, proving that people are paying attention. What makes $XYZ unique? It is not a passing fad. This project has a committed community that is focused on long-term growth and a clear roadmap. The $XYZ token, driven by the sports mentality, has become the front-runner, poised to overtake rivals and take Elon Musk’s journey to the moon. For people who are passionate about cryptocurrency and sports, $XYZ is headed to the winner’s podium to become a badge of distinction. Access to the token at a unique pre-listing price is possible through the ongoing $XYZ presale. Starting Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.002 Within a few months, $XYZ had already risen by more than 2000%! Stage Next: $0.0025 + 25 inbound jump Target for the last knockout: $0.1 From launch to token creation, $XYZ aims for an incredible 99,900% increase! You’re out if you’re not in. With the swiftness of a champion’s knockout shot, the $XYZ presale is already tearing through stages. Jupiter (JUP), one of the most well-known decentralized exchange aggregators, is upending the Solana ecosystem. To provide consumers with the best prices for their token swaps, it aggregates many liquidity pools. Jupiter makes sure you get the most out of your trades by aggregating multiple pools, preventing losses due to price variations among exchanges. Jupiter now offers more services than only coin exchanges. It now offers stablecoin management, perpetual futures, and a new launchpad called LFG that facilitates the beginning of new Solana projects. Jupiter’s potential is found in its capacity to address a prevalent issue in defi. It deals with price differences that can result in users losing money when they trade. It ensures higher rates by pooling liquidity. Jupiter is also taking a step toward decentralized governance with the January 31, 2024, introduction of its native coin, JUP. In exchange for rewards, holders can stake their JUP tokens to vote on crucial issues including ecosystem projects and liquidity plans. Jupiter distinguishes itself in the current market by improving the DeFi experience on Solana, where user control and efficiency are prized. Platforms with greater value and community involvement may draw users as the DeFi space develops. Ondo Finance is bridging the gap between the traditional and modern sectors. It combines the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology with the stability of tradfi by converting dependable, revenue-producing real-world assets into digital tokens. As a result, more people have access to previously unattainable high-quality solutions. The two main components of Ondo are the development of DeFi protocols and tokenized products. Combined, they improve Ondo’s products’ functionality and scalability and aid in the system’s modernization. By collaborating with reputable partners like BlackRock and utilizing Coinbase for safe asset storage, Ondo distinguishes itself in a sector where security and trust are essential. Their product, USDY, is backed by bank deposits and U.S. Treasuries and offers the convenience of a stablecoin along with additional interest. This makes regulated and transparent solutions available to users who are not based in the United States. Ondo stands apart from other coins due to its emphasis on compliance and real-world assets. Ondo’s combination of tradfi and innovation may make it a desirable option in the current market as blockchain technology advances and consumers search for more reliable and trustworthy solutions. A new blockchain platform called Sui is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community. It is made to be quick, safe, and suitable for usage anywhere in the world. Fundamentally, Sui makes use of Move, a secure programming language, and a special method of managing data. This aids in resolving issues that other blockchains frequently encounter. Sui’s emphasis on the user, however, is what makes it truly unique. It aims to make blockchain simple and available to anyone. With features like sponsored transactions and zkLogin, Sui is removing obstacles and improving the use of blockchain technology. Sui’s robust technology and emphasis on the user experience make it stand out in the current market. It places a higher priority on making blockchain accessible to everyone than some other currency. As more people search for user-friendly platforms, this could offer it an advantage. Although the market is always shifting, Sui’s creative strategy can make it a desirable choice. Sui may be establishing a new benchmark in the cryptocurrency space by fusing robust technology with an emphasis on simplicity. Although JUP, ONDO, and SUI have a lot of promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out for bringing meme culture and sports enthusiasts together.

Title: Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/18/2025 8:48:45 AM PST by MtnClimber Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows.

While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4.

President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin https://freerepublic.com/focus/news/4296693/posts?page=48#48 I was in a chain grocery Friday and noticed that a dozen GENERIC eggs was priced at $4.85...and each additional dozen was >$9.00. It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during Covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

It was enough to anger me beyond belief, renewed as I grabbed my eggs for breakfast this morning. I penned this email to a local radio station not long after. I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other labs. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

I did the deep dive a couple of weeks ago and found that feds/states are taking a “presumptive positive” case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka H5N1) in a chicken flock, drawing a 3km circle on a map and culling - “Preemptive depopulation” - ALL chickens in that circle... ...”depopulation” aka “Stamping out”... ...while simultaneously displaying on the website that “infected chicken meat & eggs are safe for human consumption” and crowing about “chicken vaccines,” telling workers to take “biosecurity measures” to stop a threat which comes from OVERHEAD (wild birds)...aka, “stop the spread.” “Preemptive depopulation of poultry on other premises in the Infected Zone (typically 3 kilometers around the index case, also known as the Infected Premises) may also be authorized.” “When properly prepared and cooked, HPAI does not affect meat or egg products, and these food items remain safe.” Worse, the CDC is still operating under the aegis of ‘climate change’ lunacy with their “One Health” approach: https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html “The earth has experienced changes in climate and land use, such as deforestation and intensive farming practices. Disruptions in environmental conditions and habitats can provide new opportunities for diseases to pass to animals.” https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf The irony is that the so-called vaccinations and culling are failing to protect the flocks, making them more vulnerable to infection, no different than humans and covid. This is an economic assault upon Americans by a government still ‘infected’ by Big Pharma. THAT’s our egg “crisis.” Now they’re pushing it to livestock & dairy cows. But don’t take my word for it: Go look for yourself. 12 posted on 02/18/2025 8:47:01 PM PST by logi_cal869 (-cynicus the "concern troll" a/o 10/03/2018 /!i!! &@$%&*(@ -) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul. The CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the Covid-era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated.6. The Kawaoka Bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well.7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR). Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled.10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Title: Mastercard Says It Has Moved Beyond Experimentation in Crypto, Focused on 'Real Solutions'
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/18/mastercard-says-it-has-moved-beyond-experimentation-in-crypto-focused-on-real-solutions

Traditional finance firms that have adopted crypto are moving past the experimentation phase and are actively working on real-world solutions, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, told CoinDesk. “Many of us in the industry are moving beyond experimentation; it’s actually real solutions,” he said, noting that Mastercard has already enabled stablecoin payments for financial institutions. Those institutions can choose to settle transactions using stablecoins, reflecting a broader trend in crypto adoption. Last week, the payments giant announced a partnership with crypto compliance firm Notabene, which will integrate Mastercard’s Crypto Credential into its SafeTransact platform to make digital asset transactions more secure and user-friendly. The Crypto Credential system continues to be a focus of Mastercard’s efforts to make crypto more mainstream. It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient’s wallet can receive a specific asset. “What is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,” Dhamodharan said. Mastercard’s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments. “As an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,” he said. Previously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later. “Binance is a great partner of ours,” Dhamodharan said. “We continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.” Dhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. “​​If there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,” he said. In 2025, Mastercard’s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said. “We think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.” Read more: Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain Helene is a New York-based news reporter at CoinDesk, covering news about Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and updates on crypto exchanges.

Title: Newcomers To The Fintech 50 2025

Stacy Greiner, DailyPay CEO F or private financial technology companies, last year was a quiet one for fundraising. Fintechs raised $34 billion in 2024, down from $42 billion in 2023 and an all-time high of $144 billion in 2021, reports CB Insights. Yet a large group of young companies, some founded as much as a decade ago, started to hit their stride in 2024, showing impressive innovation and fast growth. On our 2025 Fintech 50 list, 18 of the 50 winners had never before made the cut. The Payments category claimed the most first-timers, with six. DailyPay, led by former marketing executive Stacy Greiner, who became CEO last year, lets employees access their wages right after they’ve earned them. The 10-year-old company counts more than 1,000 businesses, including Hilton and Kroger, as customers, and last year it expanded to become available to more than five million employees. San Francisco-based Highnote, another newcomer, makes software that lets businesses issue customizable debit and credit cards, and it more recently launched a product that helps businesses accept online credit and debit payments, putting it in competition with companies like Stripe. It raised $90 million in new funding at a valuation of more than $750 million in January 2025. Squire, a New York company led by former lawyer Songe LaRon, helps barbershops do everything from schedule appointments to accept payments; last year it processed $740 million in transactions, up from $590 million in 2023. In our Business to Business Banking category, which had three-first timers, Arc is a commercial bank specializing in private credit. It has a lending platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics and provides cash management and treasury products to businesses. In 2024, it processed $4 billion in loan applications and more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Parafin is a small business lender founded by three former Robinhood data scientists. It uses data from marketplaces like Walmart, DoorDash and Amazon to underwrite loans, instead of relying on credit scores or personal guarantees from the owners. In 2024, Parafin reached 25,000 borrowers, and its revenue more than doubled to $75 million. Our Wall Street and Enterprise category also had three companies making their debut on the Fintech 50. Brico, founded by former consultant and fintech product manager Snigdha Kumar, helps fintechs and other nonbank financial players automate the cumbersome state-by-state licensing process and other regulatory requirements. It has landed customers like card issuer Marqeta and Bilt, a consumer credit card startup that also made its debut on our list this year (in the personal finance category). Another first-timer, fraud prevention firm DataVisor, was cofounded by Chinese immigrants Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, both with U.S. PhDs in computer science. It uses patented machine learning algorithms to flag fraudulent payments and grew its revenue 67% in 2024, reaching $50 million. Zip makes software that organizes and orchestrates the complex processes of procurement, visualizing the steps necessary for a business to complete a purchase. Just four years after its founding, Zip reached a $2.2 billion valuation last fall, and its customers include OpenAI, Snowflake and Prudential. Real estate was our smallest category on the list this year, with just two companies making the cut overall. Yet even with high interest rates creating a tough environment for real estate, one was a first-timer. Newcomer Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. It has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024. Across all categories, lending businesses seem to be making a comeback from years ago, when they were often maligned by industry investors and CEOs. Among our 18 first-timers, six are lenders, including Arc, Aven, Bilt, Figure, Imprint and Parafin. Headquarters: San Francisco, California. Arc is a neo-commercial bank specializing in private credit and relies on artificial intelligence instead of traditional analysts. It offers two core services: commercial banking, which provides cash management and treasury solutions, and a capital markets platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics. These metrics are shared with a network of lenders, including private credit funds and banks. With its more efficient, AI-reliant model, Arc charges about 1% for debt offerings, compared to the 3% to 5% charged by traditional banks. In 2024, Arc processed over $4 billion in loan applications; its largest deal was $200 million and average loans were in the tens of millions. Funding: $31 million from Bain Capital Ventures, NFX and Left Lane, among others. Latest valuation: $105 million. Date of last valuation: June 30, 2022. Bona fides: In 2024, it more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Founders: Don Muir, CEO, 32, a Stanford MBA who started his career at Boston Consulting Group; President Nick Lombardo, 33, a Stanford MBA who worked in investment banking at Credit Suisse before moving into private equity at AEA Investors. Headquarters: Campbell, California. Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The application process can be completed in minutes, and the cards typically arrive within a week. Typical customers are high earners who make over $100,000 and have high credit scores. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. Funding: $288 million from Khosla Ventures, Caffeinated Capital and Max Levchin, among others. Latest valuation: $1 billion. Date of last valuation: April 2024. Bona fides: The company has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024. Cofounders: CEO Sadi Khan, 39; Murtada Shah, 43; and Collin Wikman, 37. Khan spent over a decade at Microsoft and Meta before launching Aven in 2020. Headquarters: New York, New York.

David Fortunato has worked at Wealthfront for 16 years and was named CEO in 2021. T he stock market has never been higher, but that doesn’t mean it’s an easy time to start a fintech aimed at investors. In an industry saturated with legacy players like Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock and Charles Schwab that offer easy access to funds for retail investors with minuscule management fees, it’s difficult to scale fast enough to offer a product to retail investors at a competitive price. It wasn’t always so. Forbes put Robinhood on our very first Fintech 50 list in 2015. Back then, the startup was catalyzing the race to the bottom in fees by offering commission-free trading. (Its business instead relies on the controversial practice of payment for order flow from the market makers who execute its clients’ trades.) The now-public Robinhood had a phenomenal year. Its stock has quadrupled since the start of 2024, fueled by three consecutive quarters with a net profit of at least $150 million. Its assets under custody at the end of November were $195 billion, up 106% year-over-year. We’re still searching for the next Robinhood. Just two firms were selected for this year’s Fintech 50 in the investing category, making way for more up-and-comers in other areas like payments and personal finance. That meant dropping a few multi-time list members like iCapital, a longtime mainstay which partners with financial advisors to expand access to alternative investments and crossed $200 billion in assets invested through its platform last year, but with a growth rate now more indicative of a maturing business than an early-stage rocket ship. One exception to the rule, Wealthfront, which was founded in 2008, made the first Fintech 50 list in 2015 and then dropped off until 2024. It’s been growing too fast to ignore. With $80 billion in assets under management, up from $55 billion a year ago, it has left every other new-age robo-advisor in the dust. Its revenue grew 46% last year and has soared 260% in a two-year span, from $80 million in 2022 to $289 million in 2024. It charges a 0.25% management fee and also earns some interest on customers’ cash deposits and loans it extends. The lone other investing startup on the list, Capitalize, is appearing for the second straight year after raising a $19 million Series B round in August. Capitalize simplifies the task of tracking down and rolling over old 401(k) accounts, a useful service given the growing prevalence of workplace retirement savings accounts, even if job-hopping has slowed from its frenzied pace in 2022. Capitalize is free for individual users and generates revenue by charging IRA providers like Robinhood, SoFi or Schwab for facilitating asset transfers onto their platforms. Headquarters: New York, New York. Capitalize helps users track down and combine old 401(k) accounts—the company estimates there’s $1.65 trillion in unclaimed retirement assets out there—into a rollover IRA at one of its partners, which include Schwab, SoFi and Betterment. It replaces the tedious process of phone calls and paperwork with a simple online experience and also serves financial institutions, which can integrate Capitalize’s software to handle rollovers for their clients. In 2024, the company added Ellevest and M1 to its roster of rollover IRA partners and raised $19 million in Series B funding. Funding: $35 million from RRE, Canapi and Walkabout, among others. Bona fides: Increased annualized rollover volume on the platform in 2024 to $3 billion from $750 million the year before. Cofounders: CEO Gaurav Sharma, 40, a veteran of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, JPMorgan’s Highbridge and UBS; CTO Christopher Phillips, 49, who was CTO for IAC’s Applications Group. Headquarters: Palo Alto, California. Wealthfront is a profitable robo-advisor with $80 billion in assets under management in prepackaged stock and bond portfolios and cash accounts currently yielding 4% interest. Its $289 million in revenue comes from the 0.25% management fee it charges, interest on customers’ cash deposits it earns from partner banks and interest from loans it makes, among other business lines. In May 2024, it introduced an automated bond ladder for users offering a portfolio of U.S. Treasuries, which are exempt from state income taxes, with bonds maturing at different dates to provide steady income. That product now yields over 4.1%, net of the management fee. Funding: $230 million from Tiger Global Management, Index Ventures and Spark Capital, among others. Latest valuation: $1.4 billion. Date of last valuation: September 2022. Bona fides: Revenue grew 46% in 2024 to $289 million; user base increased to 1.1 million from 750,000. Cofounders: Chairman Andy Rachleff, 66, who also cofounded venture capital firm Benchmark; chief strategy officer Dan Carroll, 43. CEO: David Fortunato, 39, an Amherst College alum who was Wealthfront’s CTO for a decade and took over from Rachleff in 2021. Forbes

Carlos Domingo, Securitize I n 2024, crypto finally went mainstream. The approval of a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs triggered a flood of institutional capital, transforming what had been a market dominated by retail speculators into one gaining broader acceptance on Wall Street. Then came Donald Trump's election victory, which sent digital assets soaring on hopes that his administration would usher in a golden age for crypto. By December, bitcoin had shattered the $100,000 mark. Trump’s pro-crypto stance became clear early, marked by key appointments and orders: entrepreneur and venture capitalist David Sacks was named AI and Crypto Czar, Scott Bessent took over at Treasury, and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins was nominated to lead the regulatory agency. Trump also signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which, among other initiatives, called for the assessment of a “national digital asset stockpile.” In this climate, firms like Figure, Securitize, and Fireblocks thrived, riding some of the industry's most prominent trends. Take tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—a concept that has evolved from buzzword to billion-dollar business. Case in point: Figure, cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, is applying blockchain technology to traditional lending, having tokenized more than $13 billion in home equity lines of credit. Securitize, meanwhile, partnered with BlackRock to launch BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. treasury product that has already attracted $640 million in investments. Then there’s Fireblocks, a leader in crypto infrastructure. Having secured over $6 trillion in digital asset transactions, the company isn’t slowing down. It recently introduced a state-regulated custody platform and AI-driven trading optimization tools designed to meet the growing needs of institutional clients. Here are the three fintech companies that made the Fintech 50 in 2025: Headquarters: New York, New York. Cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Figure uses technology to speed up the process of getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It also has a customized blockchain platform that tokenizes (i.e., securitizes) and sells HELOCs to yield-hungry investors through its own private credit marketplace. Figure’s revenue grew by more than 50% in 2024 to $321 million, up from $196 million in 2023, with a 55% gross profit margin. Some 70% of its 150,000 clients have come through its more than 200 fintech and mortgage banking partners, including real estate platforms such as RATE (formerly Guaranteed Rate) and Intuit’s Credit Karma. In April, Michael Tannenbaum, a former Brex executive, became CEO and Cagney became executive chair. Funding: $500 million from Apollo, Morgan Creek and Ribbit, among others. Latest valuation: $3.2 billion. Date of last valuation: May 2021. Bona fides: Its software has been used to originate more than $13 billion of HELOCs. Cofounders: Executive chair Mike Cagney, 53; June Ou, 59, previously president and now an advisor. CEO: Michael Tannenbaum, who previously held roles as chief revenue officer at SoFi and chief operating officer at Brex before joining Figure in 2024. Headquarters: New York, New York. Its software helps investors, as well as institutions like Worldpay, Revolut, BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, hold cryptocurrencies securely. The company, which was unprofitable in 2024 despite booking $124 million in revenue, is spending big on new initiatives to support the digital asset activities of everyone from banks to startups. Notable product launches over the past year include a New York state regulated limited-purpose trust company designed to offer bank-grade custody to clients and an artificial intelligence tool that helps clients be more responsive to market events with their trading activity. Funding: $1 billion from Spark Capital, Cyberstarts and Coatue, among others. Latest valuation: $8 billion. Date of last valuation: January 2022. Bona fides: Since founding, its infrastructure has supported more than $6 trillion in trades. Cofounders: CEO Michael Shaulov, 42, who previously founded cyber security startup Lacoon Mobile Security; chief technology officer Pavel Berengoltz, 48; chief product officer Idan Ofrat, 43.

Title: AI startup Groq once almost ran out of money, so the CEO took a page from World War II fundraising

Time Published: 2025-02-18T05:54:05Z

Semiconductor startup Groq was once so close to going broke that the CEO took inspiration from the US's fundraising during World War II. Jonathan Ross, who founded the company in 2016 with a group of former Google engineers, said that it took seven years to find a product that would sell. When a cash crunch approached, the CEO told his employees, "'We're going to run out of money. We need you to trade salary for equity,'" Ross said in an episode of The Twenty Minute VC podcast uploaded on Monday. He likened the ask to World War II bonds, through which governments asked citizens to help finance their military efforts amid a depressed economy. "We literally took pictures of the war bonds and we put Groq Bonds on it instead," he said. Ross said it was an "intense" decision because people who had left their careers elsewhere and had families were banking on him. He said that they were worried everyone would leave — but 80% of employees participated. The cash compensation reduction helped Groq stay afloat before the startup raised the first portion of a $300 million fundraising round. In 2021, the AI hardware and software company closed a $300 million funding round, co-led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital. Last week, Groq inked a deal for $1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia to expand delivery of its advanced AI chips to the Middle Eastern country. In August, the company was valued at $2.8 billion after it raised $640 million from a round led by BlackRock, Cisco Investments, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Paying employees partially in equity instead of all cash is common for both public and private tech companies. These shares encourage employee retention and serve as a performance incentive. Employees often trade higher cash compensation at established companies for lower cash and equity options at a startup, betting the equity could soar. Early-stage startups sometimes temporarily reduce cash compensation in favor of equity in the company when they are in danger of running out of money. Grok's CEO is one of the few business leaders who has been public about the decision. "If you lean towards that vulnerability, people are often going to go with you," Ross said on Monday about his employees sticking with Groq. Some of the world's largest startups, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, have allowed employees to sell their shares through tender offers, letting them cash out even though the company opts to stay private or does not want to be acquired. A tender offer gives employees of private companies a chance to sell a certain number of shares at a fixed price during a limited timeframe. Correction: February 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Groq's name in the eighth paragraph. Jump to

Title: Who Is Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure?

Yves here. I have retitled the post by John Ruehl because I regard the original title, which reflects the positioning of the piece to be misleading. Ruehl, playing on xenophobia, had declared: Foreign Companies Are Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure. In reality, this is pure and simple class warfare. Here, capitalists, mainly in the form of big fund managers and their investors, profit at the expense of the broader citizenry. A popular vote on these matters (with accurate briefs) would almost certainly lead to rejection of the economic proposal, “Sell the family china and rent it back at inflated prices.” Admittedly, Sydney-based Macquarie Bank was a pioneer and early leader in infrastructure finance, which grew out of its expertise in project finance, particularly big mining deals. Macquarie’s initial move to the pole position reflected the fact that infrastructure deals were technically difficult due to the many moving parts and there were less taxing ways in investment banking to make similar amounts of money (another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry). But as you can see, half of the biggest infrastructure funds are American, including the biggest, a BlackRock entity.,US concerns also represent more than half the funds raised in this top echelon. From Infrastructure Investor 100: Ruehl starts by showcasing the infamous sale of Chicago’s parking meters, a deal we lambasted in detail close to when it was first inked. Ruehl goes though hoops to depict the city as abused by furrniers because it was largely foreign investors who picked up the equity in the deal…after Morgan Stanley, who structured the original deal, defaulted. Ruehl does not understand or acknowledge that the continued extraction from Chicago results from the original, one-sided terms Morgan Stanley got the clueless city to agree to. This blaming foreigners for the very successful and durable predation by Morgan Stanley is seriously off base. Similarly, Ruehl points to the fact that the US is the major market for sale of government owned assets. The US runs chronic trade deficits. That means we import capital. We do that via sales of securities and other assets. If the US was not running such large and persistent trade deficits, we’d have a lot less in the way of this property-hawking (not that we are fans of the Trump tariffs, but indifference to our yawning trade deficits is part of how we wound up here). Ruehl raises the specter of evil funniners using ISDS to enforce their rights. Again, see the Morgan Stanley example. The contracts for infrastructure sales are exceedingly investor-favorable. It is hard to see a scenario where a government entity in the US (where precedents are well-set) could wriggle out of one in US courts. And that’s before getting to the fact that the big private equity and fund management firms are far and away (as a group) the biggest buyers of sophisticated legal services. Not only would it be hard to find a firm with decent expertise that was not conflicted out and/or was unwilling to make it impossible to ever be engaged by the big financiers by opposing them. A government entity suing a general partner is a one off. That also makes it a less attractive legal matter. Moreover, as far as I can tell (again given the pre-existing investor-friendly legal climate in the US), ISDS cases against US government entities are rare (I can’t recall ever hearing of one but knowledgeable readers please pipe up). I suspect to the extent they happen, they relate to state environmental or labor laws. Consistent with that: The United States is the most frequent home state of investors litigating ISDS cases, which have brought 174 cases against other states to date. Finally, Ruehl is unduly concerned with the general partner(s) in these investments and not the limited partners. As with private equity, public pension funds, as in managing money for government employees, are top participants, along with private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, family offices, and life insurers. Admittedly, Canadian and Australian public pension fund managers were early to this party. But fixating on the national angle obscures the fact that this is yet another facet of how rentiers pinch the public purse. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute On February 4, 2025, Chicago’s business community pushed back against Mayor Brandon Johnson’s proposal to raise real estate transfer taxes, adding to the city’s ongoing economic struggles. Besides a struggling pension fund, high home prices, and other factors, a significant contributor to the city’s woes lies in the controversial privatization initiatives from the 2000s, known as the “Great Chicago Sell-Off.” Over the past two decades, these decisions have siphoned an estimated $3 to $4 billion from Chicago. The privatization trend began under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, starting with the Chicago Skyway. In 2005, the 7.8-mile toll road was leased to a consortium led by Spain’s Ferrovial and Australia’s Macquarie Group for $1.83 billion. Tolls were raised immediately, and in 2016, the 99-year lease was sold to “a trio of Canadian pension funds” (the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP)) for $2.8 billion. Australia’s Atlas Arteria Ltd. then acquired a two-thirds stake for $2 billion in 2022, while OTTP retained the remainder. In 2006, four downtown parking garages with more than 9,000 spaces were leased for 99 years to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. After Morgan Stanley defaulted on its debt tied to the lease agreement, control was transferred in 2014 to lenders, including France’s Societe Generale, the German government, and Italy’s UniCredit S.p.A. In 2016, Australia’s AMP Capital and Canada’s Northleaf Capital Partners acquired the garages. Abu Dhabi came into the picture in 2008. In a $1.16 billion deal, 36,000 parking meters were sold to Chicago Parking Meters (CPM) LLC for 75 years, a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley’s Infrastructure group soon restructured CPM’s ownership, transferring major stakes to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany’s Allianz through complex investment vehicles. Over the next five years, parking fees more than doubled. By 2022, CPM recovered its entire $1.16 billion investment, while the city had spent $78.8 million buying back parking spots to cover the revenue it would have generated until 2084. As of 2024, the investment has returned $700 million, with 60 years left on the lease. Daley’s goal was to balance the city’s budget without raising property taxes before leaving office. However, the one-time payments resulted in long-term consequences. In addition to financial losses, the privatization deals have hindered Chicago’s ability to modernize infrastructure by limiting efforts to build bike lanes and reduce car dependence downtown, and people even need to get permission or make payments to companies thousands of miles away for local street parades. Growing Privatization Profit-driven entities argue that privatizing public infrastructure leads to greater efficiency through expertise and investment. However, their focus is on profit maximization, not service improvement, leading to long-term rent-seeking behavior. Furthermore, in contracts with limited liability companies, the government assumes the losses, while private companies reap the profits. Companies can walk away or demand renegotiations, while governments are left to maintain services, absorb long-term revenue losses, and burden the public with higher costs. As Chicago’s experience shows, privatization has extended beyond domestic markets to become an international phenomenon. Starting in the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reforms encouraged the privatization of public infrastructure to attract investment, leading to its internationalization. “A 2006 study by the Norwegian government of IMF conditionality revealed that 23 out of 40 poor countries still have privatization and liberalization conditions attached to their IMF loans,” stated an Oxfam Briefing Paper. By 2000, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and multinational corporations began treating infrastructure as a global asset class, involving extended leases that frequently change hands. Foreign companies operate under bilateral investment treaties or trade agreements, allowing them to bypass local courts. Disputes are often mediated in foreign courts or through international arbitration, such as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and the World Trade Organization. By exploiting legal loopholes like offshore subsidiaries and tax havens, companies can also shield profits while facing little public scrutiny. Despite these issues, domestic infrastructure continues to be increasingly available on international markets. United States While Chicago remains the most prominent American example, similar deals are widespread across the country, primarily involving companies from allied or dependent nations. In 1998, Atlanta became one of the first cities to enter into an international privatization deal over public services, signing a 20-year and $428 million contract with United Water, a subsidiary of France’s corporate conglomerate Suez, to operate the city’s water system. Celebrated as the biggest privatization contract in the U.S. at the time, it led to claims of quality decline, delays, and other mismanagement before the contract was terminated, leading to the infrastructure being returned to public control in 2003. Nonetheless, the trend continued. By 2006, foreign companies were leasing and operating 80 percent of U.S. port terminals along with a smaller share of the nation’s airports. The UK’s National Grid owns and operates electric transmission networks in the northeastern U.S. Indiana has since become a prominent example of experimenting with international privatization. France’s Veolia entered a 20-year contract to manage Indianapolis’s waterworks in 2002. The deal was, however, eventually canceled in 2010. Meanwhile, its airport was managed by Britain’s BAA from 1994 to 2007. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to a foreign consortium led by Spanish and Australian companies for 75 years for $3.8 billion. It was later sold for $5.7 billion to Australia’s IFM Investors in 2015. United States entities have purchased some infrastructure abroad, such as in 1999, when a subsidiary of Bechtel privatized Cochabamba’s water system in Bolivia before controversy forced its exit. But for a major economy, the U.S. owns surprisingly little foreign infrastructure. It has few state-owned enterprises for overseas infrastructure investment, though some private entities like Blackstone’s Infrastructure Partners division and Corsair Capital are active. Instead, extensive domestic privatization opportunities have made U.S. infrastructure a prime target for American and foreign investors. Canadian and Australian Companies Canadian and Australian pension funds and other entities, driven by well-funded systems, consolidation, government support, and early privatization experience, have become major infrastructure investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The CPPIB owns toll roads worldwide, the OTPP holds stakes in airports across Europe, along with the Channel Tunnel, while the Canadian company Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns telecom infrastructure across Europe. Roughly half of Australia’s pension pool is invested outside the country. But Australia’s Macquarie Group, in particular, has seen its assets surge, emerging as the “world’s largest infrastructure asset manager.” Since the 1990s, Macquarie Group has focused on identifying underperforming or undervalued public assets to acquire and restructure, and it established its Global Infrastructure Fund in 2001 “to invest in infrastructure financing opportunities in the U.S., Canada, UK, and the European Union,” according to its website. In addition to Chicago’s Skyway, Macquarie holds long-term operational licenses for the Dulles Greenway toll road in Virginia and the Foley Beach Expressway in Alabama, among others. Macquarie’s toll road portfolio in India is worth an estimated $2 billion, and it took a 49 percent stake in Greece’s largest utility, Public Power Corporation (PPC) in 2021. It also led the push for privatizing the UK’s Bristol Airport in 2001, while Britain’s largest water utility was sold to an international consortium led by Macquarie Group from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie also took full ownership of the UK’s National Gas Network in 2023. According to a July 2023 Guardian article, “Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. ​​The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent.” Europe The UK has been a major market for infrastructure investors since the global wave of privatization in the 1980s. Beyond Macquarie’s infrastructure holdings, the UK’s largest electricity generation company was privatized and acquired by France’s EDF in 2009. Foreign investors have continued to diversify, with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) poised to take over Newcastle Airport, after acquiring a 37.6 percent stake in Heathrow with French co-investor Ardian in 2024. Europe’s collective experience with infrastructure privatization has been marked by controversy, largely due to Western European corporate dominance. As the EU expanded, some Western EU companies bought control of critical infrastructure in Eastern EU member states. In 2015, Greece privatized 14 regional airports handing them over to a consortium led by the German company Fraport. This move was unpopular in Greece, especially following the austerity measures imposed by the EU and Germany during Greece’s economic crisis. However, the EU also provides safeguards in such deals, including profit sharing and economic support to member states. Outside the EU, resolving disputes is even more challenging. French water companies like Veolia and Suez are leaders in global privatization efforts but have ended up in court over dealings with Argentina in the 1990s, Egypt in the 2000s, and Gabon in the 2010s. Argentina renationalized its oil company from Spanish company Repsol in 2012 after domestic backlash, damaging relations between the two countries. Such cases can be particularly sensitive when they involve former colonial powers and their former colonies, as economic disputes risk being seen as extensions of past dominance, with former ruling states accused of leveraging privatization to maintain influence. China China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) predominantly focuses on building infrastructure in non-Western countries, though the 2020 takeover of Laos’ electric grid shows an exception. In contrast, Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021. China’s competitive pricing, substantial financial and productive resources, and strategic interests have extended its infrastructure influence to countries with their own expansive foreign infrastructure portfolios. Chinese firms hold stakes in Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian ports, as well as European energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In Australia, the Port of Darwin was leased for 99 years in 2015 to China’s Landbridge Group, with the Australian government resisting pressure to cancel the deal. The State Grid Corporation of China and its subsidiaries, meanwhile, hold large stakes in Australia’s electricity and gas infrastructure, raising national security concerns due to its close ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. Furthermore, China’s control over Australian agricultural land has granted it valuable water rights. The geopolitical implications of these foreign investments in infrastructure are undeniable, with national security concerns forcing China to sell its stake in the U.S. Port of Long Beach in 2019. Yet such investments are only becoming more common globally. While they may strengthen economic ties between countries, they reduce accountability, risk undermining sovereignty, and disconnect public services from local oversight, sidelining effective public planning in favor of enriching foreign entities. This trend appears likely to continue, requiring more responsible approaches to maintaining a healthy balance between the necessity for infrastructure investment and public needs. Shorter contracts, profit-sharing models, and performance-based agreements could help countries and companies showcase their development models and expertise—potentially even at lower costs than local providers. However, profit maximization remains the driving force, particularly when financial entities dominate the field. The question that should always be asked when looking at privatizing infrastructure is “can it be allowed to fail?” If it’s a no, then do not privatize or seek third party private investment. Speaking from the UK, where everything not bolted to the floor has been privatized. Brits forgot their history…: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Riots Our “conservatives” of all political parties appeal to tradition but find it convenient to ignore or forget history. Hello Yves, could you please explain this part “another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry).” did not quite get it. Thank you Female dominated professions and roles are less well paid and prestigious. This is particularly true in finance. Well, it’s a well known fact, isn’t it, that men go into lucrative professions like male lawyers, male engineers, male doctors, and so forth, whereas women go into less remunerative women’s professions like female lawyers, female engineers, and female doctors? FER SHER! The article is useful if one thinks of the problems of allowing capital to flow freely without regulation — which is more or less what is going on. These unbridled movements of capital are one of the sources of the current assertion of oligarchy in the U S of A. Having lived through the give-away in Chicago, I appreciate Yves Smith’s skepticism up top. The problem was *not* that foreigners and the Spanish peril were swooping in to take Chicago’s assets. The problem was that the entrenched Daley / Obama / Rahm Emanuel Democrats were only too happy to give away pieces of the public sphere. It was / is part of their fantasy of “reinventing” government. At the time of the parking-meter scamola, there was no reason given why the city couldn’t manage its own parking meters. Meanwhile, scads of bucks were / are flowing into Chicago’s swamp of tax-increment finance districts, better known as TIFs and slush funds. Here in Italy, there are plenty of U.S. entities showing up to loot the public space at the invitation of Fratelli d’Italia and the Lega (believe it or not). TIM, the Italian phone company, is now owned by KKR investment bank, although there are rumors of a buyout by an EU company. The Italian government keeps threatening to offer pieces of the FFSS, the Italian state railway system. I can hardly wait for U.S. companies to buy a slice of the FFSS and then offer lessons on how to turn the Italian railway system, which is of the highest quality, into AMTRAK. Yes, this idea that foreigners swooped in is nonsense. As you noted, powers that be were only too happy to sell out, citizens be damned. This from the article was quite the handwave – “…Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021.” The author fails to mention that it was the European Troika who forced the sale of this public asset as a condition of Greece being bailed out. I don’t remember the exact timeline, but at some point Greece held a referendum on austerity policies and citizens voted ‘no’, only to be overruled by technocrats and have austerity measures imposed on them. Yanis Varoufakis explained that the initial deal was very bad for Greece so the Chinese agreed to renegotiate, giving Greece much better terms. Pretty good rundown of that situation here. I think that the author is on the wrong track here. They are obsessed with all those foreign corporations buying up everything but they should be looking at who is running those corporations and not which countries those corporations come from. On that level, those executives do not really care which passport – or passports – they hold and they have much more in common with executives running other foreign corporations rather than with people from the country that they actually come from. Probably the only time they wave the flag of the country that they come from is to impress the hicks in their home country but truth be told, find it more comfortable mixing with executives from other countries even if they are direct competitors. After all, this is truly their people. All roads lead to Rome, as it were. My evil multinational had a serious slice of shares acquired by both Blackrock and Vanguard over the past few years and now it’s one set of RIFs after another and “AI” pushed like it’s magically going to replace HR, Research, Application Development and of course, Legal, because lawyers have always been the biggest bottleneck to doing business. Like DOGE, I see this as a current of immature thinking about superstructure and systems. When it all breaks down, I guess there will be no further bottlenecks to business doing whatever the heck it wants. So long as they’ve got the bagmen and enforcers to keep the princes in line. Thank you, Yves. I recognise the first five and BlackStone from workshops with Labour in opposition. Labour has prioritised these giants in government, much to the private chagrin of UK investors, but no one dares complain in public. US firms pay better than peers from elsewhere. In addition and on current polling, Labour is unlikely to form the next government, so Labour politicians and even officials in Whitehall are prioritising their nest eggs after 2029. It feels terminal in Blighty, so one may as well sell everything to Wall Street. Plus, when BlackRock visits Downing Street, Angela Rayner can get handsy with Larry Fink. The NC community can read these and weep for Blighty: https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/treasury-incompetence/ and https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/streeting-rotten-to-the-core/. Not unrelated: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/defence-secretarys-speech-on-defence-reform–2. What is it about these politicians, many of whom have not “worked” outside politics, but think the government is a business? Pat McFadden is another. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. This is all aided and abetted by the mainstream economics professions which chronically fails to even apply its own basic and foundational principles to properly critique these situations. The driver of this is that mainstream economics has long since abandon the discussion of monopolies or monopoly economics. You see in micro economics 101 we all learn that in a competitive market, price is where the demand curve and the supply curve meet. However, if you venture further up the ladder of economic theory you will learn that the supply curve discussed in econ 101 is the upward sloping portion of a firms marginal cost curve. Here’s where the problem is… every economic study that has tried to understand what the real world shape of real world businesses marginal cost curves are keeps coming back with the same answer… only a small minority of entities actually have a business where their margin costs are rising as output increases. The majority of businesses face a downward sloping margin cost curve. Conveniently the majority of mainstream economics just keeps on ignoring this even though in that same econ 101 class there is probably at least a brief discussion about firms that do face downward sloping marginal cost curves. They are called natural monopolies. The real-world implication of this is that most businesses will act like a real monopoly if they are allowed to. So it should be no surprise to anyone (including economists who shamefully ignore this reality) that when you privatize what is invariably a fairly large entity with few, if any competitors, that they maximize their rent extractions at the expense of their customers and even the business they are supposed to be running. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. It’s never better, is it? You and I understand ‘efficiency’ in terms of how well our tools work, how far our car drives per tank. That’s the wrong meaning of the word; when a capitalist says ‘efficiency’, the only thing meant is more profit per $ of revenue, so anything that cuts cost is by definition ‘efficient’. Hi Yves, In response to your question about ISDS cases against the US, they did happen under NAFTA Chapter 11, but never succeeded, which is probably why you never heard about them. Some of the bigger ones (Methanex, 1999, brought against California for phasing out the gasoline additive MTBE, and Glamis Gold, 2003, also brought against California, this time for a law requiring restoration of open-pit mines) related to state environmental laws, as you suggested. A number of them concerned the softwood lumber disputes and were terminated with the new softwood lumber agreement in 2006. By contrast, as of 2018 (before the renegotiation of NAFTA under Trump), Canada had lost 8 cases and Mexico 5. Many of the ISDS provisions under Chapter 11 were removed from the USMCA, which was a win for Canada and Mexico. Sacramento did a similar sell off of parking meter & garages 10ish years ago then used the money to build a new downtown arena for the NBA franchise. Bonus! The City owns the stadium, so the NBA team can threaten to move and extort even more money from the City–or leave it with a money-losing white elephant. The Oakland Raiders did this in Oakland, Anaheim, Oakland again and now Las Vegas. George W. Bush practiced something similar in Arlington, TX, persuading the public to fund a stadium for the (money losing) MLB Texas Rangers. W. then sold his stake in the team (which he purchased with borrowed money), and that sale accounts for 75% of his net worth. Sacramento has a large and growing homeless population, but while it can afford a quarter-billion-dollar stadium, somehow help for the homeless is just too darn expensive.

Title: Colorado Bill Would Require Businesses To Disclose Climate Emissions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/02/17/colorado-bill-would-require-businesses-to-disclose-climate-emissions/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T23:44:53Z
Full Content:
Denver, Colorado USA:Gold plated roof top of the Capitol Building of Denver Colorado Colorado has joined the wave of states considering requiring businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions. This follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing it will eliminate the reporting requirement that was adopted in 2024, but never went into effect. If passed, businesses with a presence in Colorado and over $1 billion in revenue will be required to start reporting as soon as 2028. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. A multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive sustainability and environmental, social, and governance. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. In February, the acting chair of the SEC announced that the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was in the process of being repealed. Focus now shifts to the states. In September 2023, California approved the Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. Senate Bill 253 required companies that do business in California and have an excess of $1 billion in revenue, defined as “reporting entities,” to submit an annual report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 starting in 2026. Scope 3 reporting will begin in 2027. California is still drafting the applicable regulations and the reporting timeline is likely to be delayed. Now, Colorado is following suit. House Bill 25-1119, titled “Requiring Certain Entities to Disclose Information Concerning Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” was introduced on January 28 by state representative Manny Rutinel, a Democrat. The bill mimics the requirements of the California legislation. Reporting entities is defined as “an entity that does business in Colorado and has total revenues exceeding one billion dollars in the preceding calendar year, including revenues received by all of the businesses entity’s subsidiaries that do business in Colorado.” The scope of “does business in” has come into question in California and is causing problems for businesses trying to determine if they fall under the reporting requirement or not. It will be interesting to see how Colorado addresses this issue. The reporting of Scope 1, the direct GHG emissions of the company, and Scope 2, the GHG emissions of their energy provider tied to the business’ energy consumption, will begin reporting by January 1, 2027, for the 2027 annual year. Scope 3 reporting will be phased in using a unique definition. Broadly, the bill defines Scope 3 as GHG emissions “other than Scope 2, that are from sources that a reporting entity does not own or directly control. ‘Scope 3 Emissions’ may include emissions associated with a reporting entity’s supply chain, business travel, employee commutes, procurement, waste, and water usage, regardless of location.” By Jan. 1, 2029, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2028 calendar year from "purchased goods and services, capital goods, and the use of sold products." By Jan. 1, 2030, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2029 calendar year from “emissions from fuel and energy activities, which emissions are not classified as Scope 1 emissions or Scope 2 emissions; waste generated in operations; processing of sold products; and the end of life of sold products.” By Jan. 1, 2031, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2030 calendar year from “upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, upstream leased assets, downstream transportation and distribution, downstream leased assets, and franchises.” Notably, the timing of the reporting requirement is, in my opinion, unobtainable. It is unreasonable to require businesses to report GHG emissions from the preceding calendar year on January 1. Most jurisdictions allow six months for businesses to process the information and compile the reports. I expect this will be change as the bill goes through the legislative process. Unique to Colorado, enforcement is delegated to the district attorney and attorney general. If a business fails to comply with the disclosure requirement, they may be prosecuted and face a penalty of $100,000 per day. I expect that to be reduced or otherwise amended. It is too early in the legislative session to predict the chances the bill will make it through the Colorado General Assembly and become law. Democrats control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Likewise, Governor Jared Polis is Democrat. This greatly increases the likelihood the bill will make it through the legislative process. However, do not underestimate the business lobby’s efforts to kill the bill or make substantial changes.

That’s a goldmine for Robinhood, whose customers collectively hold 35 billion DOGE, or about 24% of the token’s entire supply. At current prices, that stash is worth $8.8 billion, though it briefly ballooned to $16.4 billion in December. Crypto has become Robinhood’s cash cow. Q4 results show that digital assets were its top revenue driver, up 700% year-over-year to $358 million, making up 35% of net revenue. For all of 2024, the firm brought in $2.95 billion, while net income soared tenfold to $916 million. And it’s not just dog money: Robinhood’s meme coin buffet also includes BONK, Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat, Trump coin, and Pepe. Read more. COINBASE’S COMEBACK Coinbase just pulled off a comeback worthy of a bull market montage. Q4 net revenue nearly doubled to $2.2 billion, blowing past the $1.8 billion analysts expected. Net income rocketed 1,600% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, as trading volume surged 176% to $94 billion—proof that retail investors are back and betting big. Not bad for a company that just a year ago was clawing its way out of post-FTX wreckage, with revenue around $3 billion and its stock trading below $200. Now, with Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction and D.C. getting friendlier, Coinbase is inching back toward its 2021 glory days, when revenue was over $7 billion and shares briefly topped $357. CRYPTO PUSHES FOR INFLUENCE IN D.C. Crypto’s power players have stormed Washington, lobbying for influence in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, and working to shape discussions with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force under Commissioner Hester Peirce. Some had hoped for a formal role on the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, initially expected to include industry executives. But sources indicate a different approach favoring issue-specific roundtables over direct industry appointments. Read more.

Title: OpenWeb's ousted founder and CEO is back at the tech company in an advisor role after a messy boardroom battle

Nadav Shoval, the founder who was ousted as the CEO of OpenWeb by its board in a messy public battle, is back with the adtech company in an advisor role, Business Insider has learned. In an email to employees sent on Friday morning and obtained by BI, OpenWeb's interim CEO, Tim Harvey, announced that the company and Shoval had "reached a mutually agreed resolution" in which Shoval would remain connected to the company as a senior advisor to its chief executive. Later on Friday, the company published a post on its website confirming the move. OpenWeb didn't respond to requests for comment. "We resolved our differences," Shoval told BI. "The company remains committed to its mission of OpenWeb, and I'm excited to continue to support the mission in my role as senior advisor to the CEO." The settlement caps months of drama at OpenWeb that began in mid-2024. Shoval has said that he and some board members disagreed over a potential investment in the company from BlackRock. Shoval's relationship with the board became further strained after the board changed his reporting line — a move that Shoval argued was in breach of his contract because, in his view, it diminished his role and hindered his management capabilities. Shoval wrote to the board in September, demanding that it reverse the change. Later that month, the board fired him. He took the matter public, saying on LinkedIn in September that he hadn't stepped down as CEO. "I do not accept these actions," he wrote. "I will continue to fight for OpenWeb's mission and purpose alongside our team." Shoval also went the legal route. He sued OpenWeb and many of its board members in a court in Tel Aviv, Israel, in October, alleging that he had been the victim of a boardroom coup. The complaint demanded that he be reinstated as CEO and given the ability to appoint two new board members. In response to Shoval's suit, OpenWeb said in court filings that the case was a classic situation in which the board of directors had lost confidence in its CEO. OpenWeb said that Shoval was trying to extract money that was not owed to him and that he had chosen to give up control of the company when he brought in investors. Shoval confirmed that the case was settled. OpenWeb, which has about 350 employees, provides technology to help publishers boost revenue and engagement on their websites, such as comment-moderation and advertising tools. It says its clients and partners include the publishers CNN, Fox, and Hearst and the advertising companies WPP, Dentsu, and Publicis Groupe. Founded in 2012, OpenWeb has raised more than $392 million and was last valued at $1.5 billion. Its investors include the venture capital firms Insight Partners, Georgian Partners, and Index Ventures; companies like The New York Times and Dentsu; and the New York University Stern professor and podcaster Scott Galloway, who sits on the company's board.

Title: Man gets suspended sentence over bogus 999 calls
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/02/17/man-gets-suspended-sentence-over-bogus-999-calls/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T16:57:40Z
Full Content:
A man who made more than 30 bogus 999 calls over the course of two years has been given a 3½-year suspended sentence. James Kelly (32), of Rochford Green, Blackrock, Co Dublin, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to six sample charges of knowingly making a false report on dates between February 2021 and March 2023. The court heard gardaí responded to each false report, including making house-to-house inquiries and trawling through hours of CCTV footage. In one incident Kelly claimed he had been the victim of an attempted armed robbery. Gardaí responded to his 999 call, and after meeting him followed up by canvasing the local area for CCTV footage. Kelly was seen on the footage but there was no suspect robber. One officer spent 30 days canvasing footage and four months following up on the case before it was concluded there had been no crime. At a previous sentence hearing last June Judge Pauline Codd said Kelly’s behaviour was a complete waste of Garda time and resources. Sentencing Kelly on Monday, she said he had caused a great nuisance to people who have enough to be doing coping with their own workload. Judge Codd said the frequencies with which the calls were made warranted a headline sentence of five years. She took into account that urine analysis showed Kelly has tested negative for various illicit drugs and previously struggled with addiction. She noted from various testimonials that Kelly works in a voluntary capacity at a local football club and has shown he is capable of living in a pro-social manner. She imposed a sentence of 3½ years, which she suspended in full on strict conditions, including that he engage with the Probation Service for one year and with various addiction support services as directed by the Probation Service. Det Garda Gary Burns told barrister John Moher, prosecuting, at an earlier sentence hearing that a call received on January 13th, 2022, prompted the investigation into the case. The 999 call received that day reported that a fight had broken out in a particular pub and males were throwing bottles at each other. Gardaí immediately responded but when they arrived a minute later there were three people in the bar and it was very quickly established there had been no such disturbance. The 999 caller had identified himself as James. Further investigation led to the nomination of Kelly as a suspect. Kelly gave a voluntarily statement to gardaí in March 2023 having previously been arrested, detained and interviewed. He made no admissions during the initial questioning but took responsibility in his voluntary statement. He said he wanted to apologise for wasting people’s time but said he could not say why he made the calls. “I don’t know really. I think I need to see someone professionally,” he said. Kelly has two previous convictions for possession of articles and one for a public order offence. Det Gda Burns agreed with barrister Pieter Le Vert, defending, that Kelly has ongoing issues with drugs. Counsel said Kelly is a self-confessed compulsive liar. Mr Le Vert said Kelly was addicted to cocaine and alcohol. He has been trying to get into drug rehabilitation but so far has not secured a place. Mr Le Vert said on Monday that his client is now drug-free and has applied for work but has not secured a job. He is due to become a father later this year. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Congested urban regions are driving North America. North America held the major share of the eVTOL aircraft market in 2024. Modern transportation alternatives like eVTOL planes are much needed because North America is home to some of the most crowded urban areas in the world. To improve mobility and lessen traffic congestion, cities including Dallas, New York, and Los Angeles are looking at eVTOL flying taxi services. The well-established infrastructure in the region, including heliports, potential urban vertiport locations, and already-existing airports, can also make it easier to deploy eVTOL aircraft. Additionally, work is being done to build vertiports, charging stations, and maintenance facilities—infrastructure made especially for eVTOL operations. Additionally, the military and large corporations are entering into more contracts, which helps the region's economy grow. Rising technology is driving the Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is estimated to achieve a significant growth rate in the eVTOL aircraft market during the predicted timeframe. Urban congestion and increased urbanization, especially in large cities in China, India, Japan, Australia, and South Korea, are the main causes of the region's rapid growth. Emerging markets such as China and India provide substantial prospects for the eVTOL industry because of their sustained robust GDP development. Because of its steady economic growth and official backing in the form of advantageous laws, money, and alliances, China is drawing significant foreign investments. Furthermore, the development of eVTOL is supported by a strong technical ecosystem in Asia Pacific, which includes developments in battery technology, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI). These elements work together to create the perfect setting for the growth of the eVTOL business in the area. eVTOL Aircraft Market Report Coverage You can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact at sales@precedenceresearch.com | +1 804 441 9344 eVTOL Aircraft Market Segmentation Analysis: Browse More Insights: eVTOL Aircraft Market Top Companies What is Going Around the Globe?

Title: BUSTED: America First Legal Shows Judge Financially Entangled With His Own Trump Ruling...If this doesn't warrant a recusal, NOTHING does

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 6:44:11 AM PST by Red Badger The problem with judge-shopping to push your case through, there’s always the chance that the judges you are counting on to push your agenda have their own skin in the game. That’s the case with a judge who has offered very dubious rulings on whether Trump can suspend his USAID money. We’ve got a thread from America First Legal making the case online that Judge McConnell, the Rhode Island judge who put an end to Trump’s spending freezes, ought never to have heard that case in the first place. The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling. If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair. The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling. If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair. The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

The problem is that given how deep this goes everyone in the country is now one degree from someone who has been corrupted by this. It requires more than recusal, it requires an indictment... DOJ needs to get on this right now... On the other hands, Judge Merchan's daughter is working for and making big coin working on a group opposed to Trump and he laughed it off, just like this guy will. This judge can’t have much time to do his judging job. He seems more like a Blackrock fund manager, only its all for him. Been going on over a hundred years. “Business as usual” as McCain would say. And where is the American Bar Association? This creep should be disbarred for this conflict of interest ruling. Crickets. How is enriching himself a conflict of interest? Our side never goes hardcore -- because we're always worried that if the Republicans do this then when the Democrats have power, they will do that. But so many on our side don't realize that the Democrats are already doing that. Everywhere. Every chance they get. And if we notice, they laugh it off. The GOP needs to toughen up and do what's necessary. A perfect poster child for both judicial corruption and USAID corruption. To a Democrat, it isn’t.................. “And where is the American Bar Association?

This needs to get to Musk like right now... Check out the graph... That is about as obvious as it can get... They are absolutely in on the lawfare.

Title: Blockchain Rewiring TradFi: A Trillion-Dollar Shift
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/02/17/blockchain-rewiring-tradfi-a-trillion-dollar-shift/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T13:08:55Z
Full Content:
blockchain and financial technology. The race to remake global finance is heating up, and the starting gun has already fired on Wall Street. While traditional banks grapple with systems that trap trillions in idle capital, a new financial architecture is emerging from the fusion of blockchain technology and traditional finance (TradFi). The prize isn't just eliminating the friction that costs the industry billions in settlement delays and reconciliation headaches—it's fundamentally rewiring how money moves. Early movers aren't just experimenting anymore; they're driving the financial blockchain market toward a projected $49.2 billion by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. The shift isn't just theoretical. At Davos 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan likened crypto to established payment systems: "If you go down the street here and buy lunch, you could pay with Visa, Mastercard, a debit card, Apple Pay, and so on. In that sense, cryptocurrency would just be another form of payment." Behind the glass towers of Wall Street, this future is already materializing. The DTCC’s Project Ion, leveraging distributed ledger technology, is rewiring financial infrastructure’s fundamental plumbing by shifting from batch to real-time processing and creating a single, unified transaction record—slashing reconciliation costs and delivering significant savings. Already handling over 100,000 bilateral equity transactions daily, with peaks reaching 160,000 trades, Project Ion operates within today's T+2 settlement framework while blazing the trail toward T+1 and potentially T+0 settlement—a shift that could unlock billions in capital currently trapped in settlement limbo. Banking giants BNY Mellon, Citi, and JP Morgan aren't just watching from the sidelines—they're already all in. Cross-border payments remain the industry's biggest bottleneck—slow, costly, and reliant on an outdated patchwork of intermediaries. Trillions move across borders every year, yet transactions can take days, saddled with 4%+ fees and opaque banking rails. Enter stablecoins—by converting fiat into digital tokens on global blockchain networks, banks unlock 24/7, near-instant money movement at scale. This innovation lets institutions bypass correspondent banking friction entirely, settling transactions in minutes rather than days. JPMorgan Coin already processes $1 billion in daily settlements, and the broader market for tokenized dollars is on track to hit $400 billion by 2025. The economic case is striking: where traditional transfers trap money for days and drain substantial fees, blockchain-powered stablecoins deliver instant settlement at a fraction of the cost. This shift has tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon building Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, accelerating enterprise blockchain adoption. The transformation spans every corner of finance. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have launched blockchain initiatives to streamline operations, while payment giants Visa and Mastercard are integrating the technology into their global networks. Asset management leaders Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are pushing into real-world assets (RWA), recognizing blockchain's potential to transform asset tokenization and settlement. Franklin Templeton's expansion of its money market fund across Solana, Ethereum, Stellar, and other major blockchain networks signals a new phase—traditional asset managers are no longer experimenting; they're building multi-chain infrastructure for the future. Global crossborder digital payment and tokenization Three key forces are accelerating blockchain's adoption in TradFi: First, legacy banking systems struggle to meet real-time global demands; second, regulatory clarity around digital assets is improving; third, institutional investors—once skeptical—are now integrating blockchain solutions to bridge traditional and digital finance. Unlike early blockchain disruptors who sought to replace traditional finance, today's players are bridging legacy systems with digital innovation—prioritizing functionality over disruption. The road ahead presents a delicate balancing act. As banks and financial institutions embrace blockchain, they must navigate the fine line between pushing innovation forward and staying within regulatory bounds. Enterprise solutions like R3 Corda are emerging as crucial bridges, offering the institutional-grade infrastructure needed for this transition. At the same time, decentralized networks are evolving to put compliance first—pointing toward a future where innovation and regulation coexist in harmony. Among new solutions, Chainlink, Aave, and Compound are pioneering DeFi infrastructure, while Graphite Network is bridging TradFi and DeFi, offering verification and compliance-focused solutions that major institutions can trust. A reputation-based Layer 1 blockchain, it integrates privacy-preserving KYC (ZKPs), institutional compliance, and high-speed transactions (1,400 TPS at low fees). Each account has a behavior-based reputation score, protecting users from untrustworthy members. Verified single-user accounts and Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 deliver compliant, scalable blockchain solutions for large projects. However, institutional players face a fundamental challenge: aligning blockchain's transformative promise with TradFi's relentless demand for speed and reliability. As titans like Nasdaq, CME Group, and ICE explore blockchain integration, they confront a staggering benchmark—traditional financial networks routinely process upwards of 65,000 transactions per second during peak times, a volume that would overwhelm most blockchain systems. While Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon have delivered incremental speed boosts and reduced costs, these fixes simply can't scale to meet the colossal throughput and near-instant finality demanded by modern institutional finance. This staggering performance pressure has sparked a new wave of foundational innovation. Rather than merely patching existing systems, emerging Layer 1 solutions are reengineering the blockchain's very core to tackle scalability and efficiency at an enterprise level. Among these, DevvE integrates enterprise compliance frameworks with Web2 functionality through RESTful APIs. Backed by global patents and a non-custodial instant settlement exchange, DevvE enables real-world asset tokenization with excellent scalability and lightning-fast L1 transaction speeds. Will Stewart, a veteran in global finance, recently joined DevvDigital’s Board to drive institutional adoption, reinforcing DevvE’s position as a key player in financial evolution. With scalability solutions maturing, attention has shifted to perhaps the most transformative application of blockchain in traditional finance: asset tokenization. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is blockchain’s most promising institutional use case. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and UBS are exploring tokenization, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have already run controlled pilots testing digital representations of bonds and private equity. Early security token pioneers like Polymath and Harbor proved feasibility but lacked mass adoption. Today, platforms like Securitize, tZERO, and Templum have taken the lead, effectively bridging traditional finance with blockchain. As tokenization gains traction, AI-driven compliance is emerging as a competitive edge. Rexas Finance is leveraging this approach, allowing users to tokenize a wide range of assets, from real estate to intellectual property, while ensuring automated compliance and global trading capabilities. With $45M+ raised and 47,000+ holders, Rexas provides a secure, scalable infrastructure that streamlines asset management for both institutional and retail investors. Seamless multi-chain integration enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, making asset tokenization more accessible. Moving forward, successful platforms will be those that balance blockchain’s limitless potential with institutional finance’s practical requirements. With DeFi platforms projected to reach a $100 billion valuation, the transformation isn’t theoretical—it’s happening now. While blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, its journey is fraught with significant risks. The $165 million ASX blockchain upgrade failure in 2022 starkly reminds us that even the most well-funded projects can stumble. But it's not just about failed implementations – the stakes are exponentially higher when it comes to security. Picture a smart contract flaw that could instantly freeze millions in assets or a private key breach that makes traditional password hacks look like child's play. This is why financial giants aren't rushing headlong into the blockchain future. Instead, they're adopting what insiders call a "walk-before-run" strategy: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs maintain their battle-tested legacy systems alongside blockchain pilots, while BNY Mellon is investing heavily in blockchain forensics. Their message is clear: in the race to transform finance, security isn't just another checkbox – it's the foundation upon which everything else builds. Global financial institutions are already committing billions to blockchain integration. The next phase will bring standardization, deeper integration, and hybrid financial models that blend traditional and blockchain infrastructure. By accelerating settlement speeds and eliminating inefficiencies, blockchain isn't just upgrading financial systems—it's fundamentally reimagining them for the digital age.

Monday, 17 Feb 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: A heated shouting match broke out in the Dewan Rakyat after Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal (PN-Machang) made critical remarks about Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and the royal addendum. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal accused Anwar of failing to attract investments and create high-quality jobs for Malaysians during the Parliament sitting on Monday. Citing World Bank data, he claimed that many Malaysian graduates had to work as e-hailing drivers, cashiers, and factory workers due to the lack of quality job opportunities. "Under Tambun (Anwar), Malaysia has failed to generate quality jobs. The rich are just cronies and capitalists,” he said, sparking objections from several MPs. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal also called for the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the privatisation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB), alleging that the sale of MAHB shares was linked to investment firm BlackRock. Tensions escalated further when he brought up the royal addendum related to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s house arrest. Deputy Speaker Syahredzan Johan intervened, stopping Wan Ahmad Fayhsal from continuing and referring to Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul’s previous ruling that the royal addendum could not be debated in the House. "If you're not satisfied, please submit a motion to challenge the ruling. As of now, I am not allowing it," he said, while also reminding MPs to follow proper procedures when interjecting during debates. He then issued a first warning to Wan Ahmad Fayhsal, who was previously suspended for six months in July last year, causing him to miss the last Dewan Rakyat session. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Rainmakers: Meet the 20 bankers who led last year's M&A rebound, driving billions in fees to their firms

If you were to describe dealmaking in 2024, you might say it's the year Wall Street got its swagger back. US companies announced more than $1.43 trillion in deals last year, the highest amount since 2021, when a dealmaking frenzy resulted in a record $2.51 trillion in US M&A activity, according to the deals tracker LSEG. The uptick — combined with signs of economic growth and a more relaxed approach to regulations under the Trump administration — has led some industry leaders to suggest that the M&A freeze that started in 2022 may finally be coming to an end. "There's a lot of pent-up energy in capital markets, particularly around the financial-sponsor community, and that will be unleashed," David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said at a financial industry conference in February. "I am very confident we will get back to 10-year averages" in historical dealmaking contexts, he said, adding, "This year could be one of those times." Bankers have good reason to be hopeful: There were 96 megadeals, or deals over $5 billion, announced globally last year — the most since 2021, according to LSEG. Such deals are the lifeblood of the biggest investment banks as they can generate hundreds of billions in fees for firms. Last year's M&A activity generated advisory fees of about $33.4 billion, a 7% increase from roughly $31.3 billion the year before, LSEG said. Some of the multibillion-dollar tie-ups facilitated by the battle-hardened M&A bankers on this year's list included the nearly $36 billion sale of the food manufacturer Kellanova to the snack brand Mars and the $26 billion takeover of Endeavor Energy Resources by its rival Diamondback Energy. To find out which bankers helped their firms benefit from last year's boom, Business Insider partnered with MergerLinks, a UK-based data provider that reviews M&A performance, to present the sixth annual edition of "The Rainmakers," a list of the top 20 investment bankers ranked by overall transaction volume in the US. This is the first year a woman — Anu Aiyengar of JPMorgan — has snagged the No. 1 spot. It's also the first time more than one woman has made the ranking. Aiyengar, JPMorgan's global head of mergers and acquisitions, was joined by Lily Mahdavi, who was recently promoted to cohead of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley. It's Aiyengar's fourth appearance. Other repeat names include Suhail Sikhtian, who leads Goldman's natural-resources practice; Blair Effron, a cofounder of the elite-boutique investment bank Centerview; and Stephan Feldgoise, Goldman Sachs' head of M&A. More notable, perhaps, are the unusually high number of new faces — including Mahdavi and her fellow Morgan Stanley dealmaker Steve Munger. Also new to the list are Centerview's Todd Davison, Jefferies' Conrad Gibbins, and Xavier Loriferne of JPMorgan Chase. In total, nearly 50% of the members on this year's list — nine names — are making their inaugural debut, MergerLinks said. The 2024 list also marks the first time a Jefferies banker has made the top 20. MergerLinks tracks publicly announced deals and calculates deal values on a net basis, including both equity and debt components. To make the individual league table, a banker must have been the lead advisor on either side of a transaction. Deal sizes are sourced from MergerLinks and public press releases and include the target company's net debt. The transaction values are converted from British pounds to US dollars at the average 2024 exchange rate. As a result, some deal prices announced in dollars throughout the year may not match up. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 14 Value of deals: $83.2 billion Aiyengar became JPMorgan's solo head of mergers and acquisitions in 2023 but has been with the bank since 2002. She's routinely cited as one of the financial services industry's most powerful and influential female leaders. She has appeared on the list three times in the past. Her 2024 deals included: Advised Rio Tinto, a global mining organization, its $6.7 billion acquisition of the chemicals firm Arcadium Lithium. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $78.2 billion Feldgoise was named Goldman's global head of mergers and acquisitions following a management reshuffle of its investment banking division in January. Feldgoise was previously a cohead of M&A and has also led the investment bank's consumer and retail coverage group. He joined the firm in 1997 and became a partner in 2008. This is his second time on the list, with his first appearance being two years ago. His 2024 deals included: Advised the data center firm AirTrunk in its roughly $15 billion sale to the private equity firm Blackstone. Title: CEO Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $76.2 billion Boutros is the CEO of the tech-focused investment bank Qatalyst. Previously, he was a senior banker at Credit Suisse, where he served as chairman of both the global technology and healthcare groups.

His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $74.2 billion Munger has been a Morgan Stanley banker for nearly 40 years and chairman of its M&A group for two decades. This is Munger's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director, head of FIG M&A, cohead of media & communications M&A Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $70.9 billion Loriferne joined JPMorgan in 2006. This marks Loriferne's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 4 Value of deals: $63.2 billion Davison is a partner at Centerview and has been an investment banker for more than 25 years. This is his first time appearing on the list. He joined Centerview in 2013 to cohead its media practice and was previously a cohead of North American media coverage at Morgan Stanley. Centerview says he's been involved in more than $300 billion worth of transactions throughout his career. His 2024 deals included: Title: Cohead of M&A, Americas Number of deals: 9 Value of deals: $59.6 billion Mahdavi, who has spent the entirety of her career focused on mergers and acquisitions, joined Morgan Stanley in 2012; she was previously at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She was promoted to co-lead the M&A business in the Americas in early 2025. This is Mahdavi's first time on the Rainmakers list. Her 2024 deals included: Title: Cochairman of global mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 8 Value of deals: $59.2 billion Ingrassia was previously head of Americas M&A at Goldman, a role he held since 2004. Previously, he ran the consumer retail group. He has appeared multiple times on the Rainmakers list, including last year and the year prior. His 2024 deals included: Title: Vice chairman of investment banking Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $51.3 billion This is Gallea's third time on the list. Gallea joined Goldman Sachs from JPMorgan in 2018 after spending nearly two decades there. He has distinguished himself as a leading banker in the industrials sector. His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 6 Value of deals: $49.8 billion The longtime global M&A leader moved into a new role as chairman last year so he could spend more time advising Barclays' top clients. Posternack joined the firm in 2008 after it bought Lehman Brothers, his previous firm. He led its natural-resources practice and its M&A takeover defense business. He became head of M&A worldwide in 2014. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global head of natural-resources investment banking Number of deals: 3 Value of deals: $45.9 billion Sikhtian became Goldman's sole head of natural-resources investment banking in 2020.

His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $44.5 billion This year marks Gibbins' first appearance on the list. The banker, who's based in Texas and concentrates on the energy sector, joined Jefferies as an analyst nearly 15 years ago. Since late 2022, he's served as Jefferies' cohead of Upstream in the Americas and a managing director. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global chairman, mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $43.6 billion Rajkovic joined JPMorgan from Barclays in 2011 as the head of technology mergers and acquisitions and has since risen to serve as a global chairman of M&A at the firm, led by CEO Jamie Dimon (shown above). At Barclays, Rajkovic led tech M&A as well. It's his first time on the list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Senior managing director and cohead of US investment banking Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $40.8 billion Nataraj, who has been at Evercore since 2002, is a member of the firm's management committee and a top banker in its technology, media, and telecommunications business.

He left Evercore earlier this year, taking a top role with Lazard in June. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 2 Value of deals: $35.8 billion This year marks Freudenstein's first time on the list. He joined PJT in 2017, having previously worked at JPMorgan in various roles. Those positions ranged from deputy head of Americas equity research to JPMorgan's head of market structure and asset management, and an investment banker focused on deals in the financial-services sector, before he left for PJT.

Title: ‘We were left on our own’: First-time mothers hit by shortage of public health nurses

First-time mother Siobhán Singleton had her first and only visit from a public health nurse just three days after arriving home with her bundle of joy – that was two years ago. Ms Singleton, the mother of daughter Molly, was delighted to welcome the nurse into her home, safe in the knowledge that she would see her soon again. But for Ms Singleton the security bubble of knowing frequent calls by a public health nurse to monitor her baby’s developmental stages burst when she was told she “might not” have another such visit. The service was pulled due to a lack of nurses. “We were left on our own after that, to be honest. I kept thinking we could get more visits, but we didn’t,” said the 33-year-old, who lives in the Drimnagh, Dublin 12, and is on a sabbatical from her career in paediatrics. “When I needed to weigh my daughter for some medicine when she was almost one-years-old, it became apparent that she was not meeting milestones when it came to her weight. “I contacted the local public health centre where Molly was seen and I was told she needed a referral to see a dietitian, but that they did not have a dietitian and that maybe someday she would be seen. “There were no resources made available to the centre. So we had no other option but to see a dietitian privately, which cost around €170, but we were lucky we could afford to do so.” Thankfully Molly gained weight when her calorie intake was increased. Ms Singleton said that “it’s well known that intervention if it’s needed in a child’s early months and years” was vital. “I’m totally gobsmacked by this. The service provided by public health nurses should not be allowed to be pulled like this. The safety nets are completely gone,” she said. Julie Blakeney (38), whose son Walter McEvoy Blakeney is now almost two, was delighted to have a visit from her public health nurse two days after they had left hospital. “I was so appreciative of her help and guidance, but when she was leaving I was also informed that I might not see her again. And she was right, I haven’t,” she said. “This is such a basic need that should be in place everywhere. I’ve been left to research whether Walter is meeting his milestones on my own.” But what “really annoyed” Ms Blakeney, who runs her own communications business, was a leaflet that came through her door telling her and others, also in Drimnagh, that for public health nursing services they should “scan the QR code” provided to check to see if developmental guidelines were being met. “There seems to be a real disparity of care in areas of Dublin and in the parts that really need them. Areas such as Clontarf, Glasnevin, Fairview, Blackrock or Terenure don’t seem to be affected by the lack of public health nurses. There certainly seems to be levels of inequality.” Dr Tadhg Crowley, who chairs the Irish Medical Organisation’s GP committee, said “replacing primary health nurses with non-specialist nurses or services” was not a solution and was “worrying for parents” and GPs. “At a human level, a primary healthcare nurse enters a home and sees exactly what is happening. They are another set of eyes. By stopping such a service my fear is that it will not come back to what that level was before. It is like kicking a person when they need the help of the primary health nurse the most,” he said. A HSE Dublin and Midlands spokesperson said it was “experiencing challenges in relation to the recruitment and retention” of public health nurses (PHNs) within the Greater Dublin Area. Staff shortages mean that some areas are operating what is called a “Priority 1 (P1) service as per the National Caseload Prioritisation Procedure for the PHN service”. What this means to parents and children is the HSE is now “prioritising essential services in line with immediate clinical needs and national guidelines” and “unfortunately” some services will not be provided. The HSE said those overseeing the Dublin and Midlands region were working to address service provision and said this included the development of partnerships between acute hospitals and community partners to provide graduate nurses with opportunity for a clinical rotation to the community and to initiate a similar opportunity for experienced registered nurses working within hospitals. In addition, the Department of Health has allocated 26.7 such posts with priority allocation to the three areas where there are high pressures, which include Dublin south city, Dublin west and Dublin southwest. The department said efforts were under way to fill the positions as quickly as possible. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Warrior queen meets rock’n’roll: Róisín Gartland pushes the boundaries of traditional art practices

When Kate Moss rocked up to the Dior men’s wear show in Paris recently, her hairy black coat worn over a filmy silk dress had the fashion set swooning. A similarly bushy but floor-length number sported by Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors dubbed “the full yeti” reinforced the current trend for shaggy cover-ups. In Ireland history tells us that heavy woollen capes called shaggy mantles were fashionable for centuries. Being warm, impermeable and practical, they were, in effect, raincoats and once defined Irish identity. Thousands were exported abroad until Irish dress was banned by Henry VIII. All this came to mind seeing some of the most magnificent and stylish Spanish lambskin coats, capes and curly shearling gilets made by Róisín Gartland in her Pearse Street Tower studio in Dublin, testimony to her outstanding skills and craftsmanship. Modelled here by Olwen Fouéré, the look of these outfits, complete with silver jewellery, crocodile and leather armoury, is warrior queen meets rock’n’roll. Gartland’s creativity, fuelled with diplomas and degrees in art history, fine art and sculpture, now extends well beyond virtuoso workmanship, her practice encompassing sculpture, painting, bronze casting and other materials. She is currently one of 12 people selected for pushing the boundaries of traditional practices for a European Marie Curie research project called Somas, which involves her every movement and thought being recorded and filmed as she works. The data collected will be exhibited in Cyprus later this year, “so I am starting on the road of documentation”, she says with a smile. [ Our fashion designers make waves globally, so why don’t we value their cultural contribution here?Opens in new window ] Having founded the business in 1987, with celebrity fans who included Sean Penn, Bono and Brian Friel, she closed commercial work some years ago, having decided to study fine art. “I needed to open new pathways and came back to education in my 40s and 50s because I left school very young,” she says. “Fine art was where I wanted to be because for me it’s more expansive than fashion and had the longevity that fashion didn’t have. Leather is very sculptural and comes in many forms, so I came back to it with a whole other perspective. People don’t realise that every piece must be cut by hand, so I started to see my skills as my passport. As long as I could make something that could sell, it would enable me to do everything else.” Gartland shows me the fur knife she inherited from her father, a Dublin furrier – brass with flexible blades – which like Philip Treacy’s thimble, is the tool of her trade. “I grew up from a young age watching him work at home and that is where I got the knowledge. I use it all the time and when I put it in my hand I remember myself as a little child standing on tiptoe looking at him cutting into the material and the deftness of his movements.” Leather, she explains, works in all sorts of different ways to other materials in the way it stretches. “There are areas where it stretches and areas where it doesn’t, so when I am designing I am thinking of the full potential of the material. It has a multiplicity of possibilities,” she says. She also adds that her leathers and lambskins can be washed. “The secret is to use non-bio powders. Use Woolite for wool or special products like Doterra On Guard, which uses blends of oils on a wool wash – recommended for my leggings. Just never use fabric softener,” she cautions. [ Stop using fabric softener – your clothes will be just as clean, if not even cleanerOpens in new window ] She has two studios; one in which she carries out her work, furnished with hides of all types, paper patterns, tools, machinery and worktables; the other, alongside, combines aspects of an art gallery and a shop with exhibition pieces only for display and one-off pieces that can be bought directly from her. Worth seeing are some of the dramatic outfits she created for the TG4 series on witches in 2022 – one piece, its bodice embellished with silver, was made from white Japanese leather. “We put it into an ancient Irish bog in Connemara and left it there for two years. When I took it out during Covid, it had an earthy colour, creamy beige with [what looked like] three indigo masked figures from plant material – those colours died overnight but from those images I created the stamp [of my brand] of the Triple Goddess.” Another skirt in ultra-luxurious Japanese hand-dyed indigo leather is mud spattered from being dragged along the floor in Morrigan’s Cave (known as the Cave of Cats) for the series. Pieces for sale include glossy leather jackets, shaggy pile coats and capes, gilets in supersoft Spanish merino lambskin, curly Toscana sheepskin and vegetable tanned leather. There are leggings, capes, tees, scarves and hoodies as well as smaller affordable items – functional but stylish keyrings, travel bags, cuffs and fingerless gloves. Newly arrived lambskins come in rich burgundy, brown, flame orange and black “and here I am with all these materials, and I can go anywhere with them. It’s a clean slate,” says Gartland, stroking the deep piles. What she is most enthusiastic about, however, is pirarucu, the skin of a fish native to the Amazon whose large natural scales create a unique, exotic look. “I first came across it at a show in Paris or Milan about seven or eight years ago and fell in love with it. After treatment the soft scale surface of this giant fish is like a honeycomb,” says Gartland. She has made a specially commissioned dramatic shoulder bag from it with matching leggings for the collector and curator Jobst Graeve, with whom she has collaborated on many out of the ordinary piece including a floor-length black leather cape anchored with silver. “He delights in the process, and I delight in the process”, she says of their association. Her work on a fish skin mantle was part of the European project. Fouéré, who displays these pieces with such power, describes Gartland, with whom she has worked on several projects, as “an artist who happens to work with materials and has a practice that is totally part of her. She came into my world and her contribution was extraordinary, full of magic. Her craft, her understanding of materials is deep, and her work, like embossing leather, is so painstaking. She’s like one of those people whose craft goes back to antiquity.” roisingartland.com Prices on request Stockists of Gartland’s accessories include Onyx in Blackrock, Granny’s Bottom Drawer in Kinsale and Havana, Donnybrook © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: AIL round-up: Clontarf beat Cork Con to make it tight at the top

Only one point separates the top four in Division 1A after a weekend in which, despite dropping a place to fourth, Clontarf were probably the biggest winners. Their dramatic 15-13 victory over Cork Constitution at a rain-soaked Castle Avenue completed a double over the reigning champions. Clontarf had most of the possession, territory and visits to the red zone but Con led 7-0 at the break thanks to a try by George Good. After an Aaron Coleman try for Clontarf, the visitors looked well placed to extend their eight-game winning when James Taylor’s superb penalty put them 13-5 ahead. But after a Conor Kelly penalty, Clontarf laid siege and had claims for a penalty try rejected before appearing to have butchered their last chance. However, Con opted to run down the clock off their ensuing scrum, Adam Maher fumbled on his own line and Coleman pounced for his second try. Kelly’s conversion was the last kick of the game. Clontarf can go top if they beat City of Armagh in their game in hand next Saturday. Con stayed top as Terenure’s seven-match unbeaten run ended with 31-29 loss in City of Armagh, who thus completed a double over last year’s runners-up. The home side led 24-8 early in the second half through tries by Andrew Willis, Jonny Morton and Sam Cunningham before a quick-fire double by Jordan Coghlan and Ethan Reilly made it a two-point game. After Cunningham’s second, a try by Alan Bennie earned the visitors two bonus points although they left aggrieved after the referee’s positioning of the game’s last penalty before messing up their last lineout. St Mary’s returned to winning ways with a 36-14 win over UCD at Templeville Road as tries by Daniel Leane, Mark Fogarty, Greg Jones, Richie Fahy and Leandro Ramirez earned them an unrivalled 10th attacking bonus point. Lansdowne are six points outside the top four after a 29-14 home win over Young Munster, a result that severely dents the latter’s semi-final hopes. Andy Marks set Lansdowne on their way with his 11th try of the season, and further tries by Jack Matthews, Hardus van Eeden and Juan Beukes sealed a five-point haul. On a mostly grim day for Limerick clubs Garryowen led 12-7 at half-time in Dooradoyle thanks to two tries by Ronan Quinn. But Zac Ward’s second and the boot of Conor Rankin inflicted a 13th successive loss on the home side and kept Ballynahinch’s play-off hopes alive. Old Belvedere and Instonians took big strides toward the 1B and 2A titles respectively with 13-10 and 31-12 home wins over Old Wesley and Corinthians. Trinity had an important 20-19 win over Shannon at College Park to ease fears of a second successive relegation while increasing the chances of that happening to the nine-time champions - four points adrift in 10th place and 12 behind the students. Such a fate looks inevitable for free-falling Buccaneers, whose 13th defeat in 13 games, by 42-10 at home to Old Crescent, leaves them 18 points adrift in 2A.

Title: Bitcoin ETF: Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund Discloses $437 Million BlackRock Holdings

Time Published: 2025-02-16T07:00:02Z

According to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund currently holds a significant amount in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). This purchase came in the final quarter of 2024 after asset management firm BlackRock secured the commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last November. On Friday, February 14th, a 13F filing with the SEC revealed that Mubadala Investments purchased $436.9 million of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF shares (with the ticker IBIT). Mubadala Investments is one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, which makes investments on behalf of the Middle Eastern city’s government. In 2024, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock — with tens of trillions of dollars under management — disclosed its intentions to expand in the Middle East, focusing on the capital city Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. The recent $437 million purchase of its Bitcoin ETF accentuates BlackRock’s mission to work closely with sovereign wealth funds in the region. Interestingly, this latest acquisition is hardly the first time Abu Dhabi’s government — through its various investment entities — would dabble into cryptocurrencies. In 2023, the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company and Marathon Digital revealed plans to launch digital asset mining operations in the capital city. Interestingly, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also enjoyed a fair share of domestic attention in the United States. On Friday, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board also reported an increased exposure to the premier cryptocurrency through the exchange-traded fund. According to the filing with the SEC, Wisconsin’s pension fund now holds around $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This represents an estimated 100% increase from the board’s $164 million BTC ETF holdings (previously reported in May 2024). As of the last filing, the Wisconsin pension fund held approximately 2.4 million (worth approximately $100 million) shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and 1 million shares (valued at $64 million) of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). However, the latest filing shows that the pension fund has allocated all of its BTC exposure into BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund and no longer holds any shares of GBTC. It is worth noting that the price of Bitcoin has grown by nearly 70% since May 2024. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $97,250, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is up by roughly 90% in the past year. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Business cannot thrive on radically transparent blockchains

Time Published: 2025-02-16T06:00:33Z

For millennia, businesses have relied on a careful balance of confidentiality and transparency to operate, unless we fix that balance, enterprises won’t adopt blockchains, says Matthew Niemerg of Aleph Zero. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post by Matthew Niemerg, Co-founder of Aleph Zero. In the grand halls of Florence’s Palazzo Medici, during the Renaissance, the legendary banking family conducted their affairs with an intricate dance of transparency and secrecy. While their ledgers tracked every florin with meticulous precision, access to these records was guarded as carefully as the gold in their vaults. This delicate balance between accountability and confidentiality wasn’t just good business—it was essential for survival in the complex web of Renaissance politics and commerce. Five centuries later, as blockchains are innovating both finance and business, we appear at risk of forgetting that fundamental lesson. The idea that all transactions should be permanently visible on public ledgers isn’t just naive—it’s catastrophic for business adoption. Consider a modern manufacturer negotiating with suppliers. In traditional banking, while transactions are verified and recorded, the details remain confidential—known only to the parties involved and their financial institutions. Now, imagine conducting these same negotiations on a public blockchain where every payment, every contract term, and every business relationship is visible to competitors, customers, and market manipulators. It’s equivalent to forcing businesses to publish their entire accounts payable and receivable in real-time, complete with transaction amounts and counterparty identities. Transparency should mean verifying that transactions follow agreed-upon rules, not exposing every business decision to public scrutiny. Just as Netscape’s introduction of SSL in the 1990s made e-commerce viable by securing online transactions, blockchain networks need robust privacy mechanisms to achieve mainstream business adoption. In a 2020 McKinsey survey, healthcare and financial services achieved the highest score for trust from consumers. Both industries are also two of the key adopters of blockchain. Without secure and confidential infrastructure, these sectors risk eroding the very trust they’ve spent decades building. A doctor’s prescription, a patient’s treatment plan, or a company’s financial restructuring can’t be broadcast to the world on a public ledger—no matter how secure the verification mechanism might be. The stakes are even higher today. As businesses consider moving more operations on-chain—from supply chain management to intellectual property licensing—the need for confidentiality becomes acute. A pharmaceutical company developing a breakthrough drug can’t risk exposing its research investments through transparent blockchain transactions. A retail chain shouldn’t broadcast its inventory management strategies to competitors through visible smart contracts. Moreover, the permanent nature of blockchain records amplifies privacy concerns. In traditional systems, historical transaction data eventually becomes less accessible. But on public blockchains, every transaction remains visible forever—creating an indelible record that could reveal business strategies, pricing patterns, and relationship networks to future competitors or adversaries. The solution isn’t to abandon blockchain technology’s promise of improved verification and automation. Instead, we must embed privacy into these systems from the ground up. Zero-knowledge cryptography offers a pathway, allowing transactions to be verified without revealing their contents. This technology could enable businesses to leverage blockchain’s benefits while maintaining essential confidentiality. Some blockchain purists might protest that this approach contradicts the technology’s founding principles of transparency. But they misread history. Bitcoin’s innovation wasn’t in making all transactions public—it was in solving the double-spending problem without requiring trust in a central authority. Privacy-preserving technologies can maintain this trustless verification while protecting sensitive business information. The two are not mutually exclusive. The history of banking privacy, from ancient temples to modern Swiss banks, demonstrates that confidentiality isn’t antithetical to trust—it’s essential for it. Temples’ religious role gave them a reputation for integrity and discretion. Likewise, the Medicis didn’t survive and thrive for centuries by broadcasting their clients’ financial affairs to all of Florence. They succeeded by innovating a double-entry bookkeeping system that kept client information accurate and private, ensuring trust through discretion. As we architect the future of business on blockchain networks, we must learn from this history. The next generation of blockchain protocols must incorporate privacy as a fundamental feature, not an afterthought. Zero-knowledge proofs, confidential smart contracts, and private transaction pools aren’t just technical innovations—they’re essential building blocks for practical business adoption. The stakes extend beyond individual privacy concerns to the very architecture of our future financial systems. Without robust privacy solutions, public blockchains risk pushing enterprises toward private, permissioned networks—a trend we’re already seeing. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform and the Hyperledger-based networks used by Walmart and Maersk for supply chain management demonstrate how major corporations are choosing controlled environments over public infrastructure. While these private networks serve immediate business needs, they fragment the blockchain ecosystem and limit the network effects that make public chains so powerful. Much like how corporate intranets in the early internet era eventually gave way to the public web once security measures matured, public blockchains need privacy-preserving technologies to avoid being sidelined by enterprise-specific solutions. Thankfully, this remains a limited trend, as major corporations like Ubisoft, BlackRock, and Warner Music Group continue to use public blockchains for their business use cases. However, this progress could reverse unless chains build confidentiality into their core infrastructure. The Renaissance bankers understood that privacy wasn’t about hiding misdeeds—it was about creating the trust and security necessary for commerce to flourish. As value increasingly moves onchain, we would do well to remember their wisdom.

Title: ‘I cried for two days solid’ – Keith Barry on the grief of his father’s death from lung cancer

Keith Barry Magician and entertainer Keith Barry has opened up about his experience with grief following the death of his father, who he described as “my best friend”. Ken Barry died “peacefully” last month at Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services in Blackrock, Dublin following a battle with stage four lung cancer. “He was the best dad and my best friend as well as being my dad. When he passed away it was painful,” he said, speaking on RTÉ’s Sunday with Miriam. Barry described his father as well-known, a “real gregarious character” and the life and soul of the party, who was “always the last man to bed”. His father was one of the co-founders of Tipperary Crystal, as well as Smart Telecom and featured on the Late Late Show a number of of times. He was also a judge in the Rose of Tralee for a number of years. While remembering his father as a “great man for the whole of my life”, the mentalist stressed their relationship growing up “wasn’t without strains”. Keith Barry Today's News in 90 seconds - 16th February 2025 The family, comprising of Keith, his sister Michelle, mother Kitty and father Ken, grew up on a country road in Williamstown, Waterford, living on a third of an acre, with animals, BMX bicycles and the space to enjoy all the delights of rural, country Ireland. "But when I was 15 to 18, my relationship with my dad was a bit strained. Looking back... it was probably all me, and you don't think of that at the time, but it was just probably a teenager acting out and then he reacted to that. “So it was strange for a couple of years, but then something magical happened when I was 18, 19, 20. I was in college, so I would see him every kind of weekend and ultimately our bond just really forged together,” he said. He added that his father was “my confidant, my mentor, my advisor”, who was also “one of the lads”. Up until his father’s passing last month. His father would join Barry and his friends on fishing trips. He said it was almost strange at the funeral. "My friends weren't turning up to console me, they were turning up because they had lost one of their friends in my Dad, you know,” he said. Despite not being a smoker, Barry said his father got lung cancer and was very sick for the last two years, and he and his mother ultimately became his carer. He described that period as “really difficult” as he neither he nor his father really wanted him to be his carer. "He was ready to to pass away and then when he did, ultimately, I was strong through it all. And then I cried for two days solid and that grief kind of overwhelmed me,” he said. However, two days later, that feeling “lifted” and he began to think of his father with a smile, magnifying the positive experiences they had together. “I feel guilty almost some days for not grieving more because I grieved hard and fast. I actually feel quite good at the moment. And and there's certainly a lot of guilt with that. "You wonder. Jesus, should I be crying more? Should I feel sad? I am sure that down the line it'll come back and get me,” he said. He added that the last rugby match for Ireland, was difficult, as his Dad would usually belt out the national anthem when they went to watch it together. However, although difficult to watch his father hooked up to machines in St James Hospital at the end of his life, he is glad he got to say goodbye. “I even got to ask him, ‘Dad, what kind of funeral do you want? Do you want an open casket? A closed casket?’ “That was a hard conversation to have with him and then the hard part is him telling me, ‘look after your mum, look after your sister’. It was tough. "I think it was important for him to know when he was passing. But look, I'll look after mum. She'll be fine. Me and my sister will be fine and it's OK to to pass on to wherever you think you're going,” he told his father. Non-religious, his father asked for three things: no religious service, that everyone wears bright colours and that there is a big party afterwards. “We turned up at Mount Jerome and it was a bit weird. There was a funeral in one of the buildings across from us. They were having a traditional funeral, wearing black and it was quite sombre. And then you look right next to them. “We were all in bright colours, we looked like we were going to a nightclub in Ibiza. So we honoured it,” he said. Since his father’s passing, his mother has comes to stay with Barry’s family two or three nights per week, after losing her partner of 56 years. “I think the most important thing is just surrounding yourself with positive people and people who are willing to give their time and just sit with that person and talk to them. There’s plenty of people around mum that will sit with her and just help her through this difficult time,” he said. “So yeah, look, we'll do our best and I'll be there for her as well as my wife, you know, and our two kids as well will help with the distraction.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Owning its own home pays for Fine Gael when it comes to funding elections
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/02/16/overheard-owning-its-own-home-pays-for-fine-gael-when-it-comes-to-funding-elections/

When it comes to financing elections, it pays to be a property owner, rather than a renter. Land registry records show that Fine Gael remortgaged its headquarters at 51 Upper Mount Street last September with Bank of Ireland to raise money for its election war chest. The party previously did the same thing in 2011, reportedly raising about €2.5 million ahead of that year’s general election. This time it raised €1.5 million, it said this weekend. While we have to wait for the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) to tell us how much each party spent on the recent European, local and general elections, we already know because of EU digital transparency rules that Fine Gael spent the most in the run-up to the general election with the various social-media giants. All parties and candidates spent about €870,000 combined, with Simon Harris’s party accounting for about €280,000 of the total, including more than €100,000 in the final two days of the campaign. The next highest spender was Fianna Fáil, which handed over €170,000 to Zuckerberg, Musk et al over the course of the campaign. Fianna Fáil doesn’t have a blue-chip office to remortgage to raise funds for the glut of elections we’ve had in recent months, not to mention a presidential election to come before the end of the year. In 2001 it had to sell its base of 70 years on Upper Mount Street to clear a party debt of €1 million to financial institutions. Since then it has been renting another office at 65-66 Lower Mount Street, paying “dead money” to its landlord, the National Maternity Hospital. Beneath the fake tan and tiaras, the Rose of Tralee is a hot mess – at least financially. Records released under the Freedom of Information Act show the organisers of the pageant are keeping their outfit together with the equivalent of a safety pin. Last year Anthony O’Gara, the festival’s managing director, asked Kerry County Council to secure the future of the pageant by becoming its exclusive lead sponsor. O’Gara said that every year the festival’s goodwill was “divided among competing commercial interests that have little or no connection to Kerry – our proposition is that we should change that”. The council was offered a judge on the jury, the council’s brand on the rose’s sashes and more events taking place in Kerry. But instead of becoming its lead sponsor, the council contributed only €50,000 directly to the festival last year, down from the €120,000 it has traditionally given. It spent the balance on an accompanying street carnival in Tralee, which used to be paid for by the festival. The records released show O’Gara pulled out of hosting the street festival in 2023, saying he had to focus on securing the “core elements” of the annual pageant. Also gone since 2022 is the Rose Ball, a dinner dance featuring the roses and their escorts, which O’Gara said lost more than €100,000 in its last year. In 2023 the festival lost €72,321, according to its most recent accounts, brining its total liabilities to €320,984. It’s also facing two separate legal actions by American shareholder Richard Henggeler, who wants a loan made by him to the festival to be repaid immediately. Yet O’Gara remains confident this year’s event will come up smelling of roses. This weekend he said the pageant “returned a small profit last year and we are confident that the festival will continue to flourish”. Businessman Dermot Desmond gave his blessing to plans for a new clubhouse at Wanderers FC on Merrion Road when the rugby club applied for planning permission for a swanky new two-storey pavilion with a bar, gym, changing rooms and a physio room four years ago. Desmond said the upgrade would “benefit the entire community”. “It is great to have clubs like Old Belvedere RFC and Wanderers – the second-oldest rugby club in Ireland – in such a residential area, providing excellent playing fields for senior, junior and underage teams,” he said in a letter supporting the club’s application. Dublin City Council approved the plans but the tricky conversion has been on hold since. The council asked Wanderers for a €180,000 contribution towards local infrastructure. Wanderers argued it should be exempt given it is a not-for-profit organisation. Last week An Bord Pleanála finally sided with the council, ruling that Wanderers had failed to prove it would not “accrue some profit or gain” from the enhanced facilities. If only Wanderers knew a sympathetic billionaire. Former rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Seán O’Brien, and brothers Rob and Dave Kearney have been expanding their pub empire with businessman Noel Anderson. Last year, for €5.5 million, they added McSorley’s in Ranelagh to their other Dublin watering holes: Lemon & Duke, The Bridge 1859, The Blackrock and Little Lemon. They have christened their pub chain Grand Slam Bars, sticking in a trademark for the name late last year. Unfortunately for the guys, Perry Ellis International, a clothing company that specialises in golf and tennis wear, cried foul, saying they were breaching its European trademark for the name “grand slam”. Anderson said this weekend an agreement had been reached with the company. The pub chain can use the phrase Grand Slam Bars and even sell merchandise – as long as they stick to rugby-themed clobber. Last week we reported how White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took aim at USAid funding a concert by Other Voices at the US ambassador’s residence in Ireland in 2022 called Dignity: Towards a More Equitable Future, which we mistakenly said was also funded by Rethink Ireland. Word reaches us that then Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman attended a separate event before the concert which included panel discussions on topics such as barriers to inclusion. While that event was organised by Rethink Ireland, it was funded by a €32,000 grant from the US embassy. Let’s hope it’s not on the pugnacious Leavitt’s radar. The Seanad has had its fair share of drones over the years. Now it has its first beekeeper. Fine Gael’s PJ Murphy, elected to the Seanad’s Agricultural panel, runs Ardrahan Apiary in Co Galway, which has more than 70 hives. Murphy, who is also a farmer, produces all kinds of natural honey, including soft set ivy honey made using nectar from the flowers of the ivy plant. A previous member of the Seanad, Vincent P Martin, once suggested setting up a beehive on Leinster Lawn. If it happens in this Seanad term, they have the very man for the job. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Familiar to generations living locally, Bennett’s Bakery shop on Blackrock’s main street garnered a huge amount of attention when it first came to market in 2021 with an AMV of €375,000. It had no heating of any sort, nor was there a screed of insulation. It needed rewiring, replumbing, new windows and a bathroom. Its conversion needed a knowledgeable approach. It first sold to an Irish person overseas, who then realised that the project was too large to undertake from afar, according to the selling agent DNG. The 68sq m (732sq ft) property went back on the market, and it was at this stage a retiree living on his own in a four-bedroom semi off Mount Merrion Avenue spotted it. He was looking to trade down. A building engineer, with the knowledge and experience to tackle the job, the new owner also had a bulging contacts book of talented tradesmen to execute the refurbishment. “I had considered downsizing to an apartment but couldn’t find anything nice,” he says. “It (the bakery) was so central. I knew I could get a second space in for the grandchildren to come and stay.” He was also, as he says, “looking for a bit of wow factor”. And he has found it in spades here; that is, after the serious renovation works. He paid €470,00 for the former bakery in May 2022, according to the property price register, and ploughed in about the same amount again to do it up. The Bennett’s signage remains, but the grey concrete render is gone. Its warm red brick facade is now expertly repointed. Inside, the result is a warm and toasty abode, with everything the village of Blackrock has to offer on his doorstep. He is in the heart of the action, surrounded by 34 coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cafes, according to his count, rather than being on his own in a semi in suburbia. “By making the move I have freed up a family home,” he says. The one-way glass in the front room window allows him to watch what is going on outside without being seen. [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] “Being able to look out and watch the world go by is a beautiful experience,” he says. The odd passerby, however, remains intrigued enough to literally cup their hands against the glass to try to peer in. “I think they think it’s a shop,” he says. It’s happened enough times that he is now considering putting a discreet sign up to say it is a private residence. And intriguing it is. He rejigged the layout in favour of an open-plan approach downstairs. Large format porcelain tiles are warmed by underfloor heating. He doesn’t have a Ber for the building, but says the insulation levels in the walls, floor and ceilings are high. The heating is gas, which he puts on for two hours in the morning and he doesn’t need to switch it on again. An electric flame-effect fire from Buckley’s Fireplaces brings in visual warmth. There’s a bathroom on each floor. It’s a man cave with some retiree add-ons. Marine blue is used on bespoke shelving, the window box that surrounds the triple-glazing and on the full-height cabinet doors that conceal kitchen units to the rear of the room. There’s bold floral wallpaper on two of the walls with a double height mirror wall reflecting the room into antiqued mirror-back shelving. A transparent glass spiral staircase, which feels a lot more solid underfoot than it looks, climbs up through the floors. He first spotted this design at a building exhibition. The space is youthful and fun and very much suited to his personality. He’s a ‘why not?’ kind of guy. But he’s also future-proofed it. “Being able to put a lift in was important,” he says, for he has a bad knee. [ How to plan home improvement projects to avoid delays and keep your timeline on trackOpens in new window ] So, adjacent to the stairs is a pod housing a pneumatic vacuum lift that can transport him to the principal bedroom above, and on up to the attic space on the second floor in a jiffy. It’s an innovative self-supporting structure that requires no excavation to accommodate it or the hoist way and machine room that help it function. Installation is directly on to the existing floor. In the case of a power cut, the moving car automatically descends to the lowest level. He says it cost about €50,000 to import and install and he has it serviced twice a year. While the interior is bold and contemporary, homage is paid to the property’s Victorian origins. The most obvious example is the very decorative cornice, actually three different cornices layered together, supplied by The Old Mould Company, with recessed strip lighting to the rear. It was inspired by a hotel visit. Living over the shop or in a converted shop is a way of life on mainland Europe. Here, it could help repopulate our town and village centres. This is a good thing; however, the conversion work takes time and money. This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners We need mavericks willing to spend both to demonstrate the different ways it can be done. There are lots of people willing to give it a go, but finding the pockets deep enough to execute the dream is more difficult. Would he recommend it as an option to others trading down? In a word, yes. “I was able to do it because it was my job, but for ordinary buyers you need architects and engineers, adding to costs,” he says. Fire regulations also need to be considered. “I was okay as I had a rear access.” But the upside far outweighs the difficulties. “The main benefit is location,” he says. “You’re in the heart of it once you go out your front door, with shops and restaurants all around. “This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners.” As a route to home ownership, acquiring a building that was formerly in commercial use is one that appeals to those looking for something a little different – but oftentimes, the properties need a lot of work. The key issue is access to adequate funds to purchase the property and do the work. [ Luxury apartment life above the shop in the heart of Dún Laoghaire for €675,000Opens in new window ] “The problem for home hunters hoping to buy a commercial property that you want to use for residential is that the bank won’t lend to you,” Orla McMorrow, deputy chief executive of the DNG Group, the agency that sold the bakery property, explains. “It won’t issue a residential mortgage.” As such, vendors of such properties should go for change of use planning permission before bringing the property to the market, she says. “Otherwise, you will restrict your buyer profile to cash buyers.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Late last year, Jones touted Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and poor fiscal management from the government. “I think all roads lead to inflation. I’m long gold, I’m long Bitcoin, I think commodities are so ridiculously under-owned.” The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently manages 583,122 BTC on behalf of its clients, valued at $56.86 billion at time of publishing.
