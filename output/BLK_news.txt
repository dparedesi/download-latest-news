Title: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has lost more than 30% of its value since early October, triggering a sharp shift in market psychology. What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory. Bitcoin’s short-term structure remains fragile, as shown on the 4-hour chart. Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$86,000 area represents a critical support zone. A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

Title: ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids get funding boost from Dalio and BlackRock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/trump-accounts-for-kids-get-funding-boost-from-dalio-and-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T23:25:56Z

A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. The initiative got a boost on Dec. 2 when billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion gift to seed accounts for millions of older children as well. Other big names in business and finance, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and BlackRock Inc., soon followed with smaller pledges of their own. Lawmakers significantly scaled back the flexibility and tax benefits of the program since the initial proposal. While the accounts could serve as a springboard for long-term savings, there are other investment vehicles, especially 529 plans, that offer greater tax advantages. Here’s how the accounts are supposed to work and how the new infusion of money might affect the program. For each account, annual contributions would be capped at $5,000, an amount that would be adjusted for inflation. The idea is for parents, relatives and even the employers of caregivers to pitch in money over time. The federal government, as well as state, local or tribal governments, could also contribute and aren’t subject to the cap. The accounts would be locked up until the child turns 18. At that point, Trump accounts essentially become individual retirement accounts, which can be used penalty-free for certain expenses such as higher education or first-time home purchases. Only one account is allowed per person. The US Treasury will issue regulations requiring the funds be invested in mutual or exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) that “primarily” hold US stocks. Funds must charge low fees and not use leverage, according to the law signed in July. Another exception to the contribution limit applies to nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, which could give to recipients based on where they live. Parents, relatives, employers or philanthropists can contribute to a designated recipient’s Trump account through the year they turn 17. The Internal Revenue Service has said parents will be allowed to start contributing on behalf of children starting on July 4, 2026. Also, through a pilot program, the US government would contribute $1,000 to accounts for babies born from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2028. Caregivers will be able to sign up children for an account through an online portal administered by the IRS. The commitments from corporations and well-heeled donors demonstrate how companies and business leaders are eager to demonstrate public support for a program that Trump views as part of his presidential legacy. Dalio said his foundation would donate $250 each to roughly 300,000 “Trump accounts” for children in Connecticut. BlackRock said it would match the federal government’s contributions to the accounts for employees’ children, seeding them with $1,000 each. Those pledges follow the Dells’ announcement in early December of a $6.25 billion gift aimed at seeding accounts for 25 million American children age 10 and under who were too old to be eligible for the initial government funding. The donation targets kids living in ZIP Codes with median incomes below $150,000. Each eligible account would receive $250 from the Dells. While that amount is unlikely to grow into a significant nest egg even over a couple decades, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies Inc., said when he disclosed the gift that he hoped to inspire others to give as well. Trump accounts can’t be touched until age 18. At that point, they’re essentially treated like traditional individual retirement accounts. As with IRAs, money can be withdrawn early for certain qualified expenses, including higher education, up to $10,000 toward first-time home purchases and $5,000 per child for birth or adoption expenses. Other distributions trigger a 10% penalty. The accounts grow tax-free, and wouldn’t be taxed until money is withdrawn. Those taxes are complicated, and the US Treasury hasn’t yet issued rules on how exactly they will work. The law says recipients don’t pay taxes on any post-tax contributions to their accounts, such as those from parents and relatives. But any gains or tax-free contributions from government, philanthropists or employers will be taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal. On top of that, beneficiaries would also face the 10% IRA withdrawal penalty if money is used for non-qualifying expenses. Lawmakers tweaked the Trump accounts so that distributions will be taxed as ordinary income. Early versions of the bill said distributions would be taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are much lower than those on ordinary income. The accounts also were changed so that they follow IRA withdrawal rules, meaning a recipient’s small business startup costs no longer qualify for penalty-free distributions. Trump accounts have far fewer tax benefits than 529 college savings plans, which also have far higher contribution limits. With a 529 plan, withdrawals are tax-free for qualified educational expenses, and contributions are often eligible for state income tax deductions. Trump account holders would still pay taxes on withdrawals. The Trump accounts program will cost about $15 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a tiny fraction of the overall tax and spending package approved in July. An idea for government-funded “baby bonds” was first proposed by economist Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, as a way to help poor Americans build assets and narrow the racial wealth gap. Several states, including Connecticut, have set up baby bond programs or are in the process of doing so. Hamilton has been skeptical of Trump accounts, calling them an idea to “address wealth inequality on the cheap.” One impetus for the overall approach appears to have come from Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, who along with economist Robert Shapiro last year began promoting the idea of accounts seeded with $1,000 for newborns. It’s a “simple solution to help people be connected to financial markets so everybody in the country shares in the wealth,” Hassett said at a presentation to the Aspen Institute in 2024. Greg Leiserson, an economist who served in the Biden and Obama administrations, warned “tax-preferred accounts primarily benefit families that already have spare time and money, not the families that need the most help.”

Title: Coinbase announces stock trading and new Kalshi-based prediction markets
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/coinbase-announces-stock-trading-and-new-kalshi-based-prediction-markets/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T22:30:00Z

Coinbase is taking its biggest step yet into the broader financial sector. On Wednesday, the company announced customers will now be able to trade stocks on its platform, and also place bets on a wide range of events through a partnership with prediction market startup Kalshi. The moves signal that Coinbase is moving beyond its longtime roots as a cryptocurrency company, and are likely to intensify its rivalry with fintech firms like Robinhood. The stock trading and prediction markets announcements came at a San Francisco event titled System Upgrade that featured stage presentations by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other executives, who also announced new trading features and a platform called Coinbase Business aimed at startups and small businesses. The event comes as the company is seeking to brand itself as an “everything exchange.” Notably, the company did not announce a release date for its own cryptocurrency token, which executives have teased in recent months, but without providing additional details beyond saying they want to ensure any token launch takes place in a fair manner. The new stock trading feature is the most significant announcement by far as it will be a crucial test of whether Coinbase can leverage its dominant crypto brand to expand into other sectors. It will also allow it to compete more directly with Robinhood, which made its name as a stock-trading app, but has since made significant inroads into crypto.Coinbase will initially offer only a curated list of major stocks and ETFs, but says it will expand this to thousands of other stocks in coming months. The company says stock trading will be available 24 hours a day on five days of the week, and that there will be no fee to trade. Early next year, Coinbase plans to roll out perpetual futures for stocks—a type of derivative pioneered by the crypto industry that lets traders hold options that do not expire. The perpetual futures offering will only be available outside the U.S. Coinbase’s new stock offerings come at a time when the financial market is beginning to embrace tokenization. The term describes turning a variety of assets into tokens that can be traded on a blockchain, a process that results in near-instant settlement and allows traders to more efficiently deploy collateral. Currently, firms like BlackRock are offering tokenized versions of Treasury bill and money-market funds. Tokenized stock offerings are still at a preliminary stage, but are expected to gain traction rapidly, which could play to Coinbase’s strengths given the firm’s longtime crypto expertise. For its prediction markets offering, Coinbase will source its order flow from Kalshi, which is the same model used by Robinhood. In practical terms, this entails acting as a distribution platform for the startup, which has grown exponentially this year by offering a new form of betting that invites users to wager against one another on the outcome of events ranging from elections to interest rate cuts to sports games. The Kalshi partnership will likely entail a revenue split of the small fee the platform collects on wagers. Stocks and prediction markets have the potential to offer Coinbase significant new revenue streams, and further the company’s long-stated goal of diversifying its business beyond crypto trading. Coinbase’s stock is roughly flat from the start of the year, having given up big gains in recent months as crypto markets have sagged and the price of Bitcoin has fallen around 30% from its October highs. Coinbase also used the San Francisco event to announce that its Base App is now available in 140 countries. The app, which debuted this summer, aims to let ordinary people launch financial and creative products on the company’s blockchain and earn a share of the revenue they create. Other services unveiled by Coinbase on Wednesday included expanded access to the Solana blockchain via a decentralized exchange, and an AI-powered wealth management tool called Coinbase Advisor.

Title: Ray Dalio donates $75 million to ‘Trump Accounts’ as Scott Bessent leads ‘50 State Challenge’ to invest in America’s kids

The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios’ $75 million commitment follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: Binance mulls new US strategy, CZ potentially reducing stake: Report

Time Published: 2025-12-17T18:50:29Z

Binance exited the United States in 2019, and a separate company, Binance.US, has been serving US customers since that time. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is considering a strategic reshuffling to strengthen its presence in the US market, a move that could see Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s majority stake in the company reduced. Zhao’s controlling stake in Binance has been a “major hurdle” to the company expanding to strategically critical US states, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Although no concrete plans have been announced, the conversation surrounding any potential action remains reportedly “fluid.” The company is also considering partnerships with US-based companies, including asset manager BlackRock and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to US President Donald Trump, to strengthen its footprint in the country. Rumors of Binance’s return to the US began to circulate in October after Trump pardoned Zhao, fueled by speculation from crypto industry executives and comments that Zhao made on social media. “Will do everything we can to help make America the capital of crypto and advance Web3 worldwide,” Zhao said in October after the pardon. In June 2019, Binance announced that it would stop serving US customers, and a separate company, called Binance.US and operated by BAM Trading Services, was formed to provide regulatory-compliant services to US users. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. operated both Binance.com and BAM Trading Services. Binance.US does not feature crypto derivatives or access to the global Binance exchange’s liquidity and operates as a completely separate crypto exchange. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and Binance.US but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The US is considered a key market for crypto exchanges and is ranked as the number two for global crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Expanding to the US would open up US liquidity to the world’s largest crypto exchange. Related: Binance names co-founder Yi He co-CEO alongside Richard Teng Trump’s pardon of Zhao in October drew backlash from several Democratic Party lawmakers in the US, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Waters said the pardon was a form of pay-to-play and accused Trump of doing political favors for the crypto industry that “helped line his pockets.”Warren, who is one of the most vocal critics of the crypto industry, also criticized the pardon, characterizing it as “corruption.” The comments reflect pockets of resistance among some Democratic lawmakers to the crypto industry’s continued expansion in the US and could signal potential opposition to Binance returning to the US.

Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has joined the list of billionaires backing President Donald Trump's new plan to give $1,000 to every child born in the next three years. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, and his wife, Barbara, will donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut who live in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, Dalio Philanthropies said in a press release. "Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction," Ray Dalio said in the release. "I have lived the American dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life. By providing children with savings accounts that compound over time, we are providing them with early insights into financial literacy and a path towards financial independence." BlackRock, too, announced on Wednesday that it would "offer an employee match to the US government contribution of $1,000 for all eligible US employees to Trump Accounts." Several other business leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also committed to contributing funds to the accounts of their employees' children, according to Invest America, the federal program spearheaded by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner that is now commonly known as "Trump Accounts." BNY, a financial services company, also announced last week that it would match Trump Account funds for its employees.

Since June, some of the country's wealthiest individuals have been lining up behind Trump's plan to provide a one-time, tax-free federal grant of $1,000 to every American child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The accounts will be in the child's name, but their parent will remain the sole custodian until the child turns 18. Others can contribute up to an additional $5,000 tax-free to those accounts every year. The program will officially launch on July 4, 2026. The Dalios' donation follows a substantial commitment from Michael and Susan Dell, who pledged to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million American kids — about $6.25 billion — earlier this month. The payments will be automatically deposited into the account of any child who fits the criteria and opens a Trump Account. However, not all billionaires are rushing to contribute to the Trump Accounts. The world's richest man, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, shared his thoughts on the Trump Accounts in a response on X to Ray Dalio, who had posted his praise for the program and Dells' contribution. "It is certainly a nice gesture of the Dells, but there will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income," Musk wrote. Musk once said that Tesla's Optimus robot would "eliminate poverty." Dalio Philanthropies and BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios commitment, which will total at least $75 million, follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, said ideally, governments would provide benefits that help families with children afford immediate expenses and programs like the Trump Accounts that help families save for a child’s future. “The problem that many scholars have tried to address and many politicians have tried to address with these child savings accounts is that low-income families and even middle-income families struggle to put aside money and save money for their children’s future,” said Waldfogel, who recently published a book about child benefits. Without regular government contributions targeted toward poorer families, Waldfogel does not expect the accounts to decrease economic inequality as affluent families will take advantage of them but other families will not. Steven Durlauf, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said he expects the accounts to make a very modest contribution toward the resources of young adults. His research has examined what factors impact the success of children and he said improving early childhood education and rectifying racial and economic segregation at schools and in neighborhoods would do more to give children the skills and opportunities they need to be productive. Durlauf also said as much as the philanthropy of the affluent is admirable, he thinks it should remain out of politics and controversies. “This is integrating the wealthy into the support of particular government programs that are associated with particular political figures,” he said. “And that strikes me as extraordinarily dangerous.” The Dalios have granted tens of millions to Connecticut public schools over the years, though a $100 million initiative launched in 2019 that would have involved matching public funds fell apart after state lawmakers raised questions over transparency. Altogether, the Dalios say they’ve given $7 billion through their philanthropy, which has focused on education, support for economic advancement and ocean research and education. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Share this article BlackRock deposited 74,973 Ethereum worth $220 million and 4,356 Bitcoin worth $382 million to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. The movements come amid uneven flows across BlackRock’s digital asset funds. On Tuesday, the firm’s Bitcoin ETF recorded more than $210 million in net outflows, while its Ethereum ETF saw net redemptions exceeding $220 million. Still, daily ETF flows do not necessarily capture the immediate trading behavior of the underlying assets. Instead, the flows provide insight into share creation and redemption. That said, authorized participants may choose to hold shares in inventory, wait for buyers, or redeem shares for Bitcoin at a later time. This means that inflows and outflows often lag actual market activity, and short-term daily numbers may not accurately reflect investor sentiment or trading pressure.

Title: Most Influential: Carlos Domingo

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:00:00Z

Eight years after co-founding Securitize in 2017, Carlos Domingo is steering what has quietly become one of the core infrastructure players of the tokenized asset trade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. The firm says it has about $3.6 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outstanding as of late November and expects to finish the year above $4 billion in assets under management. Securitize is profitable — revenue has grown roughly 10x over the past 18 months — and the firm is preparing to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s vehicle, with a listing targeted for early next year. “This has been the best year in the company's history, by far,” Domingo said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s been the inflection point we’d been waiting for.” If tokenization is one of crypto’s big narratives now, Domingo is quick to point out that Securitize was there when it decidedly wasn’t. “In 2021 I would talk to investors and they’d say, ‘Why would we invest in tokenization? Look at FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, they’re growing so fast,’” he said. “I’d say, ‘Sure, but are you sure those guys will be around tomorrow?’ There were a lot of red flags. Still, we were not the cool kids on the block.” It was a challenging path. Securitize had to raise fresh funding roughly every 18 months, with modest rounds compared to the mega-raises going to unregulated trading platforms. Hiring talent was harder, too. “We couldn’t give people big token packages. We couldn’t pay the highest salaries,” Domingo said. What kept him going was conviction and a bit of survivalist philosophy. “One of our board members, Brad Stephens from Blockchain Capital, told me: you need to be like a cockroach,” Domingo said. “Digitization of any industry is unavoidable, the only thing you don’t know is when. So you need to make sure you don’t die before it happens.” He’s blunt about what happened to early tokenization rivals. “If you look at the companies that looked like they were going to dominate, most disappeared, ran out of money or sold on bad terms,” he said. “Being early is a problem if you don’t survive.” Carlos Domingo will be speaking at CoinDesk's upcoming Consensus Hong Kong in February and Consensus 2026 in Miami in May. When Securitize launched, Domingo thought he was building a software company. “The original idea was to sell a tokenization platform as technology,” he recalled. Banks, asset managers and other issuers would license the stack, tokenize their assets and handle everything themselves. Securitize would just ship code. It took less than a year for reality to bite. “In 2018 it became very clear we needed to pivot from being a technology provider to being a service provider,” he said. “The people that have financial assets are not technology companies. They expect somebody to provide service to them – that’s what BNY, State Street or SS&C do.” That led Securitize to pursue licenses and roles that live deep in the plumbing of traditional finance. The firm became a registered transfer agent in the U.S., then added a broker-dealer, an alternative trading system (ATS), an investment adviser and fund administration capabilities. The transformation culminated with the acquisition of MG Stover’s unit, turning Securitize into the largest digital-asset fund administrator. Today, instead of selling a tokenization toolkit, Domingo pitches a one-stop shop to bring assets onchain. “We go to an asset manager and say: we’ll form the fund, we’ll put your securities onchain, we’ll integrate with the blockchains and DeFi, we’ll do distribution, fund admin, everything,” he said. “You do what you do well — manage assets. We do everything else.” He traces that strategy back to a dog-eared copy of “Crossing the Chasm,” Geoffrey Moore’s classic on commercializing new technologies. The core idea: early adopters are happy to stitch together multiple vendors; the mainstream market is not. “To cross the chasm, you have to offer the whole product,” Domingo said. “People are not going to piecemeal build things by putting together five different providers." The company has now moved far beyond survival, lining up a powerful roster of backers including BlackRock, Jump Crypto and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. Securitize helped bring BlackRock’s tokenized fund to market last year and has since expanded it across multiple blockchains, including Solana and BNB Chain. It’s currently the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury offering, with a roughly $2.5 billion market cap. It also lined up a powerful roster of backers Ark Invest, BlackRock and Jump Crypto. Domingo said the important shift isn’t just about putting securities on a “better ledger,” but, instead, what happens after that. The use case he emphasized is collateral. “We’re very bullish on collateral,” he said. “You can take high-quality collateral like people use in TradFi, but move it at crypto speed, 24/7, with the quality of collateral institutions expect.” Securitize has worked with venues like Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, on using tokenized RWAs as collateral in derivatives and other products. It's the kind of plumbing that doesn’t trend on social media, but it’s where Domingo sees tokenization starting to matter for the broader crypto market structure. The SPAC listing is both a milestone and a new kind of pressure. “I’m very excited about finally going public. It’s going to be a defining moment for us,” he said. “It’s also scary. I’ve never been CEO of a publicly traded company.” While Securitize’s year may look like an overnight success, from Domingo’s point of view, it’s the delayed payoff for being early and refusing to leave. “Now it’s not about whether the industry is happening or not,” he said. “It’s about how much market share we can capture and retain. We’ve been talking about this for eight years. Finally, everybody else is talking about it too.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You DAWN raises $13M to expand decentralized broadband networks The decentralized wireless protocol plans U.S. expansion and new international deployments as investors back a user-owned alternative to legacy internet providers.

Title: Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?

Time Published: 2025-12-17T14:55:34Z

Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries and macro tailwinds are challenging BTC’s traditional four-year cycle, which could result in new all-time highs in 2026. Key takeaways: ETFs, treasuries and macro tailwinds may snap Bitcoin’s four-year boom-and-bust pattern. A bearish phase should not be ruled out before new all-time highs. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in four-year cycles tied to its halving events, with prices typically peaking 12-18 months after each supply cut before sliding into a prolonged bear market. This time was no different. Bitcoin peaked near $126,200 in October, exactly eighteen months after the April 2024 halving, before declining by more than 30%. The trend aligns with the early stages of past bearish phases, prompting veteran analysts such as Peter Brandt to see Bitcoin falling toward $25,000 in the coming months. João Wedson, founder of onchain analytics company Alphractal, pointed to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal, a metric signaling the end of Bitcoin’s bull market. Historically, SOPR marked market turning points by tracking shifts between profit-taking and loss-driven selling. In bull markets, SOPR stayed above 1 as coins were sold at a profit, often preceding local tops. Near the bottom, it fell toward or below 1, signaling a realization of loss. A sustained recovery above 1 later marked easing sell pressure and past rebounds. As of December, SOPR was trending lower, showing BTC was being spent at smaller profits or at a loss. This supported the bearish narrative based on the four-year cycle. “You may believe that Bitcoin’s cycles have changed and that this time is different,” Wedson said, adding: Multiple market observers noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle may no longer be applicable, however. On Monday, US-based Grayscale Investments predicted that BTC’s price would reach a new record high in the first half of 2026, citing a growing macro demand due to currency debasement and a supportive regulatory environment in the US. “Fiat currencies (and assets denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and its potential implications for inflation over time,” Grayscale wrote in its latest report, adding: Fidelity shared a similar bullish outlook in its 2026 crypto outlook report. The investment company discussed the odds of Bitcoin entering a “supercycle,” analogous to commodity supercycles in the 2000s that spanned nearly a decade. Related: Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is intact, but driven by politics and liquidity: Analyst Central to this view is what Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital Assets’ vice president of research, called an “entirely new cohort and class of investors,” which could support a longer market expansion than in past cycles. “We’ve seen traditional money managers and investors begin to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he said, adding: As of December, US Bitcoin ETFs backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively held over 1.30 million BTC (~$114.13 billion), a 309% increase since their debut in January 2024. At the same time, public companies held over 1.08 million (~$100.42 billion) in their treasuries, an investor cohort that hardly existed before 2020. With Bitcoin miners’ role decreasing with each halving, new demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries may be altering the boom-and-bust dynamics that have historically defined Bitcoin’s four-year cycle.

Today’s top news: Two separate announcements today pointed in the same direction. Stablecoins are moving deeper into the U.S. financial system. First, Visa expanded its USDC settlement program to U.S. banks, enabling participating institutions to settle obligations using Circle’s USDC on Solana. The expansion allows banks and payment firms to move funds outside of traditional banking hours, with onchain settlement finality and integration into Visa’s existing treasury and reconciliation systems. Visa has previously tested stablecoin settlement internationally and with select partners, but this marks a broader U.S. rollout. At the same time, the FDIC approved a proposed rulemaking to implement the GENIUS Act, outlining how FDIC-supervised banks could issue payment stablecoins through subsidiaries. The proposal describes application requirements, governance standards, reserve and liquidity expectations, and ongoing supervisory oversight. Banks would be required to maintain high-quality reserves backing issued stablecoins and operate within defined risk-management and compliance frameworks. “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking about it—they’re preparing to use it” - Visa’s Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships Rubail Birwadker “Fintech and crypto innovators increasingly ask us to bring stablecoins into their existing product suite.” - Gilles Gade, founder, president, and CEO of Cross River Bank A powerful milestone in the mainstream adoption and acceptance of USDC, with Visa announcing that all US card issuers (banks, fintechs, crypto firms) can now settle directly with Visa using USDC.

Visa’s expansion shows how large payment networks are integrating stablecoins into existing systems, while the FDIC’s proposal outlines the framework banks would use to issue and manage them. The combination matters. Institutional adoption tends to accelerate once large financial intermediaries and regulators move in the same direction.

Title: Former SEC counsel explains what it takes to make RWAs compliant
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-counsel-ownership-rwa-compliant
Time Published: 2025-12-17T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
The SEC’s changing approach to crypto is supporting RWA growth, but jurisdictional and yield constraints continue to limit compliant models. The key constraint on real-world assets (RWAs) has been regulatory engagement rather than technology, and that dynamic has been shifting in the US, said Ashley Ebersole, chief legal officer of Sologenic. Ebersole joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2015, where he served in the agency’s early internal working groups on crypto and the application of securities law to blockchain-based assets. The securities regulator published the DAO Report in 2017, asserting its jurisdiction over tokens that met the definition of securities. What followed was an enforcement-led approach that left little room for sustained dialogue with the industry. “After the DAO Report, it was an enforcement response for the next two years. I expected there would be more of a rotation toward policy while I was still there — that didn’t happen,” he told Cointelegraph. Ebersole said that posture hardened after he left the agency, shortly before Gary Gensler took the helm in April 2021. From private practice, he continued engaging with the SEC until staff were later discouraged from interacting with crypto firms. The communication breakdown made it difficult for companies to design legally compliant RWA products and delayed the development of onchain securities models that are now moving into production. The market for tokenized real-world assets is scaling quickly. Standard Chartered has projected that the value of non-stablecoin RWAs could reach $2 trillion by 2028, driven largely by tokenized equities, funds and other traditional financial instruments migrating onto blockchains. Major financial institutions are positioning for that shift. BlackRock is reportedly exploring tokenization to modernize fund infrastructure, while JPMorgan has launched tokenized money-market products on Ethereum. “There is a right way to do compliant tokenization and issue tokenized assets. It absolutely can be done,” Ebersole said. Related: Ronin and ZKsync’s onchain metrics fell the most in 2025 One model he pointed to involves stock tokens that function similarly to depository receipts. When a user purchases a token, a corresponding share is acquired and held by a regulated clearing broker, while a token is minted to represent contractual rights to that share. “You own it. It’s minted at the time of purchase, and it references contractual rights to a share of stock that was purchased at the same time,” Ebersole said. Ebersole said this approach differs from other tokenized stock products that offer price exposure without conferring ownership. In those cases, stock tokens function as synthetic instruments that track the price of an equity without granting shareholder rights or a legal claim on the underlying asset. The distinction remains relevant today. In late July, Robinhood promoted tokenized exposure linked to OpenAI. The private company publicly distanced itself from the product and said that any transfer of its equity requires approval, which did not occur. Interest in tokenized RWAs is accelerating, but Ebersole warned that it does not eliminate the geographical constraints of securities regulation. In practice, many RWA initiatives run into legal and jurisdictional limits. Securities laws remain nationally bound even if blockchain infrastructure is not. An RWA structure that complies with US requirements does not automatically translate to the European Union or Asian markets, where separate licensing, disclosure and distribution rules apply. “The toughest thing we hear about with tokenized RWA projects is the maze of legal requirements that apply to these assets if you’re doing them in a fully legally compliant way,” Ebersole said. “That’s true in the US, and it’s even more complicated globally.” Related: How crypto is used in 2025: YouTube, Pokémon cards and more That fragmentation has pushed many platforms toward region-specific offerings. Robinhood’s tokenization offering is limited to EU users. It allows trading in tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded products but does not confer direct ownership of the underlying shares. Instead, the tokens mirror the prices of publicly traded securities and are regulated as blockchain-based derivatives under the bloc’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Yield is another area where RWA tokenization often runs into regulatory friction. Ebersole noted that regulators draw a sharp distinction between yield generated through a holder’s own actions — such as participating in transaction validation — and yield that accrues passively simply by holding a token. “If you buy an asset with an inherent yield just by virtue of holding it, regulators are still going to look at that as the hallmark of a security,” he said. That distinction has already shaped enforcement decisions and continues to influence how tokenized products are structured. While regulatory views on staking and other forms of yield have evolved under the current SEC administration, Ebersole said inherent yield remains a sensitive trigger under current law. The practical shift for RWAs has come from a change in how the SEC approaches the industry. During an enforcement-heavy period under the Gensler-led SEC, when staff were discouraged from engaging with crypto firms, would-be issuers were left without a workable path to build compliant onchain products, even when attempting to operate within existing securities law. That posture has begun to soften as the agency signals greater openness to engagement. Ebersole pointed to recent leadership changes at the SEC, including the arrival of Paul Atkins, as contributing to a tone that treats blockchain technology as infrastructure with potential applications for securities markets rather than as an inherent regulatory risk. “Now the SEC is engaging a lot with the industry and saying, ‘Come in and tell us if you are trying to do what we’re trying to do, how would you do it?’” Ebersole said. In that environment, compliant models such as tokenized equities structured through regulated intermediaries and custody arrangements can move from concept to production, even as legal friction persists around cross-border distribution and yield-bearing designs that can still trigger additional securities obligations. Existing securities law continues to govern RWAs, but the move away from an enforcement-only posture does not, in Ebersole’s view, foreclose the possibility of more tailored rules over time if regulators and the market continue working through remaining gaps.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the industry-owned clearing and settlement market infrastructure, has selected the privacy-focused Canton Network as a tokenization partner, the companies said on Tuesday. The partnership, which will enable a subset of U.S. Treasury securities custodied at DTC to be minted on the Canton Network, follows DTCC’s recent receipt of a No-Action Letter from the SEC to implement and operate a new service to tokenize real-world, DTC-custodied assets. The organizations are working towards an MVP in a controlled production environment during the first half of 2026, with plans to expand the project's size and scope in the months that follow, based on client interest, according to the press release. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety,” said Frank LaSalla, CEO of DTCC. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. Digital Asset, the firm behind Canton, is backed by powerful Wall Street firms including BlackRock, Blackstone, Nasdaq, S&P Global, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel Securities. In addition to the tokenization initiative, DTCC will assume a leadership position within the Canton Network’s decentralized governance structure, joining the Canton Foundation as co-chair alongside Euroclear. This new role will enable DTCC to actively participate in setting industry-wide standards for decentralized financial infrastructure, the companies said. “DTCC’s leadership in this space not only accelerates industry adoption but establishes a foundation for meaningful innovation, unlocking new liquidity opportunities, products, and operational improvements,” said Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

Why does India need a 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗶𝗹𝗹?I explained in Parliament today. pic.twitter.com/Ucw395cWpg — Raghav Chadha (@raghav_chadha) December 16, 2025 "Just as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) made digital payments inclusive in a way, similarly, to make investment and asset ownership inclusive, we will have to bring a law on tokenization in this country,” Chadha said. He noted that India’s middle class is largely confined to bank savings, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, and that tokenization could open high-return assets to them while providing instant, broker-free liquidity. Chadha said the nation now needs its own “bespoke legislation for asset tokenization” along with a dedicated regulatory sandbox to safely test new models. Such a framework, he argued, would make investment and ownership “truly inclusive for the common man,” while giving India the clarity required to attract global capital flows from hubs like Singapore, the UAE, and Hong Kong. Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that India stands at a “decisive inflection point in the evolution of global finance,” calling a dedicated tokenization bill “no longer optional… a strategic necessity to anchor India in the next financial architecture.” Such a law could unlock India-native tokenization of “infrastructure, MSMEs, real estate, carbon credits, gold, and receivables,” he noted, aligning tokenized instruments with existing securities and contract law. "Jurisdictions that provide legal clarity are rapidly becoming magnets for global capital," Kapoor said, noting that India remains, "constrained by regulatory ambiguity around tokenized assets" despite its leadership in the field of digital public infrastructure. “India needs a tokenization bill to retain economic sovereignty, ensuring Indian assets, capital formation, and innovation are tokenized onshore under Indian law, not exported to foreign jurisdictions,” he said. Without a clear statutory framework, Kapoor warned, India risks its assets, startups, and capital formation migrating offshore into friendlier jurisdictions, "often through complex SPVs that strip domestic value creation." His caution comes as global financial heavyweights are already signalling where the world is headed, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein recently writing in The Economist that finance is "entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure" driven by blockchain-based tokenization, comparing today's stage to "the internet in 1996." Musheer Ahmed, Founder and MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt that while there is skepticism around crypto assets in India, "one needs to distinguish between the asset here being a crypto asset or digital asset, which may have a variety of use cases and concerns around cross-border or money laundering." A tokenization bill would establish clear rules for financial institutions, open high-value asset participation to the middle class, and place India alongside global leaders in next-generation financial innovation, Ahmed added.

Databricks has announced plans to raise more than $4bn in a Series L funding round that values the company at $134bn. The San Francisco-based data and AI company surpassed a $4.8bn revenue run-rate during its third quarter, with year-on-year growth of more than 55%. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more The run-rate figure includes more than $1bn from its data warehousing business and more than $1bn from its AI products. The company has delivered positive free cash flow over the 12 months since December 2024. Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and JP Morgan Asset Management are leading the Series L investment. Additional investors in the round include Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, funds managed by Blackstone, Robinhood Ventures and Thrive Capital. The funding will support product development in three strategic areas: Lakebase, Databricks Apps and Agent Bricks. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The funding will be used to help customers develop AI applications and agent-based tools using their own proprietary data. The approach will position Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user-facing experience layer and Agent Bricks as the engine for multi-agent workflows. It linked this focus to what it called the parallel rise of “vibe coding” and generative AI (gen AI), which is accelerating the development of data data-intelligent applications in enterprises. Databricks Apps enables organisations to build and deploy data and AI applications quickly and securely. Agent Bricks is designed to simplify the creation and scaling of high-quality agents using an organisation’s own data. According to Databricks, Lakebase is a serverless PostgreSQL database designed specifically to support AI-era workloads. Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi stated: “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads. “With this investment, we’re deepening our commitment to help every organisation innovate with AI on their own data.” In its first six months, Lakebase has drawn thousands of customers and is generating revenue growth at twice the pace of its data warehousing product. The Data Warehousing product reached a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn in less than four years from general availability. Databricks’ AI products have achieved a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn. Its net retention rate remains above 140% and more than 700 customers are consuming at an annual revenue run-rate of more than $1m. Databricks expects the new capital to support its growth and to be used to provide liquidity for employees. The company also said the investment is expected to support future AI acquisitions and deepen its AI research.

Title: BlackRock moves 47K Ethereum in a day: But the real story isn’t a sell-off

What are institutions seeing that retail traders are missing? Even as Ethereum’s price hesitates around the $3,000 price level, the institutional engine behind the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is running at full speed. On the 16th of December, on-chain data flagged a massive $140 million transfer as BlackRock deposited 47,463 ETH into Coinbase Prime. Far from a simple “sell-off” signal, this move reflects the complex rebalancing needed to manage the leading spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF during heavy market liquidations. While retail traders hesitate, BlackRock’s major rebalancing shows strong institutional confidence, as ETF issuers must keep adjusting ETH holdings to match inflows. This strategy helps stabilize the fund during volatility and reinforces Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Though BlackRock remains the institutional “gold standard,” it is no longer the undisputed heavyweight in the Ethereum treasury race. As of mid-December, BlackRock’s ETHA fund holds approximately 3.7 million ETH (approx. $11 billion). However, this massive stash has officially been eclipsed by BitMine Immersion (BMNR). Under the leadership of Tom Lee, BitMine has aggressively expanded its treasury to nearly 4 million ETH, signaling a “MicroStrategy-style” accumulation play that prioritizes protocol-level dominance over simple ETF fee collection. The timing of BlackRock’s 47,463 ETH deposit follows a turbulent period for US-based Ethereum ETFs. On the 16th of December, Farside Investors’ data revealed a staggering net outflow of $221.3 million from BlackRock’s ETHA. This single-day redemption accounted for nearly 99% of the total $224.2 million pulled from all US Ethereum ETFs combined. All in all, this suggests that while the “institutional machinery” is moving funds on-chain, it is largely to facilitate heavy redemptions from investors who are rotating capital or de-risking amidst a lackluster Q4 performance for the asset. That being said, this institutional reshuffling occurred against a backdrop of technical fragility. At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $2,935.44. Despite a microscopic 0.77% gain in a 24-hour window, the broader trend remains bearish with ETH plummeting by 11.58% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap Hence, for BlackRock, the challenge is now two-fold: managing the logistics of massive ETF outflows while simultaneously defending a price floor that retail traders seem increasingly unwilling to support. This coincided with BlackRock’s recent $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum, which the broader market has largely misread as mere price speculation. In reality, this move signalled BlackRock’s formal validation of Ethereum not as a “digital gold” alternative to Bitcoin, but as the essential financial infrastructure of the future. By securing this bundle of ETH, the world’s largest asset manager is effectively stockpiling the “fuel” necessary to run its BUIDL fund, which operates exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, this acquisition shows BlackRock is no longer just participating in crypto, but actively building on Ethereum as mission-critical infrastructure for future global finance.

Title: Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of "translator" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns. This skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology. When it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The "virtual investment analyst" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June. It leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes. Now, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.

At first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists "sits at the horizontal" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research. She found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar. When she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, "but they've got no idea what it means," she told Business Insider. Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an "AI native," and added that her team is at the "tip of the spear" when it comes to applying AI to investment. Craig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams. "I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research," she said of her work. Craig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success. "If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle," she said. For Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is "a huge honor." Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site. Craig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics. "If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact," Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists "lean in." For Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock. When it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing. As she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far. "We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles," she said. "Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6." Jump to

Title: Solana Foundation Outlines Plans To Combat Emerging Quantum Computing Risks

Time Published: 2025-12-17T09:00:41Z

As concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency landscape grow, the Solana Foundation has taken new measures by announcing a collaboration with Project Eleven, which specializes in post-quantum security. In a Tuesday press release, the Solana Foundation outlined its commitment to fortifying the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem against the implications of quantum computing. Through this initiative, Project Eleven has conducted a comprehensive threat assessment and successfully prototyped a functioning testnet utilizing post-quantum digital signatures. Under their engagement, Project Eleven undertook a risk analysis to evaluate how forthcoming breakthroughs in quantum computing could impact various facets of Solana’s infrastructure. Areas scrutinized included user wallets, validator security, and the foundational cryptographic assumptions that underpin the network. Moreover, Project Eleven has implemented a working post-quantum signature system on a Solana testnet, demonstrating that quantum-resistant transactions can be both practical and scalable. Matt Sorg, VP of Technology at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the organization’s approach: “Our responsibility is to ensure Solana remains secure not just today, but decades into the future.” He noted that the culture of innovation within the Solana ecosystem would continue to thrive with the upcoming release of a second client and an advanced consensus mechanism this year. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Solana didn’t wait for quantum computers to become a headline problem. They invested early, asked the hard questions, and took actionable steps today.” Solana’s stance comes amid alarming reports indicating that quantum computers could potentially undermine blockchain security by developing algorithms capable of deciphering private keys. This scenario raises significant concerns for any digital assets operating on blockchain technology that rely on digital signatures, making them vulnerable to quantum hacking. As such, industry experts are actively exploring various measures to bolster cryptocurrency networks against these threats. Doug Finke, Chief Content Officer at Global Quantum Intelligence, pointed out that several groups are integrating the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms established by NIST into their platforms. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might be developed, raising the stakes even further. Finke stated, “What’s worse, if an unfriendly party does develop such a computer, they may not let anyone know about it.” Currently, several cryptocurrencies have already begun incorporating quantum-safe cryptography into their architecture, including Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Cellframe, and Bitcoin Quantum from BTQ. Among those issuing warnings about the looming threats from quantum computing are notable figures such as Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, Capriole Investment founder Charles Edwards, and representatives from major firms like BlackRock and Google. Yakovenko has urged the Bitcoin community to accelerate efforts to implement quantum-resistant upgrades. He believes there is a 50% chance of a significant quantum breakthrough occurring within the next five years, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $127, which is a 6.7% decrease in price over the past seven days. Compared to the all-time high of $293 reached earlier this year, SOL is trading at almost 56% below this threshold.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Another $277 Million Outflow with Long-Term Holders Selling

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $277 million in net outflows on December 16, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, as total ETF AUM fell sharply over the past two months. Amid the strong Bitcoin BTC $85 180 24h volatility: 0.9% Market cap: $1.70 T Vol. 24h: $58.43 B price correction, spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have surged simultaneously, clocking another $277 million on Dec. 16. This surge in outflows, along with the sell-off from long-term holders, highlights the waning institutional sentiment. BTC price is currently around $86,500 as analysts brace for further volatility ahead of the US CPI, and BoJ rate hike decisions this week. On Tuesday, Dec. 16, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for the second consecutive day at $277 million. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the most outflows at $210 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB at $50 million as per Farside Investors data. Fidelity’s FBTC was the only Bitcoin fund to see positive inflows at $26.7 million, while the rest others saw zero or negative flows. As per the on-chain data, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) dumped a total of 2.405 BTC yesterday. However, the trading activity remains elevated with $2.8 billion in total volumes. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF trading: Source: Trader T Moreover, the net assets under management (AUM) across all Bitcoin ETFs saw a sharp drop from $169.5 billion to $120.7 billion over the past 60 days. November alone saw net outflows totaling $3.79 billion, reported market analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera. He added that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, accounted for a significant portion of the decline, recording approximately $2.7 billion in redemptions over a five-week period. The sustained outflows suggest strong institutional selling pressure in the market. On-chain data shows that long-term holders (LTH) of Bitcoin are locking in gains, while selling on every rise. According to data from CryptoQuant, the recent sell-off from LTHs over the past 30 days is one of the largest in the last five years. It added that selling by this cohort has historically occurred closer to market highs rather than during price bottoms. Current data shows long-term holder supply declining from record levels, while Bitcoin continues to trade well above the LTH realized price. This shows that the recent selling reflects profit-taking behavior instead of any panic-driven capitulation. Market experts like Peter Brandt expect an 80% Bitcoin crash from the highs. Bitcoin long-term holder selloff | Source: CryptoQuant All eyes will be on the macro events such as the release of US CPI data and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. The Bank of Japan is expected to raise its policy rate to 0.75%, making it the country’s highest interest rate level since 1995. Each of the Bank of Japan’s previous rate hikes has coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin, with past drawdowns ranging between 23% and 31%.

Title: SPYM’s $100B Milestone Might Be the Last of Its Kind

The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com A hundred billion is the new hundred million. State Street’s SPYM fund surpassed $100 billion in assets last week, making it the fastest to grow from $50 billion to $100 billion, taking just 283 trading days, according to State Street. The ETF is the latest entrant to the core S&P 500 cast and represents the firm’s efforts to access growing retail markets via low fees; SPYM’s is just two basis points. But it may be the last core S&P 500 product breakthrough for a while because of all the funds already tracking the index — and their sheer size. This means advisors shouldn’t expect any new core S&P 500 funds anytime soon, experts said. “It’s more likely that other kinds of broad equity ETFs will be launched in the future as opposed to [trying to] do battle with $100 billion ETFs that are out there,” said Loren Fox, director of research at Fuse Research Network. “At this point, it’s hard to see a lot of space in the market for another S&P 500 ETF that is just tracking the straight beta.” SPYM, which formerly operated under the ticker SPLG, is one of the four primary S&P 500 ETF offerings, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. The others include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). But they cater to different segments of the market: While SPY has traditionally been a fund for institutions, such as asset managers and hedge funds, IVV has honed in on advised retail and VOO on self-directed retail investors. Because of State Street’s institutional focus, added Ullal, the company didn’t really have a product that prioritized the retail segment. “SPYM basically is their way of accessing retail money, by going with a lower-cost product and competing more directly with VOO and IVV,” he said. Inflows and outflows among the rest of the four were varied. In Q3 2025: S Tier. The ETF industry as a whole, Ullal said, can also be broken down into three main price segments: the passively managed, low-cost beta tier; the mid-priced segment, which has more active management; and high-priced funds of roughly 75 basis points and above, including things like derivatives and buffer products. “The newer entrants, like Capital Group, JPMorgan [and] Goldman Sachs, they’re focused more on active management, derivatives and those kinds of products,” Ullal said. But the low-cost segment, he added, is dominated by the likes of Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — something he doesn’t see changing: “It’s hard to see anybody coming and disrupting these three big players.” With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Court to reconsider inquest into death of infant born at Bessborough mother and baby home

Cork South Coroner’s Court will reconsider holding an inquest into the death of a baby boy shortly after his birth at Bessborough mother and baby home, after the court’s chief coroner conceded a High Court challenge brought by the infant’s mother. Madeleine Bridget Marvier was 17-years-old when she was admitted to the home in Blackrock, Cork city, in August 1960. About two months later, she gave birth to her son, William Gerard Walsh. In December 1960, at 37 days old, William died at St Finbarr’s Hospital, Cork. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. This request was refused. Ms Marvier brought judicial review proceedings against the Cork South Coroner in July challenging the refusal, claiming that a conclusion that the infant’s death is beyond doubt “cannot reasonably be drawn or inferred” and is “without basis” in the evidence she had put before the coroner. Ms Marvier brought the case alongside her daughter, Carmel Cantwell. On Tuesday, barrister Cillian Bracken, appearing for Ms Marvier, told Mr Justice Micheál O’Higgins that an order could be made on consent quashing the coroner’s decision to refuse to hold an inquest into the infant’s death. Mr Bracken said an order could also be made remitting the case to the deputy coroner for Cork South for reconsideration. An order against the coroner for his clients’ legal costs could also be made, counsel said. Barrister Eoin Sreenan, appearing for the coroner, said his client was consenting to the reliefs. Mr Justice O’Higgins granted the orders. Bessborough mother and baby home was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, an order of nuns, between 1922 and 1998. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded that 923 babies associated with Bessborough died during that time, but burial records for only 64 of them could be found. According to Ms Marvier’s court documents, her son’s death certificate – which she obtained in 1999 – attributed his death to renal abscess septicaemia, sepsis caused by an abscess in the kidney. Ms Marvier said she was previously unaware of the cause attributed to her son’s death. In 2019, after obtaining documents from Tusla, Ms Marvier learned for the first time that William had been buried at Carr’s Hill Cemetery in Cork, within the jurisdiction of the Cork South Coroner. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. Included in her request was a report compiled by Dr Michael Munro, a consultant neonatologist, who opined that the death certificate’s stated cause of death was speculative and conjectural. In January this year, the coroner wrote to Ms Marvier refusing the request to hold an inquest. The coroner stated William did not die in a violent or unnatural manner, and on the balance of probabilities, did not die unexpectedly or from unknown causes, Ms Marvier’s court papers stated. Ms Marvier’s case noted the coroner’s purported assumption that in the absence of any record of a postmortem examination of the infant, there was no doubt around the cause of death of the infant, and therefore, there was no sufficient evidence available now to cast doubt on the death certificate’s cause of death. Ms Marvier claimed that the coroner made this assumption while at the same time acknowledging that medical records pertaining to the infant’s care at St Finbarr’s are now unavailable, and that it was not known what medical skills were employed in establishing William’s cause of death.

Title: JP Morgan’s move to Ethereum proves Wall Street is quietly hijacking the digital dollar from crypto natives

JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JP Morgan Chase & Co. has formally entered the contest for on-chain cash, and the prize is not just a new product line. It is the billions of dollars in institutional capital that now sit in zero-yield stablecoins and early tokenized funds. On Dec. 15, the $4 trillion banking giant launched the My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) on the Ethereum blockchain, in its attempt to pull back liquidity into a structure it controls and regulators recognize. MONY wraps a traditional money-market fund in a token that can live on public rails, pairing the speed of crypto with the one feature payment stablecoins such as Tether and Circle cannot legally offer under new US rules: yield. That makes MONY less a DeFi experiment than JP Morgan’s attempt to redefine what “cash on-chain” means for large, KYC’d pools of capital. It also puts the bank in more direct competition with BlackRock’s BUIDL and the broader tokenized Treasuries sector, which has grown into a mid–tens of billions market as institutions look for yield-bearing, blockchain-native cash equivalents. To understand the timing, one has to start with the GENIUS Act, the US stablecoin law passed earlier this year. The statute created a full licensing regime for payment stablecoins and, crucially, banned issuers from paying interest to token holders simply for holding the token. As a result, the core business model for regulated dollar stablecoins is now codified: issuers hold reserves in safe assets, collect the yield, and pass none of it through directly. For corporate treasurers and crypto funds that hold large stablecoin balances for weeks or months, that embeds a structural opportunity cost. In a world where front-end rates hover in the mid-single digits, that “stablecoin tax” can run at roughly 4–5% per year on idle balances. MONY is designed to sit outside that perimeter. It is structured as a Rule 506(c) private placement money-market fund, not a payment stablecoin. That means it is treated as a security, sold only to accredited investors, and invested in US Treasuries and fully collateralized Treasury repos. As a money fund, it is structured to pass most of the underlying income back to shareholders after fees, not to trap the entire yield at the issuer level. Crypto research firm Asva Capital noted: “Tokenized money-market funds solve a key problem: idle stablecoins earning zero yield.” By letting qualified investors subscribe and redeem in either cash or USDC via JP Morgan’s Morgan Money platform, MONY effectively creates a two-step workflow. This allows the investors to use USDC or other payment tokens for transactions, then rotate into MONY when the priority shifts to holding and earning. For JP Morgan, this is not a side bet. The bank seeded MONY with around $100 million of its own capital and is marketing it directly into its global liquidity client base. As John Donohue, head of Global Liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management, put it, the firm expects other global systemically important banks to follow. So, the message is that tokenization has progressed past pilots; it is now a delivery mechanism for core cash products. The economic logic becomes clearer when you look at collateral, not wallets. Crypto derivatives markets, prime brokerage platforms and OTC desks require margin and collateral around the clock. Historically, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have been the default because they are fast and broadly accepted. They are not, however, capital efficient in a high-rate regime. Tokenized money funds are built to fill that gap. Instead of parking $100 million in stablecoins that earn nothing, a fund or trading desk can hold $100 million of MMF tokens that track a conservative portfolio of short-term government assets and still move at blockchain speed between vetted venues. BlackRock’s BUIDL product has already shown how that can evolve. Once it gained acceptance as collateral on large exchanges’ institutional rails, it stopped being “tokenization as demo” and became part of the funding stack. MONY is aimed at the same corridor, but with a different perimeter. While BUIDL has pushed aggressively into crypto-native platforms through partnerships with tokenization specialists, JP Morgan is tying MONY tightly to its own Kinexys Digital Assets stack and the existing Morgan Money distribution network. So, the pitch for MONY is not to the offshore, high-frequency trading crowd. It is to pensions, insurers, asset managers and corporates that already use money-market funds and JP Morgan’s liquidity platforms today. Donohue has argued that tokenization can “fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions.” In practical terms, that means shrinking settlement windows for collateral moves from T+1 into intraday, and doing it without moving out of the banking and fund-regulation perimeter. Moreover, the risk for stablecoins is not that they disappear. It is that a meaningful slice of the large, institutional balances that currently sit in USDC or USDT for collateral and treasury purposes migrate into tokenized MMFs instead, leaving stablecoins more concentrated in payments and open DeFi. Perhaps the clearest signal in MONY’s design is the choice of Ethereum as its base chain. JP Morgan has run private ledgers and permissioned networks for years; putting a flagship cash product on a public blockchain is an acknowledgment that liquidity, tooling and counterparties have converged there. Thomas Lee of BitMine views the move as a watershed moment, stating simply that “Ethereum is the future of finance.” This is a claim now supported by the fact that the world’s largest bank is deploying its flagship tokenized cash product on the network. However, the “public” blockchain launch here comes with an asterisk. MONY is still a 506(c) security. This means that its tokens can only sit in allowlisted, KYC’d wallets, and transfers are controlled to comply with securities law and the fund’s own restrictions. That effectively splits on-chain dollar instruments into two overlapping layers. On the permissionless layer, retail users, high-frequency traders and DeFi protocols will continue to rely on Tether, USDC and similar tokens. Their value proposition is censorship resistance, universal composability and ubiquity across protocols and chains. On the permissioned layer, MONY and peer funds like BUIDL and Goldman’s and BNY Mellon’s tokenized MMFs offer regulated, yield-bearing cash equivalents to institutions that care more about audit trails, governance and counterparty risk than about permissionless composability. Their liquidity is thinner but more curated; their use cases are narrower but higher-value per dollar. Considering this, JP Morgan is betting that the next meaningful wave of on-chain volume will come from that second group: treasurers who want Ethereum’s speed and integration without taking on the regulatory ambiguity that still surrounds a large part of DeFi. Ultimately, MONY looks less like a revolution against the existing system and more like a defensive pivot inside it. For a decade, fintech and crypto firms chipped away at banks’ payment, FX and custody businesses. Stablecoins then went after the most fundamental layer: deposits and cash management, offering a digital bearer-like alternative that could sit outside bank balance sheets entirely. By launching a tokenized money-market fund on public rails, JP Morgan is trying to pull some of that migration back inside its own perimeter, even if it means cannibalizing parts of its traditional deposit base. George Gatch, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has emphasized “active management and innovation” as the core of the offering, implicitly contrasting it with the passive float-skimming model of stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, bank is not alone. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have already moved into tokenized MMFs and tokenized cash-equivalent products. So, JP Morgan’s entry shifts that trend from early experimentation to open competition among incumbents over who will own institutional “digital dollars” on public chains. If that competition succeeds, the effect will not be the end of stablecoins or the triumph of DeFi. Instead, it would be a quiet re-bundling as the settlement rails will be public, and the instruments running on them will look a lot like traditional money-market funds. However, the institutions earning a spread on the world’s cash will, once again, be the same Wall Street names that dominated the pre-tokenization era. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The holidays came early for five BlackRock employees, who joined an elite circle of some of the firm's most accomplished technologists on Tuesday. They became members of BlackRock's Tech Fellows program, a group of 24 senior technologists playing a crucial role in the $13.5 trillion firm's vision and operations. This year's members underwent a rigorous application process — from being nominated to completing written evaluations and interviews — before being voted into the program by current fellows, Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and executive sponsor of AI, and the co-executive sponsor of the program, said. "We think about the combination of technical expertise, domain expertise, commercial mindset, but really lifting the platform, the culture, the experience across the firm," said Ajitsaria, who has been involved with Tech Fellows since it launched in 2020. Many of this year's fellows are credited with mentoring other technologists, according to an internal announcement shared with Business Insider. Technologists are gaining more and more influence on Wall Street as firms race to adopt AI. BlackRock has long positioned itself as equal parts financial technology company and asset manager. Aladdin — the firm's sprawling risk and portfolio management platform — underpins its client relationships, and tech-related revenue is among its fastest-growing businesses. BlackRock's technology services and subscription revenue jumped 28% year-on-year over the last quarter, fueled by Aladdin and the integration of newly acquired Preqin's private-markets data business, the firm reported in its latest earnings.

Four of this year's fellows work in Aladdin, though Ajitsaria said that the group has always represented a wide swath of the firm's businesses. "We are also really deliberate about leveraging and applying our tech fellows to the firm's most critical technology initiatives," Ajitsaria said. As of 2023, one in every third BlackRock employee was a software engineer or technologist, according to a document about the firm. Fellows meet internally at least once a month and are expected to foster the firm's engineering culture both internally and externally — they might, for example, contribute to BlackRock's engineering blog or attend conferences, Ajitsaria said. BlackRock has set high targets for the year 2030, when it aims to reach $35 billion in annual revenue and fundraising $400 billion in private markets. As Ajitsaria said, "the 2030 vision of BlackRock is very much underpinned by technology." These five new fellows have just become a more integral part of that vision. As the head of Aladdin Studio Engineering for Aladdin Data, David Woodhead has spearheaded the effort to "open Aladdin," giving stakeholders access to the platform's data and analytics models, among other tools. He's recognized for "championing modern data platforms, cloud-native technologies, and open-source adoption," according to the internal announcement. Woodhead has helped craft the very architecture of Aladdin. Beyond his role at Aladdin Studio, Woodhead also oversees services that give Aladdin and its clients reference, market, and other third-party data. He joined BlackRock in 2006 and is based in Virginia, serving as a managing director. Kirsty Craig has been at BlackRock for 15 years and now serves as the head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech. She's shaped how the firm uses AI and data science in investment research. While Craig is this year's only fellow who doesn't work within the Aladdin program, she has forged collaboration between the investment and technology teams. Craig has worked in offices in Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia, and is currently a managing director. New York-based director Infant Vasanth is known for his work pushing BlackRock's internal research and automation platform forward. He joined the firm in 2011 and is now a senior director of engineering, running the team behind an analytics and automation platform. Vasanth, an advocate for open-source, often speaks at tech conferences and is the brain behind multiple patent filings. He also leads a team focused on Aladdin Studio's AI abilities. "Drawing on deep expertise in neural networks and pattern-recognition algorithms, he applies research rigor to building enterprise-scale AI systems," the announcement said. Michael Duncan, a director and engineering lead on Aladdin's Trading Engineering team, is the architect behind a collection of tools dubbed BlackRock's Xceler Ecosystem, which is now integral across Aladdin and has helped raise engineering standards. His team is in charge of "delivering multi-asset trading solutions and technology across global markets," and Duncan has improved its abilities. Beyond that, Duncan is the global engineering lead for part of Aladdin and leads a client support and performance engineering program. Duncan joined BlackRock in 2020 and is based in Chicago. New York-based Charlie Johnston joined BlackRock as a summer intern in 2013 and has worked his way up to being a director. A software engineer, he has improved the quality of the asset management giant's code and development processes. "Charlie's technical contributions and collaborative approach have strengthened the engineering community across Aladdin," the internal announcement reads. Jump to

Title: Altcoins update: XRP ETFs hit $1B in inflows; whales offload Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/altcoins-update-xrp-etfs-hit-1b-in-inflows-whales-offload-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T15:48:14Z

Cryptocurrencies extended their weakness on Tuesday, with Bitcoin sliding toward $85K. The value of all digital assets has declined by 3% over the past day to $2.96 trillion. Sentiments are deteriorating daily due to thin liquidity, as even fundamentally healthy projects are failing to sustain prolonged upsides. Amidst the gloomy outlook, investors are becoming more defensive, with institutional players reducing exposure as they rotate to narratives dominating the current landscape. This divergence is visible in leading altcoins, XRP and Ethereum, in this case. Let us explore further. Ripple’s token is recording a rare enterprise win amid broad market declines. According to SoSoValue data, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds have hot $1 billion in cumulative inflows. That marks a crucial milestone for a product that launched on November 13. Notably, XRP ETFs have recorded consistent daily inflows since their debut. The substantial inflows, within a short timeframe, indicate that expert investors are narrowing their focus and not exiting crypto altogether. XRP’s compliant ETF structure makes it appealing for institutions seeking cryptocurrency exposure without handling operational risks or custody. Most importantly, the inflows suggest a long-term positioning strategy, rather than chasing near-term price fluctuations. XRP’s institutional attractiveness lies in its improved regulatory clarity and clear use cases. Narratives matter the most during bearish sessions. Indeed, traditional investors will justify a payment-focused blockchain ecosystem faster than highly speculative or experimental narratives. Moreover, ETFs are crucial for enterprises looking to manage risk as they offer transparency, compliance, and liquidity. These features are valuable during unstable markets and have helped XRP-related products absorb pressure as rivals endure outflows. Meanwhile, XRP is trading at $1.92 after losing 7% the previous week. While the XRP community cheered staggering inflows, Ethereum is encountering immense selling pressure as large-scale holders reduce their exposure. According to Lookonchain, BlackRock has deposited 47,463 ETH, valued at approximately $140 million, to Coinbase Prime. Markets have interpreted the transaction as a preparation to sell. At the same time, the Konstantin Lomashuk-linked wallet sold 14,585 tokens, worth roughly $42.71 million, today, when ETH changed hands at $2,928. Also, Lookonchain revealed two whales that dumped Ethereum worth around $40.82 million, 14,000 tokens early today. The magnitude and timing of these transfers have intensified bearish sentiments around the largest altcoin. These transactions coincide with an already fragile market, amplifying downward momentum for ETH prices. Ethereum is trading at $2,928 after losing 3% and 6% the past day and week.

Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it? Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products. Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts. Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. “The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers. “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement. The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Visa launches USDC settlement for US banks on Solana blockchain

Visa launched USDC settlement for US financial institutions, starting with Cross River and Lead Bank on Solana, with a wider rollout planned for 2026. Payment processing giant Visa has launched USDC settlement services for some United States-based financial institutions. Visa said Tuesday that its USDC (USDC) settlement service is available for US financial institutions, with Cross River Bank and Lead Bank as the first participants; they have already begun settling with Visa in USDC on the Solana blockchain, and a broader rollout is expected in 2026. The report follows USDC issuer Circle’s launch of the public testnet for its layer-1 blockchain Arc, with over 100 major partners, including Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, in late October. Visa noted that it is a design partner for the network, which “offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa’s global commercial activity.” Visa said it plans to use Arc for USDC settlements within its network and operate a network node. The payment giant’s global head of growth products and strategic partnerships, Rubail Birwadker, said “financial institutions are looking for faster, programmable settlement options that integrate seamlessly with their existing treasury operations.” Visa said the US launch is part of a larger effort to modernize its settlement infrastructure. Birwadker’s comments suggest that adopting stablecoins is a way for the company to ensure it remains relevant when stablecoins gain a more substantial foothold. He said, “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because [its] banking partners are not only asking about it — they’re preparing to use it.” Visa appears to be taking an active role in helping financial institutions adopt stablecoins for their operations. On Monday, the company launched a global Stablecoins Advisory Practice, a unit tasked explicitly with helping banks, merchants and fintechs design, roll out and manage stablecoin products. Related: YouTube enables PYUSD stablecoin payouts for US creators: Report On Nov. 27, Visa announced it had expanded its use of stablecoins for settlement in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa by partnering with crypto infrastructure company Aquanow. The partnership aims “to settle transactions using approved stablecoins such as USDC, reducing costs, operational friction, and settlement times.” Visa cited strong demand from banks and payment companies as the reason behind the initiative. Still, not all Visa stablecoin products are institution-facing services. On Nov. 12, Visa launched a pilot in the US, allowing US dollar-pegged stablecoin payouts to user wallets to be sent from business accounts funded using fiat currency. Visa said it is in the process of onboarding “select partners,” and broader access to the service will be rolled out in 2026.

Business FILE PHOTO: Databricks logo is seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Dec 16 : Databricks said on Tuesday that it has raised more than $4 billion at a valuation of $134 billion, the latest example of investors betting big on companies benefiting from the broader adoption of artificial intelligence. The Series L funding round for Databricks, which provides a software platform that helps firms manage large amounts of data and build their own AI models, came less than six months after its previous round at a valuation of $100 billion. It has given the San Francisco-based company a war chest to maintain investment momentum against competitors. "It's a race, and everybody's investing," Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview.
