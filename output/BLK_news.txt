Bitcoin’s $8B decline signals potential for a rebound, but macro challenges and bears remain in control. Macro headwinds are starting to weigh on the market. FUD is picking up, demand is clearly slowing, and bears are beginning to find their footing. Bitcoin [BTC] hasn’t established a reliable support base yet, and with long positions stacked up, the risk of a liquidation cascade is real. Still, the market feels like it’s on a knife’s edge. One decisive move from the bulls could flip the momentum fast. The next move likely defines the short-term trend. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s daily chart. You’ll see five straight red candles lighting up the board. On the 27th of May, BTC briefly touched $110K, then bears crashed the party hard, triggering a swift sell-off that squeezed the bulls tight. But the catch is, this liquidity surge followed Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury buy. Normally, that’d fuel a pump, but instead, traders hit the brakes, dialing up the risk-off mood. The culprit? Trade war jitters. As AMBCrypto pointed out, retail cash is fleeing back to safe havens like bonds, draining momentum from crypto. And it’s not just retail. Amid the U.S. equity slowdown, institutional capital is stepping back, too. BlackRock sold 4,100 BTC, snapping its 52-day streak of consecutive inflows. Source: Farside Investors Bears are flexing. In fact, Funding Rates on Bybit turned red for the first time in almost a month, adding to the downside pressure with the macro scene looking shaky. But here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s been dropping in a straight line – no crazy swings, no solid support yet, no bounce back. So what’s brewing? A full-blown distribution dump or just a tight liquidity squeeze ready to snap back? Putting macro noise and futures flows aside, a single sell-off won’t flip the script to distribution just yet. In fact, on the 29th of May, at $105,521, spot wallets saw an outflow of 8,175 BTC – signaling serious accumulation, not panic selling. On the derivatives front, as AMBCrypto flagged, on the 23rd of May, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) hit a record $80 billion, lining up with its all-time price high. What followed? A sharp round of deleveraging. At press time, Bitcoin’s OI slid to $71.86 billion. That’s a staggering $8 billion flush in just seven days. Source: CoinGlass That explains Bitcoin’s controlled, linear bleed. But without signs of capitulation from weak or strong hands, the bulls still have a window to strike back. So far, this looks less like panic and more like the board getting reset, ready for a healthier leg, once the macro clouds clear.

Title: Adani Energy to raise $502 million through stake sale

(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. approved raising 43 billion rupees ($502 million) via a stake sale. The Adani Group unit’s board approved a proposal to raise the amount via “Qualified Institutional Placement” in one or more tranches, according to an exchange filing Saturday. Adani companies, with interests stretching from ports to green energy, are steadily regaining investor confidence after a US indictment of the founder soured sentiment. The group in April raised about $750 million for an acquisition, with BlackRock Inc. subscribing to about a third of the bond issue. Last week, its ports unit raised $150 million from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in a bilateral loan. In March, Fitch Ratings removed Adani Energy from a rating watch and assigned it a negative outlook, citing moderating risks associated with the group’s liquidity. “The Adani group has demonstrated adequate funding access” since the US bribery charges, Fitch said in a statement.

Title: Letters: Michael McDowell is wrong about RTÉ being infiltrated by ‘Stalinists’ at the height of the IRA’s war against the Irish people

Time Published: 2025-06-01T01:30:00Z
Full Content:
Senator Michael McDowell. Photo: Gerry Mooney Madam — In last week’s Sunday Independent (May 25) senator Michael McDowell took a sideswipe at those of us who worked in RTÉ current affairs at the height of the Provisional IRA’s war against the Irish people. In doing so he distorted the historical record and recycled the hairy old conspiracy theory that RTÉ had been “infiltrated” by The Workers Party activists who held the station’s current affairs coverage in a “vice-like grip”. I was one of the “Stalinists” senator McDowell was getting at in his interview with Dónal Lynch. For the record, I wasn’t “infiltrated” into RTÉ in 1978 but was offered the post of producer/director after a rigorous open public competition. I joined the current affairs programme Today Tonight in 1980 and was part of a large editorial team who robustly debated how to cover the biggest story of the day: the Provisional republican movement’s attempt to take power in Ireland, North and south, through “the ballot box and the Armalite”. Like the majority of my producer and researcher colleagues in RTÉ at the time I supported the ban on Provo and loyalist frontmen appearing on air to justify their terror campaigns. In backing Section 31, I and others like me in RTÉ, believed we were acting in defence of Irish democracy against an evil sectarian insurgency that sought to plunge the island of Ireland into a full scale ethnic civil war. In Dáil Éireann Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats all embraced this point of view. Workers Party TDs took the opposite view and voted in support of the arguments advanced by purist advocates of free speech and most RTÉ journalists. Their contention was that the apologists for murder would be held to account by tough forensic journalism. That never happened. In 1994 the ban on Sinn Féin appearing on RTÉ was lifted. At that time the Provos had no TDs sitting in Dáil Éireann. Thirty years later, despite being unrepentant about the war crimes of its military wing, Sinn Féin has 39 TDs, one more than Fine Gael. Like senator McDowell I regard the Provisional IRA campaign that Sinn Féin justifies as an “abomination”. That murderous Provisional “abomination” was at its most lethal in the 1970s and 80s. I am proud to state that I was one of many RTÉ programme makers who saw the slaughter perpetrated on behalf of “Irish freedom” by Provo “volunteers” for what it was, and called it out when it was most needed. Gerry Gregg, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — In years to come, a global generation of young people will confront their parents with two simple questions. What did you do to oppose the catastrophic genocide of innocent civilians in Gaza and what did you do to resist the deliberately induced famine? The very least we should be able to answer is that we demanded of our TDs an immediate implementation of the Occupied Territories Bill. A piece of legislation which in and of itself is a totally inadequate response to the incremental displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank and yet consecutive Irish governments have found multiple excuses to not apply even this deficient response. If we do not mobilise as a national collective to demand our representatives act on Israeli genocide, we, too, will have to bear the guilt of the morally outraged, yet at the same time otherwise engaged citizen. Kevin McCarthy, Killaloe, Co Clare Madam — I read the article last week, ‘Doctor sees nine of her 10 children killed in new IDF atrocity’, and wondered why it wasn’t on the front page. These awful atrocities by Israel continue and our national news is more interested in what new disrespectful, bully-boy tactics have been dreamed up by Trump, giving him priority. What has happened in the world where poor children can just be killed by a powerful and rich nation, cheered on by the USA (a country I used to respect), while the rest of the world seems afraid to show our total disgust. The bad will continue to wreak havoc uncontested if the good remain silent. I am proud that Ireland is vocal in its condemnation of Israel, but the media needs to give it more priority. Less prominent pages of newspapers can be reserved for Trump news. Siobhán Buckley, Mallow, Co Cork Madam — Letter writers last week wrote about the suffering of children in Gaza and accused Israel of genocide. No mention that the current war began when Hamas perpetrated the highest number of murders of Jews in one day since the Holocaust. If the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was genocide then the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany would have been genocide, too. Ciarán Masterson, Cathedral Road, Cavan Madam — John Boyne writes that he came out as gay to unequivocal family support. Many of us were not so lucky. He also says he was too afraid to attend Pride as a teenager. Many of us attend Pride, and campaign for our community, in spite of or even because of that fear. If all he can do at a time of rising anti-LGBTQ+ hate across the world is sit on the sidelines and throw barbs at a community he has never needed or aided, that might go some way to explain why our community doesn’t need or heed him now. Jess Connor, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Madam — In his recent article, John Boyne argued for the repeal of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2015, referring to it as “problematic at best, and deeply misogynistic at worst”. Yet he offers no explanation as to what these problems might be. The issue of gender recognition has been thoroughly examined by the Irish courts and the Dáil since Dr Lydia Foy’s case began in 1997. To scrap this legislation would make Irish law incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Boyne mentions “fear of being attacked” as a teenager. Yet repealing the GRA (the mechanism by which trans people can update documents to match their gender, presentation and appearance) would force trans people to out themselves constantly. We face the same hatred, from the same people, but Mr Boyne refuses to empathise with us. He would prefer to split our community based on our differences, rather than unite under our shared struggle. Ciara Witts, Birr, Co Offaly Madam — John Boyne’s column reads like a lengthy exercise in privilege, positioning himself as a spokesperson for a “respectable” gay minority. His account of coming out to unequivocal family support, a string of relationships, and public success is not just his personal experience — it’s a profoundly atypical one. His suggestion that Pride is no longer necessary because his life is comfortable reveals a breathtaking detachment from the daily realities still faced by many LGBTQ+ people. Pride was not built for those who never needed it. Boyne’s attempt to distance himself from LGBTQ+ culture does not make him brave or insightful. It makes him condescending. To imply that queer students are just “ruthlessly straight middle-class” dilettantes, or that trans women pose a threat to women’s rights, is scapegoating — fear dressed as reason. He praises the Cass Review as if it were universally respected, failing to acknowledge the flaws that have prompted criticism from within the medical and academic communities. What Boyne dismisses as hollow allyship — being told he is “loved, seen and heard” — is, in fact, empathy. His rejection of it says more about his own discomfort than the intentions of allies. Empathy, not elitism, is what underpins meaningful progress. Caz Koopman, Cobh, Co Cork Madam — I wish to compliment John Boyne on his brave, balanced, honest and insightful article about being gay. He sums it up very well when he says, “it is just the way I was born”. I agree. Dr Pat Mc Grath, Monkstown, Co Dublin Madam — It is wonderful to read John Boyne’s clear and refreshing refutation of our modern “Pride” celebration and the LGBTQ+ label. At a time when Pride flags are draped year round outside secondary schools and youth centres, we have to wonder what confusing ideology is being promoted to our youth in the guise of compassion and inclusion. The pendulum has swung too far and clear thinking and maturity is needed from the leaders of our community. Boyne is clearly showing leadership here and I hope our educators listen. Alan Coakey, Roscommon town Madam — As someone who has visited the United States many times, it saddens me that I will probably never go there again. Trump’s recent intention to have the social media accounts of visa applicants looked at is not only creepy, but scary. To me it is the last straw. This is going to cause widespread damage to the plans of students in Ireland who go to America every summer to work on a J1 visa. And after he is gone, his legacy will still linger as the much younger and even more right-wing JD Vance, the vice president who has publicly let it be known that he dislikes foreigners immensely, especially Europeans, will carry on Trump’s catastrophic policy of ripping America’s reputation to bits. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Madam — I want to congratulate Nikki Hayes for being so candid with Niamh Horan in last week’s Sunday Independent. I was stuck by the veracity of Nikki’s story and I want to take this opportunity to wish this brave woman every good wish for the future. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — As an Irish pro-choice, pro-gay marriage feminist, I was delighted to read in the Sunday Independent that the commencement of the Government’s recently enacted surrogacy legislation has been paused and that a reconsideration is taking place. It is simply not the case that only conservative people oppose this legislation. There are very many liberal feminists in Ireland who oppose surrogacy because they want and work towards the best possible life for women and girls and this does not include having babies for anyone other than themselves. Anne Weadick, Galway city Madam — How timely was Niall MacMonagle’s interview with artist Michael Kane. Niall interviewed the artist before the opening of his exhibition in the Taylor Galleries. Michael died the day after. This particular interview captured the essence of the artist and this particular column is to be treasured because it captures the essence of the man. Niall is a superb interpreter of the art world and we could do with more words and more space from this columnist. Phyl Herbert, Rathmines, Dublin 6 Madam — Your restaurant critic’s review is my “go-to” page in Life magazine. It is always enjoyable. Last week, Lucinda asked: “Could this be the first 3-star?” This being Chapter One restaurant in Dublin and the 3-star being the elusive Michelin award. She supports her suggestion by telling us that, at the recent RAI awards, Chapter One, a Michelin 2-star restaurant, took the gong for the best restaurant in Dublin. I have no doubt that this is truly deserved. However, at the very same awards ceremony, Dede in Baltimore, also a Michelin 2-star restaurant, not only took the gong for the best restaurant in Ireland, but, as it happened, retained the gong won in 2024 for the best restaurant in Ireland. I would respectfully suggest that the Michelin Man should be more inclined, if and when they give the 3 stars, to look at the best in Ireland, rather than the best in Dublin — even if it is in West Cork, rather than in the capital. Michael Kenefick, Whitegate, Co Cork Madam — Gabija Gataveckaite and Mary Regan’s timely piece recently highlighted growing coalition unease over James Browne’s performance as Housing Minister. It’s hard not to ask: why didn’t Simon Harris, as FG leader, take the role himself? With housing in crisis, it would have been a clear signal of leadership. Instead, he chose Foreign Affairs and Defence. As Shane Ross noted recently, Ireland is acting like “a small country with a swollen head”. With record homelessness and housing starts at a four-year low, Harris’s decision speaks volumes. When the house is on fire, he is out installing satellite dishes. A housing tsar might yet be appointed, but we needed a political heavyweight months ago. Dylan Redmond, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — In response to a letter writer who pined for a more charismatic and youthful president of the United States, I wrote a letter to your newspaper with “Boring Joe Biden is doing just fine. He doesn’t have to leave his basement to get votes and instead concentrates on policy and enacting legislation”. Your predecessor edited those words to “Boring old Joe Biden” and gave me €50. Reading Shane Ross’s article last week, ‘Politics is a vocation where vanity captures its victims — I should know’, I’m reminded of that ageist sentence. Joe Biden was boring but by any standard he was one of the most successful bipartisan legislators of the past 50 years in US politics. What he was not good for though was selling newspapers or advertisements on cable TV. And therein lies the problem in the English-speaking western media. The 46th US president may still have lost to Donald Trump had he resisted the pile-on from the media and others to step down, but his record in government will stand the test of time. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry Madam — If mass is the scientific term for the quantity of matter in a given object, and Mass is the ceremony that celebrates the sacrament of the eucharist, might it be a good idea to differentiate the two by using lowercase and uppercase? Mary Lally, Clontarf, Dublin 3 Madam — Having watched Uncharted on RTÉ, may I compliment the real heroes, the camera crew and the back-up team who took serious risks to get the daring footage. Well done also to Ray Goggins and the other amazing participants on their bravery.

Buckle up, folks. You’ll have a lot of words coming your way, but they’re the good kind of words. The ones with nothing but earnest intentions, that want to help people, not hurt them. While Refused are more know for their overbearing aural sounds, they’re aiming to contribute a bit more to society. A global society that needs it for sure. Now that the band is approaching the upcoming start of the European leg of their farewell tour, they’ve got a plan that involves them raising hella money to donate to pro-Palestinian causes across the land. Besides it being the right thing to do, their decision came after finding out information about some of the festivals they’re scheduled to play, and who might be financially backing those festivals. They call out KKR specifically, saying how they “invest in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things.” Read the band’s lengthy but explanatory statement and action plan below: “So a week ago we found out that some of the festivals we’re playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe.

In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant.

Title: Is Ethereum Preparing For A Move To $3,800? Analysts Predict Bullish Phase Ahead
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-ethereum-preparing-for-a-move-to-3800-analysts-predict-bullish-phase-ahead/
Time Published: 2025-05-31T09:30:40Z
Full Content:
Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH’s ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH’s bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan’s outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it’s outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH’s recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH’s bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

IRISH RAIL HAS announced that its services between Dublin’s Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable this weekend as commuters flock to a series of bank holiday events. Between today and Monday, 2 June, restrictions and alterations will apply to both rail and bus services because of limited capacity due to annual summer gatherings such as the Bloom festival and the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon taking place. Here are the main changes to note across the primary public transport services. A revised timetable will be in place for the weekend, with Monday’s times operating as Sunday schedules for Dart and commuter services. Dart services between Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable due to major works on the line between Connolly and Blackrock which will also impact Rosslare Intercity services. However, rail tickets on affected routes are valid on Dublin Bus. Dart services are operating between Malahide/Howth and Connolly, and between Dún Laoghaire and Bray/Greystones. All other rail services are also off between Connolly and Dún Laoghaire for the entire bank holiday weekend, and Rosslare services will be operating from Bray only. (You can find full details here). Advertisement Irish Rail is reminding customers to pre-book tickets to ensure a seat on intercity trains because of high demand on Heuston-bound rail for the purpose of attending the Bord Bia Bloom festival in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. Some Dublin-bound trains from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are already fully booked, so additional trains will operate out of Cork and Galway to accommodate passenger numbers heading to Bloom Extra early trains from Cobh, Midleton and Mallow will be laid on to provide for high numbers attending the Cork City Marathon on Sunday.

Title: Dublin is ridiculous. Here's why I still love it

You hear stories about how people survive in this impossibly expensive city. Couples who stay in loveless relationships because they can’t afford to separate. Strangers from Facebook groups sleeping in the same room. A bed rented by one person in the day and a different person at night. Tenants paying their landlords with sex. Artists squatting illegally in their studios. People sleeping in storage units. These stories are full of human ingenuity and degradation. They’re really quite strange when you think about them properly. The strangest part is how common they’ve become. [ Ireland’s rising rents: ‘Our budget would have been €1,300 a month, there isn’t even anything listed for that’Opens in new window ] About a year ago, my best friend in Dublin moved to Berlin, where he says it’s still possible to be broke and live well. When he left his damp, windowless room near Connolly Station – which cost just under a thousand euros a month – there were people queuing for the privilege of being next. Now he lives in a sunlit attic for a fraction of the price, and drinks Fritz Colas and Berliner Pilsners on the rooftop. Every so often, during our calls, he tries to convince me to join him. His logic is hard to fault: Dublin is untenable. Unless you have private wealth or can stomach a corporate job, you resign yourself to chronic financial dread – the kind that squats over your life like Fuseli’s goblin in the painting. At least in other expensive cities, such as New York or London, you can escape your overpriced room into a pulsing metropolis, with endless distractions and some of them free. In Dublin, all you can really do is go to the pub, and even that costs too much. The city is very small, and it seems to constrict as the years pass. You can’t leave the house without seeing a face you know. In fact, there are no faces you don’t know. They approach from all sides. And the rain. The constant rain. I recognise the truth in this, and it’s hard to argue with. Why would anyone choose to live in such a ridiculous city? I don’t know if I really understand my own reasons for staying. I suspect they’re quite shameful: they have more to do with a romantic or aesthetic impulse than with anything practical. I just like Dublin. I like the harsh beaches and the Martello towers. The silvery, rinsed-out light. I like walking through the sprawling industrial wastelands on the city’s fringes. I like the canals in spring, all fragrant with weeds and strewn with sunk bicycles. Strangers here seem to want to tell you things – like the old lady who, for no discernible reason, wanted to talk about the time she heard Bob Marley singing Redemption Song at Dalymount Park. You witness things. Once, on Talbot Street, I saw a man with an arm in a cast get into a physical fight with a man on crutches. I like Dublin on the rare occasions when it snows. I like the hot, malty smell from the Guinness factory. I like the Liberties, where you can hear the quiet rush of subterranean rivers, and church bells, and horses’ hooves. I like that ugly statue of Oscar Wilde with the pervert’s smile. I even like the loud, sentimental music on Grafton Street, and the whiskey-soaked ballads streaming from the pubs in Temple Bar. The idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here ... we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener Mainly, though, I like Dublin because I chose it. The first time I visited, I was 21. I had some half-baked but very attractive notion of what Ireland represented: something to do with resistance, with migration and nostalgia and alcoholism. I had a copy of Finnegans Wake and I think I got about three pages in on the bus ride into town before falling asleep. When I woke up, I scrambled off and left the book behind. I had oysters for lunch that day and pictured my whole life in the city. It felt just the right size to make mine. I’ve lived in bigger cities: Barcelona, where I grew up, and London, where I lived before coming here; and smaller, random places: Brighton, Siena. I’ve spoken to quite a few Dubliners who are desperate to move to other European cities and can’t understand my decision to stay. There’s a kind of faith involved in choosing a city. You respond to its atmosphere, its pace and texture, the way it opens up to you – or doesn’t. Dublin, for all its flaws, felt like it might yield something if I stayed long enough. The beginning in a new place is always the hardest part: slow, bitty, full of doubts. I didn’t know anyone. I’d been accepted into a master’s programme but couldn’t fund it and had to defer my place by a year. When my sublet ended, I had to return to London for a while because I couldn’t find another room. I worked in bars and signed up with a temp agency that sent me on scattershot catering shifts around the city. The jobs were mostly tedious, but they offered a kind of education. I learned how the different bits of the city fit together, like a giant jigsaw. The glassy conference rooms down by the Quays. The Leopardstown racecourse, where West End men come on weekends to get extravagantly drunk. The grand Georgian hotels and restaurants, where they throw out so much good food it makes you want to cry. The methadone clinic at the end of the bus line where you hear the wildest conversations and sometimes get drawn in. [ Dublin: The 13th best city in the world ... supposedlyOpens in new window ] It occurs to me that the difficulty of establishing yourself in a city confers a special kind of meaning on your relationship to it. Like in a toxic romance, if you can weather the lows, the highs are incredible. Who knows – maybe the expensiveness and impossibility of a place like Dublin, far from being deterrents, actually deepen its appeal, the way we fetishise designer handbags but never their identical fakes. I’ve always had this wrong-headed idea that the value of something is revealed by the sting of its attendant sacrifice. Gradually, my life in Dublin took on more solidity. I was lucky enough to receive a university grant. I met people. I signed a lease. I moved in with a friend and we painted all the walls fresh white. She bought velvet floral curtains in pastel colours and hung them in the livingroom. I found a few prints in charity shops. I got a Persian carpet from a lady in Blackrock Market. A friend gave me a desk she no longer needed. Sometimes the city sends you little signs of progress. The quiet, stoical man in the corner shop at the end of my road has started calling me “honey”, and occasionally smiles. I have a friend’s spare keys on my keyring. I know the name of my neighbour’s dog. I know which cobbler to go to for the best deal. Still, there are days when I fantasise about leaving. It would be nice to buy lunch in a cafe without feeling frivolous. It would be wonderful not to feel like I’m stuck in a recurring nightmare every time rent comes around. Oddly, the idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here. Maybe that’s no coincidence. To return to the toxic romance analogy: we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener. Recently, I spoke to a friend in London who’s moving to Iowa City for a master of fine arts degree. He told me he’s spent hours on Google Maps, exploring the place through Street View. The images all seem to have been captured on sunny days – it looks green and beautiful, full of classic American wood-frame houses. He’s begun to associate the town with Iowa Dream by Arthur Russell, all melodic guitar lines and soft lyrics. The self he pictured living there was different from the one he knows in London: less anxious, more social, content to spend long afternoons drifting around and hanging out with friends. [ Trevor White: I love Dublin. But there’s no point in pretending it’s a great small cityOpens in new window ] I also indulge in this kind of cartographic dreaming. I explore prospective cities on Street View: Beirut, Paris, Berlin. It’s a surreal activity. You pick a spot on the map and drag yourself along, imagining a parallel life. Sometimes, from one click to the next, the sun disappears and rain slicks the tarmac. Figures with blurred faces vanish or are replaced by others in different clothes further down the road. You realise the map is stitched together from footage taken on different days, in different moods. Another thing my friend hinted at stayed with me: that emigration can be indistinguishable from escapism. When I imagine myself in another city, I don’t picture myself as I am now, but a physically and intellectually tweaked version. In Paris, I’m gaunt with a perfect bob; I smoke straights and read Lacan for pleasure. In Beirut, I am somehow fluent in Arabic; I drink less; I am sharper and more spiritual. I study ancient manuscripts. In Berlin, I am reunited with my best friend and we live together like Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith before it all fell apart, looking cool and making great art. The fantasy isn’t really about the new city. It’s about becoming a new person. [ Emer McLysaght: Five lessons Dublin can learn from ZurichOpens in new window ] There’s a way of reading this that feels a little bleak. You could say it reflects a kind of ambient self-disgust, or an inability to accept life as it is. A symptom of being stuck in the wheel of samsara: trapped in a cycle of craving and disappointment, forever projecting some improved self just over the horizon, never quite admitting that the old self follows you everywhere. There’s truth in that, but it’s not the whole story. There’s another, more generous way to see it. Maybe it isn’t escapism, but a kind of unconscious recognition that we are always in the process of becoming. Cities aren’t just stages on which our lives play out. They are the biggest collaborators. They shape how we speak, how we move, how we think. They alter our trajectories. When you choose to stay in a place, you’re submitting to its influence. To live in a city is to enter into a kind of contract. You agree to spend your time, your energy, and your labour in its service. In return, it promises transformation, but on its own terms. Like the enchanted gift in a fairy tale, the city will change you in ways you can’t predict, and not all of them will be kind. The point is you don’t get to choose. It’s a gamble. Is it one worth taking? Ruby Eastwood is a writer living in Dublin © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Financials Shift from ‘Green’ Agenda to Greenbacks

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj In a slow but steady retreat, the world’s most powerful financial institutions are abandoning their once-lauded climate pledges in the beginning of a long-overdue correction. From BlackRock’s quiet exit to the mass defection of U.S. banking giants, the climate bandwagon is losing passengers. And what replaces it could finally bring a necessary focus on real-world developmental finance for both Western economies and the Global South. In 2024, the U.S. banking sector staged a collective retreat from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). Exiting the alliance were six of America’s largest banks – Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Their reasons: legal and fiduciary concerns, coupled with mounting pressure from Republican-led states accusing the banks of violating antitrust laws by coordinating climate policies that could limit the financing of fossil fuel enterprises. Wells Fargo went further, explicitly dropping its pledge to achieve “net-zero” and stating it would instead “meet clients where they are in their chosen energy and transition strategies.” HSBC diluted its 2050 goals, acknowledging the impracticality of abrupt decarbonization. In January, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager with approximately $11.5 trillion under management – left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. BlackRock’s exit was a body blow to Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the U.N.-backed coalition launched in 2021 to align institutions with decarbonization goals. These reversals coincided with Trump-era policy shifts: rescinding clean energy subsidies, green-lighting fossil fuels and prioritizing energy security. Republican-led lawsuits, such as the one filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, alleged that climate-focused investment strategies suppress industries like coal. These political headwinds have made finance executives wary of aligning with the likes of GFANZ On April 29, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) quietly abandoned its $500 billion commitment to decarbonization efforts. The reason? Canada’s updated Competition Act now treats exaggerated environmental claims as potential greenwashing – a criminal offense. The delicious irony is that this announcement came just one day after Mark Carney – former U.N. climate finance czar and a founder of GFANZ – was elected Prime Minister of Canada. Carney’s GFANZ, launched at COP26, boasted 450 firms managing $130 trillion. Today, it’s a ghost town. RBC’s exit epitomizes the alliance’s collapse. GFANZ demanded banks phase out fossil fuels. Instead, banks phased out GFANZ. RBC said the new legal framework made it “infeasible” to quantify progress on the goal without risking regulatory breaches. The entire edifice of net-zero commitments – built on ambiguous projections and unverifiable metrics – has begun to collapse under the weight of the laws meant to enforce them. Crying “betrayal,” critics of banks and asset managers departing climate coalitions lament a “backward slide.” But how could regulating atmospheric CO₂ reasonably be the job of your neighborhood bank? Wall Street was never meant to be an environmental regulator. It is supposed to allocate capital where it generates value. And the green agenda, riddled with faulty science, speculative technologies and political overreach, simply does not qualify as valuable. The green exodus has exposed the folly of policymakers at the U.N. and other global institutions that coerced financial giants into a quixotic crusade bereft of rationality. The world’s big banks have handed nearly $7 trillion in funding to the fossil fuel industry since 2016, the year when the Paris Agreement was formed to decapitate fossil fuel expansion. Critics decried this as an abandonment of climate goals, but for 2.2 billion households globally, it meant affordable energy and economic stability. The exit from climate politics heralds a crucial return to prioritizing genuine economic development. Sluggishness in many Western economies is, in part, a consequence of misallocation by climate hysteria. Some have questioned whether this shift is permanent, noting the powerful political forces that have driven the climate industrial complex may be disinclined to surrender. However, there is no doubt that to the extent financial institutions unshackle themselves from impractical climate pledges, they can refocus on supporting innovation, infrastructure and industries that generate real growth and jobs. This commentary was first published at RealClearEnergy on May 28, 2025. Vijay Jayaraj is a Science and Research Associate at the CO₂ Coalition, Arlington, Virginia. He holds an M.S. in environmental sciences from the University of East Anglia and a postgraduate degree in energy management from Robert Gordon University, both in the U.K., and a bachelor’s in engineering from Anna University, India.

The people that Reeves is most likely to target https://inews.co.uk/news/tax-rises-reeves-most-likely-target-3718040 Yes. A whole lotta evidence-free speculation. I would bet they’ll just borrow the shortfalls, and leave it as a problem for the next government. UK’s Government borrowed £150,000 million in the 12 months to the end of April 2025. So they – and their predecessor, the Useless Tories – are already borrowing substantially. Interest is the 12 months to end March 2025 was £109,000 million, so they’re already borrowing to pay the interest. Borrowing to pay the interest bill rarely ends well. . . . Auto 150,000 million = 150,000,000,000,000. That is 150 trillion and does not seem right. A thousand million is a billion, and a million million is a trillion. Therefore 150,000 million is 150 billion. 150,000 million does not equal 150,000,000,000,000. This is the lawsuit being formed against them. https://app.screencast.com/ZMpNTvkLD7DDJ Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense. https://app.screencast.com/DFd1viHxsRjq7 Countless investors were defrauded into funding this political agenda. In conclusion, a clear message emerges from our analysis: those who viewed responsible investing as the definitive solution to address sustainability issues in the corporate world may need to reconsider. While responsible investing has clear merits and can lead to positive impacts, our research highlights the importance of scrutiny and regulation to disentangle true sustainability from greenwashing. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/smoke-and-mirrors-look-inside-esg-fund-portfolios Wall Street Firms deliberately ignored the political risks of these investments. https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/chris-wright-department-of-energy-carbon-capture/2025/05/30/id/1213033/ None of these Green Industries were self sustaining and yet Wall Street poured billions of other people’s money into them. “Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense.” First I’d have to imagine a judge that was listening. If they have a talent it would be figuring out what I’m going to say in the next 2 hours during the first 2 minutes. ‘They’ really believed they could entice/force people off the living standard cliff to bankrupt Capitalism. They bought the media and drove it into the ground with lies and thought they could sustain the lies and people wouldn’t care their lives were upended and deteriorating. Now their media is unbelievable and worthless. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of Marxists. It’s good to see the big banks and investment institutions coming to their senses by realizing their clients are concerned primarily with steady returns. As long as the money isn’t being used to finance the sex trade, recreational drug production, and illegal arms smuggling, they don’t want to see it being used to prop up fashionable social and environmental issues like supposedly fighting the mythical climate crisis. And when they’re informed that despite billions in subsidies for renewable energy initiatives, fossil fuels still provide 82% of the world’s primary energy, they realize that using their investment proceeds to prop up wind and solar is a classic case of backing the wrong horse. In the situation with Mark Carney, he knew the only way to win the recent Canadian election was to dump the much-reviled carbon tax that was just increasing living costs while having an almost-imperceptible impact on reducing national emissions. Ah yes, it looks like the plutes are finally drifting away from climate madness, and following Marcus Aurelius’s advice: “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.” Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Update font size. Reset Before President Donald Trump’s recent Middle East trip, the White House invited CEOs and representatives from numerous U.S. companies to accompany him. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, chose not to attend, according to two sources familiar with the matter. This decision seemed to irritate President Trump. During his visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, he made several remarks critical of Mr. Cook and Apple. Tripp Mickle for The New York Times: ‎ During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs… Nu Wexler, principal at Four Corners Public Affairs and a former Washington policy communications executive at Google and Facebook, said Mr. Cook’s “very public relationship” with Mr. Trump has backfired. “It has put Apple at a disadvantage because every move, including a potential concession from Trump, is scrutinized,” Mr. Wexler said. Because Mr. Trump didn’t “have much incentive to either go easy on Apple or cut a deal on tariffs,” he said, “the incentive to crack down is much stronger.” The timing of the White House’s new tariff plan couldn’t be worse for Mr. Cook, who has led Apple for nearly 14 years. Last month, the company suffered a stinging defeat in an App Store trial. The judge in the trial rebuked Apple executives, saying they had “outright lied under oath” and that “Cook chose poorly,” and ruled that Apple had to change how it operates the App Store. Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief designer who became estranged from Mr. Cook and left the company in 2019, joined OpenAI last week to build a potential iPhone competitor. Its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, released in January 2024 to fanfare, has been a disappointment. And in March, Apple postponed its promised release of a new Siri, raising fresh doubts about its ability to compete in the industry’s race to adopt artificial intelligence. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple needed a new CEO at least a decade ago. Instead, the endless iteration parade continues, with each year’s entries now unveiled via canned videos, growing ever more tiresome, diffused with ever more vapor, as each new paradigm shift is blindly missed by an aging, boring-as-beige CEO surrounded by burnt-out, surfeited VPs. We’ve long been the canaries in the coal mine. This lack of focus, lack of attention to detail, lack of striving for perfection will catch up to Apple eventually if it is not arrested and corrected in time. So – sigh – we once again present to Apple CEO Tim Cook, where the buck supposedly stops, the Trophy for Misplaced Priorities: The Misplaced Priorities Trophy — MacDailyNews, November 29, 2017 Apple is not firing on all cylinders. The quality has been slipping for years and the mistakes, bad designs, stupid decisions, product delays and worse have been piling up. – MacDailyNews, May 18, 2017 Steve Jobs is irreplaceable, but someone with vision, taste, and focus is what’s required here. The magic of Steve Jobs was vision, focus on the products from the user’s point of view, fastidious attention to detail, and next-level marketing acumen. – MacDailyNews, January 29, 2018 Steve Jobs could make a power cord seem insanely great. Tim Cook could put a room to sleep while unveiling teleportation; he makes watching paint dry seem like must-see event. Apple is currently helmed by a charisma black hole. Sparks are therefor not emitted. Lacking a charismatic leader who could sell ice cubes to eskimos, execution is the key. High quality products and services that just work with timely updates in sufficient supply at launch… Apple’s issues with late, old, sometimes problematic products and services do more to dampen excitement and devotion than anything. – MacDailyNews, January 4, 2019 You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

With watchOS 11.5, Apple once again leads with a new Pride watch face. At this point, how many do we need? It feels like every update is more about social signaling than product improvement. We’ve got powerful health features, training tools, and performance updates… but the spotlight is always on Pride. Can every belief or identity get this kind of platform? Or just the ones Apple chooses? I miss when Apple led with innovation, not ideology. Pretty sure Steve Jobs would’ve kept the focus on the product. We now have enough Pride watch face and band iterations to wrap every Pride-wearing Apple Watch around the globe 8 times. Yes, I did the math (estimated). And more than the population of the world. Meanwhile Donald is on a golf course fudging his score. Sounds like you should switch to Windows since you are so offended that Cook isn’t kissing the fat ass of your favorite mob boss. Apple will be just fine, if it continues to act with respect and good faith with its suppliers and customers. Of course Timmy has always flown the gay pride flag, it’s who he is. Who cares. It doesn’t hurt anyone. The USA, however, is burning the bridges with all its former allies, and will be in recession or stagflation soon as the unilaterally stupid trade restrictions take effect. It will take years to recover. And no, neither Canada nor Greenland is ever going to become a US state. The insulting proposals to take over sovereign territories is beyond insulting. How much longer must we endure the caretaker which is Tim Cook? And becoming a broken record… Failed Car Program Failing Vision Pro program completely Missed AI and in rapid catch-up mode – if possible. Dude managed for 5-7 years too long at the helm. Need a visionary and innovator to lead the way and Cook ain’t it. Duh… Any suggestions? Because the best people are running their own companies and aren’t going to take a pay and power cut to run Apple. Jobs himself handpicked Cook to succeed him apparently without any consideration for him being a short-term “caretaker” CEO. The idea of the top person being the creative trailblazer is also a distortion. What’s important is for leaders to hire good lieutenants, delegate and allow for creative freedom. Don’t tell me there aren’t MANY brilliant people at Apple who for systemic reasons don’t have enough sway. Maybe Cook is the bottleneck but there’s no silver-bullet unicorn free agent out there. Craig Federighi would be a logical choice but who knows if he’s a good enough leader to run the entire organization. I heard from someone who met him that he’s an a-hole “do you know who I am?” but then again so was Jobs so it might be a good fit. Bringing an outsider who has no experience in Apple’s culture and structure could make things much worse, be careful what you wish for… Best to stay clear of the chaos that is the White House. MacDaily has become a Trump mouthpiece rather than a Mac-centric news site. People outside the USA can see what’s happening and now working around the chaos. The business performance of Cook in his worst year is substantially more successful AND SUSTAINABLE than the 6x bankrupt, 31x felon that this site worships. Speaking of waning influence … when Donald loses his last appeal for his attempts to take dictatorial power, including of course the power of taxation, away from the peoples’ representatives …. youll see manbaby melt down like the empty suit he is. All the reforms that could have been passed easily through the Republican legislature aren’t happening, because they are almost as inept as the Executive. So easily rescinded exec memos will be reversed in 3 years, and hopefully someone with fiscal responsibility will also undo the reckless spending AND reckless destruction of international trade. The USA has been severe crippled by the make-it-up-as-we-go diplomacy , the vindictive international diplomacy, and the now record debts this administration has presided over. Every nation in the world is now working hard to replace the USA as a trading partner, because nobody can trust the POTUS to keep his word. Awww… I bet you were so happy while the country under the senile idiot walking cadaver was in the WH. When he allowed MILLIONS of illegals in to country, did NOTHING to stop Russia to invade Ukraine, the economy in shambles while wasting BILLIONS in woke BS. Wrong. Biden, who actually nominated a competent staff which passed congressional reviews without controversy, urged congress to support Ukraine with weapons. Now Trump has halted the deals, which were profitable to the USA as well as successful in halting Russian ground advances, since Trump thinks he can bargain with his old buddy Putin. Turns out Trump can’t solve anything with “just a phone call”. Trump looks like an idiot, untrusted by both adversaries. Letting Putin become emperor of the former USSR with new allies North Korea and China would be the worst possible outcome of the situation. No US president has taken the necessary actions to strengthen US-European ties to ensure democracy survives in Eastern Europe. But feckless Donny has done a bang-up job destroying everyone’s confidence in the USA. Donny is happy to bomb Yemen but just doesn’t have the balls to fight communism or even help those countries who are. Or, in this case, since communism no longer exists, it is now Russian oligarchs’ fascism wrapped in a red flag. Something Donald has repeatedly claimed to admire. So much for the USA supporting the expansion of democracy in the world. Donny must really have enjoyed all those extra curricular activities at his pageants in Moscow, now he’s selling out the efforts of 4 generations of Americans who fought and died to prevent communist takeover of the world. Pathetic. We have a president who virtually never thinks rationally, logically, or even in sequential steps. Nor can he fully comprehend causes and effects. His base of knowledge on virtually all subjects relating to governance and economics and world affairs is minimal. He lacks empathy, conscience, morality, and remorse for the wrongs he commits. He is a pathological liar. He has severe and destructive personality disorders-narcissism, sociopathy, and paranoia. He speaks at the level of a fifth-grader, at best. He can barely spell and do simple math. And his already limited mental capacity deteriorates with each passing day. No one has lasting influence with this idiot. The prior one actually had no capacity to think! LOL Too bad Biff Tannen has no such thing as a brain… Almost half of Americans are too blind and brainless to notice that evidence, alas! WTF?! Obama has been out of the White House for quite a while now. Why bring him up other than the fact he was controlling Sleepy Joe. Sorry, but there was an election last November, and the man you described is no longer President. A guy named Trump won, and he is really making strides. He’s correcting all of Biden’s disasters. Tim Cook FAILED. He, who incredibly, took Apple from $1B (they called it bankrupt in 1998) to the first $1T, first $2T, first $3T co. in history, nearly wasted his entire legacy, by reducing his iQ to putting all his eggs in 1 basket, China. During C-19, China shut down factories for months, Apple desperately sought outsourcing to alternatives in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam etc. but is it too late and are Westerners too closed-minded/short-sighted/immature/infantile/naive to not think China would retaliate by moving out of their country? Tim met TRUMP so many times, yet still is the most affected by tariffs, making Apple suffer the biggest drop in years, so what is the point of Tim being close to T and where is his/Apple’s leverage?! How useful is Tim now? Is his presidency as dormant/senile as Biden’s? Tim could have been fired by iSteve, who did elect him, since Tim did not use Apple’s mojo since iSteve 2011-10-05, but only used iteration, updates, not even upgrades on all products. Tim Cook feel ASLEEP at the wheel, failed AppleCar “Project Titan” (2000>20204-02-27), failed iWatch cam, failed Apple Mail, failed Apple social media, failed Search engine, failed HomePod, SmartHome, failed ai etc. Perhaps Tim’s biggest miss is having let go of JONY IVE? Apple losing its soul/dna/mojo for 14 years since iSteve left an ambience of zero interest for Jony, who left 2019-07. Now Jony sells LoveFrom (off’l; Neo-Bauhaus? ; ) unnamed but prototyped AI hardware (release 2027?) to OpenAI, when he could have made it for Apple, which in so many recent failures could’ve gained its next iPhone moment & saved its mojo! Will the AI neck device by Jony/Altman, as a first in series of OpenAI hardware, kill Apple/Meta/Goo/Msft/Xiaomi/Huawei like an unexpected tsunami, as they figured out the perfect balance for the elixir or alchemy of iDevices, that defies gravity & flummoxes all competitors that go the wrong way… Of course, it is certainly not a pride to keep contact with a dangerous liar who plays with his country and the world as if it were a Monopoly game… First apple needs to return to live WWDC event. No pre recorded presentation, everything needs to be a live demo. No more DEI representation at the WWDC. Put the people forward that actual have ideas and can lead a talk without a teleprompter. Apple has turned into a fake mockery of their old self. First step on the road to recovery is return to live people. No more social engineered fake presentations by clueless people chosen as a diversity check box. Whhaaaaattt? Greasing Taco Don’s paw with a million bucks doesn’t endear him to the convicted felon? Sucking up to him – but not enough, apparently? Maybe Timmy shouldn’t have expected loyalty from a guy who measures that in time-stamped dollars. Giving him a million bucks months ago; jeez, that expired just about immediately. Trump is trashing America “the brand” worldwide. Tourism to USA down, American product purchases are cratering in Europe. The world is pivoting away from American goods and services…. And i suspect it will continue whilst the Trump is at the helm. Take a hard look at the ossified, glad-handing, CYA, elitist Board of Directors. There was a time when Board Members were intelligent, insightful, people who actually created new stuff. Now, at best, the Board Members just administrated stuff created ages ago by others. Caretaking is their stock in trade. Boring. Your email address will not be published.

This week: GameStop sinks after buying a boatload of Bitcoin, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues flying high, and Metaplanet makes a potentially risky sprint to amass a lot of BTC very quickly. GameStop Bitcoin flop GameStop found out this week that sinking half a billion dollars into Bitcoin isn’t universally flattering for share prices. The video game retailer spent $512 million on Bitcoin earlier this week, and the GME share price climbed as high as $35.78 the morning the BTC buy was announced. But it fell sharply the same day and still hasn’t recovered. GME closed Friday at $29.80—nearly 17% lower than that short-lived Wednesday peak. Now, don’t get us wrong: The revival of Trump tariff trouble has dealt a blow to crypto assets and securities alike. But GME was deep into its post-Bitcoin buy slide before an appeals court ruled that Trump’s tariff policies would remain in place. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter—the only Wall Streeter who still officially covers GME—told Barron’s that he’s not sold on GameStop being an attractive buy because of its Bitcoin ambitions. “It doesn't make sense to me that [GameStop] would be a 'better' steward of Bitcoin holdings,” he said. Pachter pointed out that the retailer is in no position to weather having a large portion of its treasury sitting in a volatile asset. For example, if Bitcoin were to drop 30% to about $70,000—a price it’s seen as recently as October—that would leave GME with an unrealized loss equal to its past four quarters of operating income. Interestingly, in April, Strive CEO Matt Cole highlighted purported infighting at GameStop over its Bitcoin strategy. But his advice that the company buy as much Bitcoin as it can, as quickly as possible, hasn’t aged particularly well. IBIT euphoria The BlackRock Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, pulled in more than $6.22 billion in net deposits this month to make this its best month on record—and that’s before the closing bell has rung on the last trading day in May. It helps, of course, that Bitcoin flirted with and then set a few new all-time high price marks. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X that it’s not a typical trajectory for a newly launched fund. “IBIT on fire lately, now has $72B in assets which ranks it 23rd overall, absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” he wrote. The fund has been so dominant that it’s accounted for 90% of all spot Bitcoin ETF flows in the past month. As a group, the twelve ETFs account for more than 6% of the circulating 19.8 million Bitcoin supply. But at $70.2 billion, IBIT accounts for 55% of the total $126 billion worth of assets under management by the issuers. But the milestone underscores what critics like Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE) say is a unique risk: There are only four different custodians used by the issuers to hold the Bitcoin that backs ETF shares. “This concern is amplified by the fact that none of the custodians are banks,” he wrote in a statement in February. At the time, he cited the SEC’s recently rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121. Despite the rule being rescinded, there hasn’t been much change in the lineup. Many of the issuers—including BlackRock, Grayscale, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and Valkyrie—use Coinbase Custody. The Invesco and Galaxy fund uses Galaxy as its custodian, but some of that BTC gets routed to Coinbase as a sub-custodian. BlackRock added Anchorage Digital as an additional custodian for its IBIT and ETHA funds in April. Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing shares of its Fidelity Bitcoin Trust, or FBTC, which is the next-largest fund. Metaplanet sprints—but at what cost? Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet is running, not walking, towards its goal of acquiring 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. That’s over $1 billion worth at the current price. With another buy earlier this week, Metaplanet now holds 7,800 Bitcoin. But that has, very literally, come at a cost to the company: Its debt-to-equity ratio has climbed to 8.43, according to Reuters. For context, the same ratio for Strategy—the company it’s trying to emulate—was 0.24 as of March 2025. There aren’t many comparisons we could make that would leave Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin juggernaut looking conservative after acquiring some $60 billion worth of BTC, but this is one of them. If Metaplanet’s game plan works out, then it could amplify returns for investors. But if Bitcoin tanks, then it could blow up spectacularly.

Then in python You may also try one of the provided test scripts pycbsdk is a pure Python package for communicating with a Blackrock Neurotech Cerebus device. It is loosely based on Blackrock's cbsdk, but shares no code nor is pycbsdk supported by Blackrock. pycbsdk's API design is intended to mimic that of a C-library. Indeed, a primary goal of this library is to help prototype libraries in other languages. After all, Python is a poor choice to handle high throughput data without some compiled language underneath doing all the heavy lifting. However, it's pretty useful as is! And so far it has been good-enough for some quick test scripts, and it even drops fewer packets than CereLink. So, please use it, and contribute! We are more than happy to see the API expand to support more features, or even to have an additional "pythonic" API. Upon initialization, the NSPDevice instance configures its sockets (but no connection yet), it allocates memory for its mirror of the device state, and it registers callbacks to monitor config state. When the connection to the device is established, two threads are created and started: connect() has startup_sequence=True by default. This will cause the SDK to attempt to put the device into a running state. Otherwise, it'll stay in its original run state.

Fidelity and Grayscale ETFs lead redemptions, while BlackRock and ETH funds maintain strong momentum. After a strong 10-day run of consistent inflows totaling over $4.26 billion, U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs faced a sharp reversal with $346.8 million in net outflows as per Farside Investors. This marks the largest daily withdrawal since 11th March, highlighting renewed investor caution. On a day marked by significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the exit with $166 million pulled out. This was followed closely by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $107.5 million in net redemptions. Several other funds, including those from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck, also experienced capital flight. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went against the wider market movement by drawing in $125 million in net inflows. This extended its impressive 34-day streak of daily inflows, with its total inflow nearing $49 billion and assets under management now topping $70 billion. In contrast to the recent downturn in Bitcoin ETF flows, spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs continued to attract investor interest, recording $92 million in net inflows on the 29th of May alone. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recorded more than $50 million in fresh inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since launching in July 2024. Seeing this, ETF Store President Nate Geraci had mentioned that this activity coincides with a broader trend, as over the past five weeks, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $9 billion, while gold ETFs have seen nearly $3 billion in outflows. With Bitcoin’s price slipping from $111K to around $105,615, the recent market correction may be fueling the shift in ETF momentum. The evolving market cycle appears to be increasingly driven by growing institutional involvement, particularly following the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and market dynamics. Reflecting on this trend, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju acknowledged a misjudged bear market prediction made in early 2025, only to witness Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high just two months later. Young Ju put it best when he said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reportedly continuing to add data centers after opening a cluster of them in Mexico earlier this year. The company is building new facilities in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, AWS CEO Matt Garman said, per a Friday (May 30) Bloomberg News report. As it works to increase its capacity to power artificial intelligence, AWS also aims to expand its stock of Nvidia’s latest semiconductor, the GB200, according to the report. “Demand is strong,” Garman said. PYMNTS reported in April that Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, said in a LinkedIn post that the company continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads.” At the time of that report, AWS had 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS in April that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. In January, AWS said it plans to invest at least $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” Roger Wehner, vice president of economic development at AWS, said at the time in a press release. The server market is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2028, according to a January report by IDC. The biggest builders of data centers include Amazon, Microsoft and Google Cloud as well as data center companies Digital Realty and Equinix. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI. It was reported May 21 that one of OpenAI’s future data centers secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments. The center, which is being constructed in the Texas community of Abilene, is slated for completion next year and is set to become the ChatGPT maker’s largest. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX.

Title: The New Safe Haven: How High-Net-Worth Investors Are Rethinking Liquidity In 2025

Time Published: 2025-05-30T19:15:06Z

In times of stress, wealth always chases after safety, but in 2025, the definition of “safe” has become much murkier. The investment landscape for high-net-worth (HNW) investors is undergoing a significant transformation, and the definition of safe assets is being re-evaluated. In a world marked by geopolitical instability and unpredictable market responses, liquidity is increasingly viewed as a measure of control, autonomy and psychological reassurance. Investors are quietly rewriting their liquidity playbooks, showcasing a shift in wealth psychology. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. U.S. Treasuries have long been the go-to choice during times of crisis. However, given recent events, even this asset class is being tested, and the long-standing fortress is showing some cracks. Once considered a safe corner of the market, it has become a battleground for hedge funds engaged in “basis trading”—speculative bets on price gaps between Treasuries and their futures. These trades depend heavily on repo funding, which can dry up suddenly in market stress. When that happens, funds can be forced to unwind positions en masse, potentially triggering liquidity spirals. This played out in March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a global dash for cash and repo markets abruptly tightened, forcing hedge funds to unwind their positions. This led to increased volatility and liquidity strains in the Treasury market. To try to stabilize, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented emergency measures, including large-scale purchases of Treasury securities. Today’s market faces similar worries. The issue isn’t just volatility—it’s structural fragility and the interconnectedness of financial institutions, which can result in systemic risks, especially during sudden liquidity withdrawal. The Fed is concerned about the web of dependencies connecting hedge funds, clearinghouses and banks via the Treasury repo market. Still, Treasuries aren’t dead, and it’s too early to write them off. Short-duration T-bills, in particular, remain a preferred instrument among risk-aware investors because they strike the combination of traits that many HNWIs crave: relatively low risk, reasonable yield and—most importantly—liquidity. In a world where things can go sideways overnight, the ability to exit positions swiftly and without disruption is valued more than incremental returns. If T-bills represent cautious optimism, Bitcoin is starting to reflect something else: digital autonomy. Cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche domain for risk-happy technophiles. Bitcoin is finding its way into the portfolios of younger HNW investors who view it less as a speculative instrument and more as a tool of financial independence. In an era of bank bail-ins, frozen accounts and political uncertainty, Bitcoin offers psychological insurance—a way to preserve access to one’s funds independently of centralized banking systems. For many, it represents a safety net in a world where financial infrastructure feels increasingly fragile. Moreover, the credibility of cryptocurrencies as an asset class has grown considerably in recent times. Bitcoin is now held in ETFs and on major custodial platforms like BlackRock and Fidelity, reinforcing its legitimacy as an institutionally accepted asset. Notable regulatory milestones such as MiCA in the EU and ETF approvals in the U.S. are reframing crypto as a “compliant asset.” This is a big boost to their appeal among conservative HNWIs. Crypto as a whole still remains a volatile asset class. But, in a way, that volatility is understood and accepted these days. Bitcoin’s appeal persists because what rattles people more is not volatility but the lack of access. Being unable to move one’s money in a moment of stress is the greatest fear that transcends crypto and touches every asset class right now. In that regard, cryptocurrencies offer an increasingly popular alternative option. That said, most institutional capital continues to flow into Bitcoin—and to a lesser degree, Ethereum. But not the broader crypto ecosystem. The narrative of legitimacy appears to be mostly confined to these two assets for now. Gold has also re-entered the spotlight, but not for the usual reasons—this time, the focus is not on inflation fears and the metal’s traditional role as a hedge. Gold’s demand today is driven by the desire to de-dollarize and mitigate geopolitical exposure. Central banks around the world are increasing their reserves, seeking insulation from financial shocks and growing geopolitical tensions. Many countries now view gold as a neutral reserve asset that can be used to insulate their economies from U.S. monetary policy and reduce reliance on the dollar in international transactions. High-net-worth investors are also taking note of this trend, choosing gold as a store of value not just to diversify, but to reduce exposure to global fiat-driven volatility. Gold offers something that other assets cannot: a tangible, non-digital store of value that operates outside the influence of any single currency or government. Unlike Bitcoin, you can’t email it to yourself across borders, but in terms of psychological safety, it still holds a unique place. In an increasingly digitized and interconnected world, gold reminds people that some wealth should be physically untouchable to feel permanent and reliable. It’s as much about emotional security as it is about portfolio strategy. What all of these asset shifts have in common is a growing recognition that liquidity is not just a technical metric, it is also an emotional comfort zone. Investors no longer ask, “Can I sell this?” They ask, “Can I get out if things go bad, before everyone else?” How quickly and predictably they can do so when market conditions deteriorate is a key factor up for consideration these days. Recent events have demonstrated just how quickly liquidity can vanish. From the UK’s LDI pension crisis to Silicon Valley Bank’s overnight implosion, the lesson is clear: in a digital, interconnected world, liquidity crunches arrive with little to no warning. Not because of poor asset selection, but because too many people hit the “sell” button at the same time, and the markets just can’t handle it. This results in a new set of investor priorities. Access, execution flexibility and operational resilience now rank alongside—or above—yield and long-term appreciation in wealth management discussions. So what does this mean for advisors, private banks and family offices? It means that traditional approaches to portfolio construction are no longer sufficient. Today’s clients are asking deeper questions about asset behavior under stress, and they expect precise, actionable answers. In response to this changing mindset, asset managers should keep several strategies in mind. First: segmentation matters. Advisors need to start viewing portfolios not just in terms of risk and reward, but also in terms of exit timelines. What can be liquidated in a day? A week? A quarter? Segment portfolios by liquidity tiers to offer greater clarity and control. That’s how investors are learning to think now. Second: diversify not just across assets, but across liquidity types. Investment-grade corporate bonds might carry more credit risk than Treasuries, for example, but they offer alternatives for those seeking yield without locking up capital long-term. Third: embrace transparency and offer real-time monitoring tools. Dashboards that show bid-ask spreads, margin call thresholds and funding market stress aren’t just for CIOs anymore—clients want to be able to see them too. In 2025, liquidity is no longer just a technical detail. It’s a board-level issue. It influences asset selection, client satisfaction and, ultimately, institutional resilience. The biggest takeaway? Liquidity must be built before it’s needed. In volatile periods, buffers are tested, often brutally and with no warning, so make sure to construct them while there’s relative calm. Stress test everything, and remember: the true mark of safety isn’t an asset’s label or historical reputation—it’s how it behaves when the music stops. Investors and institutions must take the initiative to prepare for liquidity shocks, because when the stress hits, the window to act is often measured in minutes, not days.

Title: Refused Debate Festival Boycott in Supporting Palestine

Time Published: 2025-05-30T18:40:14Z

Refused admittedly considered boycotting some upcoming festival appearances after learning that one of the financial backers had invested in Israeli Cyber Security amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. But rather than doing so, they detailed some of the thought provoking conversations that took place in deciding how to approach what to do in trying to share their support for Palestine amidst reports from Al Jazeera of starving citizens due to Israel's blockade from aid. The veteran rockers announced that they would be embarking on a farewell tour this year and that includes a number of appearances at music festivals around the world. The band revealed their initial gut reaction to drop off an unnamed festival after learning that the event had a financial investor that didn't align with their political view and had.dealings in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. But, when reaching out to the festival to share their concerns, they were confronted with discussion of some of the problematic players that have a hand in other parts of their business. That led to a multi-layered discussion about how to proceed, the effectiveness of the band boycotting the festival and what the band could actually do to best show their support for the starving Palestinians that inspired their reaction. As stated, rather than immediately acting on the impulse to boycott select festivals they were playing that had a perceived problematic financial backer, Refused reached out to festival organizers that led to a larger discussion on how to best address their concerns. The band shared a detailed account on social media about some of the discussions that were had, which can be read below: So a week ago we found out that some of the festival we're playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli Cyber Security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they'd created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they'd started working with them, staining their life's work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that Live Nation are behind some other festivals and shows we're playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump's inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestinian organizations. So, the conundrum became: Boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band's legacy wouldn't been tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. It would feel nice, but it wouldn't do any good; Being morally superior doesn't put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. Also it wouldn't make headlines; We're not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we're not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn't raise many eyebrows. We've mulled this over and although there's a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equeity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it's non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it it the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we'd love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we're playing. FREE PALESTINE!!! The band continued their discussion in the comments section of their post. "These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas," they shared. "These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we're being self-critical for a moment, it's obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion's share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now)," Refused added. They continued, "It took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at uni: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant." From there the group offered, "This didn't deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light." READ MORE: Bands Who Broke Up + Ones Who Reunited in 2024 "The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces," they recalled. "There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there's no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It's what we're most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn't preach to the converted, they didn't freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit," continued the band. In conclusion, they stated, "I guess what we're trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we've driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later." As stated, Refused are in the midst of their farewell tour. The band kicked off a North American run earlier this spring. They'll start up their next tour leg on June 13 at the Nova Rock festival in Nickelsdorf, Austria with European dates booked through Aug. 22 in Vilar De Mouros, Portugal. More dates in the U.K. and Europe will follow in October with the band currently booked through Oct. 12 in Munchen, Germany.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See $9 Billion Inflows Amid Escalating Shift Away From Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent trends in the Bitcoin ETFs market reveal a significant shift in investor sentiment, with funds flowing into BTC exchange-traded funds while gold-backed funds experience notable outflows. According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal. In addition to these factors, Bitcoin appears to be shedding its previous reputation as merely a tech-adjacent risk asset. Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

Title: STEPHEN MOORE: Why Are Trump’s Regulators Fighting A War On Coal?

In one of the most convoluted lawsuits of all time, a cabal of state attorney generals and the Federal Trade Commission are now accusing financial firms Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard of monopolistic behavior. The complaint asserts that these firms bought coal stocks and then helped impose radical environmental restrictions on the companies they partially own, so that coal output would fall and the price of coal would rise. The lawsuit alleges that this strategy generated “supra-competitive profits” for those investors. If your head is spinning around trying to make heads or tails out of this loopy conspiracy theory – it should be. If it were true, then these asset managers must be capable of pulling off the equivalent of a triple-bank shot in billiards. They allegedly invested in coal companies, then partnered together with climate change groups to drive coal companies bankrupt, which then drove up the price of coal. If that tactic worked to make money, Kelloggs would stop making Frosted Flakes so that the price of the last boxes on the grocery store shelves sold for $100. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: Biden’s Student Loan Forgiveness Made Defaults Skyrocket) What’s laughable about this lawsuit is that the Vanguards of the world didn’t need to conspire to restrict coal production: that’s what Democrats like Joe Biden and the environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have been doing for years. They are the ones who are guilty of any conspiracy to rip off consumers, bankrupt an American industry, put blue collar workers out of jobs, and raise energy prices. They ran multi-million dollar campaigns to “kill coal” by advancing a “net zero” fossil fuel energy policy on America with the explicit goal of shutting down coal plants. Their plan – at least temporarily – wildly succeeded. Over the past 15 years, 63 major coal companies have closed their mining operations. And just where exactly are these Supra-profits” that the FTC and the state lawyers are asserting? It’s true that for a short while in 2022 and 2023 coal and oil profits soared as a result of Biden’s war on energy. Maybe this isn’t taught in the top law schools, but money management firms with trillions of dollars of asset like Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard don’t invest in companies and then try to steer them into bankruptcy. That’s a money-losing proposition every time – except in Mel Brooks’ famous broadway show The Producers in which two scamsters conspire to make a show that would intentionally flop. That was a make-believe comedy. This lawsuit is too, but no one is laughing. Even the claim that the three firms on trial here worked with environmental groups to reduce coal output is highly suspect. It is true that some of the large investment companies promoted the radical climate agenda? And just like Bud Light, they paid a hefty price for their political activism. Unleash Prosperity – a group I cofounded – has done the seminal analysis over the last several years on how investment firms voted on radical green agenda shareholder resolutions dealing with among other things shutting down coal. It is true that State Street has been a strong and persistent supporter of some of these shareholder resolutions aimed at advancing the radical anti-coal green agenda. But Vanguard almost never votes in favor of resolutions hostile to the industry. And Blackrock in recent years has sworn off the ESG investing fad. So they all can’t all be guilty here since their shareholder activism runs in opposite directions! Apparently, their real crime was owning coal stocks at all. If this lawsuit were to succeed, then three of America’s largest investors would pay a giant penalty for that sin. The biggest loser will be the coal industry itself, as a guilty verdict would chase billions of dollars of desperately investment out of the coal industry for many years which will mean coal miners will lose their jobs. This may explain why many of the state attorney generals from coal producing states like Kentucky and Ohio didn’t join this flimsy case. Sadly, Andrew Ferguson, the chair of the FTC, may do more to destroy the coal industry than all of the radical climate change groups put together. But wait. Trump has run for president and signed executive orders to support King Coal in America. He wants an American coal renaissance. How can that happen when the FTC stands ready to sue these company’s investors if they dare make “supra profits?” Sounds like if Trump wants to make American coal great again, he might want to make a call over to his handpicked FTC chair Andrew Ferguson and get him to cease and desist.

Title: SEC clarifies proof-of-stake isn’t ‘security’ – Road clear for spot ETH ETF staking?

There’s only one obstacle for ETH ETF to clear before staking approval. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Division of Corporation Finance, clarified that some staking activities are not security transactions. Commenting on the directive, Commissioner Hester Pierce acknowledged it as a ‘welcome clarity’ for firms offering staking services. “Today’s statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and “staking-as-a-service” providers in the United States. The Division’s statement is applicable to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake network.” This meant that PoS systems like Ethereum [ETH], Solana [SOL], Cardano, and others are non-securities. Besides, the guidance applied to self and custodial (delegated) staking, including liquid staking, according to Rebecca Rettig, Jito Labs’ legal officer. “This bodes very well for other types of non-custodial staking activity, including liquid staking.” Compared to the Biden-era regime, this was a massive shift. The Biden-era SEC fined Kraken exchange $30M, claiming that its staking service constituted unregistered security offerings. Now, under the new Trump-era SEC, offering such service doesn’t need registration with the agency. This followed a similar update on PoW (proof-of-work) or mining-based blockchains like Bitcoin. Put differently, both PoW and PoS arrangements aren’t securities offerings. This begs the question: Will the agency greenlight the much-sought U.S. spot ETH ETF staking? ETF Store’s Nate Geraci noted that the only remaining hurdle was the IRS tax clarification. “Another hurdle cleared for staking in spot ETH ETFs. Now need clarity from IRS on how staking revenue handled in grantor trust (which is the structure used for spot ETH ETFs).” In Q2, ETH staking saw renewed interest, growing from 33M ETH to over 34M ETH, with an average annualized return of 3%. If approved, ETF buyers could enjoy these staking rewards without worrying about the complicated ways of staking individual ETH or the risks involved. So, staking rewards could improve demand for products apart from relying on price appreciation alone. In fact, most ETH ETF holders were underwater, according to Glassnode. “The average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs are now substantially underwater on their position, holding an unrealized loss of approximately -21% on average.” Source: Glassnode That said, the positive news didn’t stir the ETH price. In fact, the altcoin’s spot market demand declined further, as shown by the downward movement on the spot CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta). But, the Open Interest (OI) remained elevated, suggesting high speculative interest and market leverage. Source: Coinalyze Unless ETH’s pot market demand improves, the high leverage could complicate the rally and heighten liquidation risks. At press time, the altcoin was valued at $2.62K and has been consolidating between $2.3K and $2.7K in May.

One answer, and an increasingly popular one at that, is: pivot to crypto—or more specifically, become a crypto treasury company. The previously unknown online gambling marketer SharpLink Gaming did just that earlier this week, when it announced it had raised $425 million in investment to establish an Ethereum treasury. It was a notable departure from the more common route of building a Bitcoin treasury, with Ethereum being the second largest and most liquid crypto asset on the market next to Bitcoin. As part of the raise, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined SharpLink’s board of directors. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Before going all in on Ethereum, SharpLink had a market capitalization of around $2 million, trading for just over $2 per share and was just weeks ago dangerously close to being delisted from the Nasdaq for falling below the $1 per share minimum. On Tuesday, everything changed: The company’s stock jumped 420% to $35 per share, with a market cap above $23 million. It’s a strategy reminiscent of, well, Strategy. Michael Saylor’s company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, laid down the blueprint for how this works: you buy up a bunch of Bitcoin (or, in Sharplink’s case, Ethereum), and your stock functions as a proxy bet on the crypto asset. Shares in a crypto treasury company will often trade at a premium to the digital assets because, for the average investor, it’s much easier to buy stock than fiddle around with crypto directly. Before being worth $101.76 billion and amassing a Bitcoin treasure chest worth over $60 billion, MicroStrategy was floundering at a double-digit share price as a fairly average business intelligence software solutions company. MicroStrategy then bought $425 million in Bitcoin in the fall of 2020. The same amount in Ethereum that SharpLink plans to buy. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy came out of nowhere. Just like SharpLink did Tuesday. So what is SharpLink, and where did it come from? SharpLink was co-founded in 2019 by now-CEO Rob Phythian and former COO Chris Nicholas, who left the company in 2024. Tori Roberts joined the team in 2021 as vice president, in charge of affiliate marketing with Robert DeLucia following in 2022 as chief financial officer. According to the official SharpLink site, there are also three independent directors in Leslie Bernhard, Robert Gutkowski, and Obie McKenzie that make up the board of directors, chaired by Phythian himself. Bernhard has previously served as a director and chairman in multiple Nasdaq-listed companies, Gutkowski helped seal a $486 million cable distribution deal, and McKenzie was a managing director at BlackRock. So, it appears at least, the directors are a capable bunch. Put simply, SharpLink Gaming uses technology to help match sports betting companies with fans. According to its LinkedIn page, the company now uses an AI tool that collects and analyzes behavioral insights on users, pushes relevant betting content onto those users, and converts them into paying customers. Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, it currently sits at a market cap of $55 million trading at nearly $80 per share, already doubling its price since Tuesday, according to data on Trading View. If you bought SBET stock five years ago, though, you’re still down around 67%. The company’s revenues declined 26.1% from 2023 to 2024, last year's financial report showed, with cash on hand decreasing by 42.2% to $1.43 million. That said, it saw a positive net income of $10 million, a notable rise from a net loss of $14.2 million. In 2024, SharpLink Gaming sold two of its businesses for $22.5 million, used most of these proceeds to write off outstanding debts, and completed a domestic merger that changed the company from an Israeli LLC to a Delaware corporation, according to a company release. In July 2024, the board of directors started a formal review process to “evaluate strategic alternatives” that would “drive growth and create and maximize value” for stockholders. It appears that in this process, the board of directors started to consider cryptocurrency more seriously. In February 2025, the company announced that it acquired a 10% equity stake in Armchair Enterprises Limited, a company that owns CryptoCasino.com, as part of a strategy to become the “first Nasdaq-listed company focused on crypto gaming.” “We carefully evaluated more than two dozen compelling opportunities,” SharpLink CEO Phythian said in a release, referencing the board’s review process. “And [we] determined that the combination of market expansion, cost efficiency, security and player demand makes crypto gaming one of the most promising growth opportunities in the online gaming industry today.” But this initial crypto pivot wasn’t enough to prevent the price of SBET stock from dropping 60.8%, from $5.75 to $2.26, over the next two and a half months. During this period, SharpLink announced a reverse stock split to stay above Nasdaq’s stock price minimum requirement of $1. And then a $4.5 million public stock offering in order to regain “compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum requirement for total stockholders’ equity.” Things were existential for SharpLink. But that was before the Ethereum treasury strategy led its stock price to surge 420% on Tuesday to $35 a share—and now more than doubling that. Rob Phythian co-founded SharpLink and today serves as its CEO and chairman of the board of directors. And now he’s the Ethereum Michael Saylor. Pythian founded SharpLink after he spent almost nine and a half years as CEO of SportsHub Technologies, a company that created games and apps for sports gaming sites. Prior to that, he’d also co-founded SportsData LLC, a sports experience creator, and served as its CEO and president. During his time at SportsHub, he was named by a local business publication as one of the top 100 people to know in Minnesota. Phythian was hailed a pioneer and a “sports tech godfather.” One former business partner told Decrypt that he has great respect for Pythian. "I worked with Rob maybe 10 or 15 years ago on [an unnamed] skill gaming venture,” Matthew Warneford, CEO of Roblox game creator Dubit, told Decrypt. “Rob's a great guy, very smart, and good to work with. Have nothing but positive things to say." By 2023, now CEO of SharpLink, Phythian and his company started to embrace artificial intelligence. In a guest blog post for Sportico, he outlined a future where AI could help personalize the sport fan experience, while also batting away concerns that AI outputs are too generic as he believed that the tide was turning. A year later, it was clear that the company needed a new direction, and Pythian led the company through its shift to crypto gaming. And now he’s leading SharpLink into its next phase as the Microstrategy of Ethereum. The question now is: Will it work? If Phythian follows Saylor’s playbook, then the next step will be to sell shares, or debt against those shares, to buy more Ethereum. Then rise and repeat. That likely bodes well for ETH—and perhaps even SBET shareholders. But what it means for SharpLink as a business is an open question. It’s a gamble, but one that so far appears to be paying off.

Title: Why Ethereum’s 45.98% Q2 returns might just be the start of what’s next

Stay tuned as ETH looks to extend its outperformance and challenge new highs. Though fleeting, a sharp divergence on the 29th of May threw a curveball at the crypto crowd. Ethereum [ETH] surged 1.87% intraday, breaking out to a fresh three-month high at $2,791. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] took a counter move, dipping 2.01%. According to AMBCrypto, it underscored a rare ETH-BTC decoupling that’s turning heads on the order books: Could this subtle divergence be the spark that ignites Ethereum’s next power rally? Q2 has been nothing short of a flex for Ethereum. It has nearly doubled returns, leaving Bitcoin’s 30.2% gains eating dust, despite BTC notching fresh all-time highs. Still, most of the liquidity has been BTC-bound, with ETH grinding sideways for weeks. But that script may be flipping. The ETH/BTC pair is perking up, printing a breakout structure that mirrors early May setup. Over the last four sessions, the ratio has climbed close to 6%, while Bitcoin has dropped 5.05% on the week. Ethereum, on the other hand, has only slipped 1.06%, showing notable relative strength. According to AMBCrypto, it is the kind of setup that often front-runs a rotation play. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Case in point: Back in early May, ETH broke free from a sluggish range and ripped 50% higher in under a week, while Bitcoin chopped sideways near $103k. As May comes to a close, Bitcoin is once again caught in a tight trading range, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to capitalize on its relative strength. Ethereum’s divergence from Bitcoin wasn’t a coincidence. Instead, it’s backed by some serious flow action. On the 29th of May, while BTC ETFs hemorrhaged nearly $340 million in outflows, Ethereum ETFs raked in a solid $91.9 million. Fidelity and Bitwise both saw fresh inflows, bucking the trend set by Bitcoin’s heavy BlackRock IBIT ETF-driven inflows. Meanwhile, whales (holding 1,000+ ETH) are loading up fast over the past four days, perfectly syncing their moves with Bitcoin’s recent slump. Source: Glassnode On both the charts and the chain, Ethereum looks primed to capitalize on another rotation window, setting the stage for a potential mega rally against BTC’s volatility. As Q2 wraps up, with ETH historically outpacing BTC by a wide margin, all eyes should stay locked on Ethereum, as it looks like it’s gearing up to deliver more alpha for savvy investors.

Title: How Institutional Investors Are Ramping Up Climate Investments In 2025

ByMindy Lubber ByMindy Lubber, Contributor. In today’s investment landscape, large institutional investors are increasingly matching capital with a clean energy future. A recent Mercer Investment study of 74 large asset owners-- with more than $2 trillion in assets--found that 70% now integrate responsible investment goals into their strategies, a seven percentage jump from last year. Despite shifting rhetoric in some corners of the market, momentum continues to build. The Mercer study underscores this powerful trend—a growing majority are not only setting clear responsible investment goals, they’re also increasing how much they allocate to those investments. Responsible Investment Goals Now Central to Portfolio Strategy From New York to Oregon to Ontario, asset owners-- the investors that include pension funds, endowments, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and wealth managers--are making clear that managing climate risk and seizing investment opportunities are central to long-term fiduciary duty. In 2025, that’s translating into investors pouring more capital into climate solutions at scale, reporting progress on portfolio emissions, and supporting public policies that enable a future-ready economy. Major Pension Funds Raise Expectations for Asset Managers Across North America, public officials and investment leaders are raising the bar for themselves-- and the asset managers they do business with. In April, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees the city’s pension funds, laid out clear transition plan expectations for investment managers. Asset managers working with the New York City Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Retirement System, and Board of Education Retirement System must deliver credible, detailed transition plans—or he would recommend putting those managers’ investment mandates out to bid. Highlighting the financial stakes for states and the public funds they manage, Maryland’s state comptroller released a report in April on how inaction on extreme weather issues is straining the state’s economy and budget. Economic impacts include workforce disruptions, agricultural losses, tourism declines, supply chain disruptions, infrastructure damage, and loss of essential services. And underscoring the critical role of policy advocacy in helping asset owners meet their fiduciary duty, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner backed state legislation introduced in January to strengthen the Treasury’s ability to manage risks. The bill supports the Treasury’s ability to pursue the near- and long-term investment strategies needed to reduce climate-related investment risks and protect the Oregon public employee retirement fund. Momentum is also strong north of the border. In February, a group of Canadian asset owners representing CAD 53 billion issued a call for the country’s financial institutions to stay committed to their net zero goals and to translate them into robust action plans--essential for maintaining a competitive and stable financial system. European Investors Reconsider U.S. Exposure The consequences of wavering on climate action are also becoming increasingly tangible. Major European investors are reassessing their exposure to U.S. asset managers amid concerns about declining policy certainty and a perceived erosion of leadership in the clean economy. Dutch pension fund PME, which manages €57 billion, is reviewing a €5 billion mandate with BlackRock following its exit from a key responsible investing group. Meanwhile, Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, noted last month that clients have “massively repositioned” to avoid U.S. markets, driven by unease over inconsistent clean economy policy signals and other geopolitical concerns. The message from institutional investors in 2025 is clear: climate strategy is foundational to fiduciary duty. As stewards of long-term capital, asset owners are not just adapting to a changing world; they’re shaping it.

More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher, hitting an all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin last ... More week before dropping back. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”

Title: Renovation of social home in Blackrock cost local council €200,000 to bring back into use

Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council spent more than €200,000 bringing a vacant social home in Blackrock, south Dublin back into use last year. The local authority said it spent €503,142 on “three major refurbishment properties” to re-let in 2024. This included the property in Blackrock, which was built in 1957 and had the same tenant for 63 years. A unit in Glasthule, built in 1934 with the same tenant for 39 years, cost €146,414. The other property was in Dún Laoghaire, constructed in 1932, had same tenant for 49 years, and cost €138,581. “They were all major refurbishments due to the condition of the properties when they were handed back to the council,” a spokeswoman for the council said. “One required an existing extension to be demolished and rebuilt, all required works such as electrical rewiring upgrade works, energy upgrades works, insulation works, external roof works, full new kitchen installations and replastering of internal roofs and walls.” [ Intimidation in a Dublin suburb, and the derelict house being used as stablesOpens in new window ] The Department of Housing and Local Government said it is committed to supporting local authorities implementing an asset management ICT (information and communications technology) system to allow for “strategic and informed planned maintenance work programmes” supported by stock condition surveys. “This approach will ensure that homes are maintained on an ongoing basis and not only maintained at the time of vacancy in some cases after a significant period of time,” it said. “This will result in less works required on re-let, less costs associated and ensure homes are turned around as quick as possible.” The Programme for Government commits to introducing a new voids programme, to implement long-term strategic reforms and mandate local authorities to establish voids frameworks to improve the turnaround of vacant social housing units. However, the department said there is “no set time frame in place” for the new programme. Void is the term given to when tenants vacate houses or flats, either transferring to somewhere more suitable or leaving to purchase their own property. The death of a tenant or a marital breakdown can also result in a void unit. [ Elderly residents of Dublin 8 complex still feel ‘unsafe’ despite installation of security gateOpens in new window ] Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers Blackrock, Dundrum, Dún Laoghaire, Sandyford, Killiney, Shankill and Stillorgan, said it re-tenanted 111 properties last year as part of what it would consider to be “normal re-let processes”. The average cost per property was €31,190. “The length of time a property remains vacant depends on the condition of the property when it is returned to the council and the amount of information required to complete the allocation process,” it added. “Every effort is being made to ensure properties are tenanted as quickly as possible. In 2025, re-let works have been completed on 39 properties to date at an average cost of €17,580.” The council’s average re-let time for vacant properties in 2023 was 23 weeks. Dublin City Council said the average cost of refurbishing void units in 2024 was €44,000. It said when a unit becomes vacant it allows two weeks for tenants to remove any personal belongings, a 10- to 16-week period to revamp the property as well as a two-week period to allow a new tenant to inspect the property and move in. Fingal County Council said it refurbished and brought back into use 79 voids, excluding energy efficiency retrofit works, at a total cost of €1.7 million (or an average of €21,519 per unit). The average re-let period was 33 weeks. South Dublin County Council said it allocated 184 re-let properties at an average turnaround time of 20.64 weeks last year. Taoiseach Micheál Martin hit out at local authorities for the delay in releasing vacated properties to those on waiting lists in the Dáil last month. Mr Martin said local authorities take “too long to release a home that has been vacated”. “It can take sometimes months or a year for the local authority fill the same house again, and they cite all sorts of reasons, and it’s not good enough,” he said. “And now they’re looking for more and more grants to fill those voids.” He said those homes “should be filled fairly quickly, within a week or two of a house being vacated, unless there’s some structural issue” but added that the majority of cases did not involve structural issues.

Title: 100 of the best restaurants, cafes and places to eat in Dublin, Cork, Galway and around Ireland

It’s all change in Barna, where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright, open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and is carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes, but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave [ Great places for sunny outdoor dining around DublinOpens in new window ] Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC [ ‘People don’t just want dinner – they want an occasion’: Restaurants share their secrets to survivalOpens in new window ] Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consommé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero-waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. JC It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes such as seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stonewalled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin-star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH Five years ago Eunice Power opened her upmarket chipper in Dungarvan, setting a new benchmark for fish and chips by the sea. While the menu offers classic fish suppers, fish burgers and even fish tacos, there’s also chicken and beef burgers, plus a fish spice box for those feeling adventurous. The real standout? Eunice’s commitment to local produce, sourcing from a range of fishing boats in Cork and Waterford whenever possible. CH Morning starts strong with dosa, idli, vada, peserattu and uttappam, hammered out fast and hot with proper chai. By lunch, it’s birianis, thali platters and mutton fry, all packed with heat, spice and serious firepower. The original on Marlborough Street now has a second branch on Abbey Street – newer, just as sharp. The menu runs deep, from Gobi 65 and lamb Chettinadu to rich fish curry, and is built for repeat visits. CH Bart and Nicole Pawlukojc’s cafe runs an all-day brunch on one side of the street, with world flavours drawn from Poland, the Philippines and beyond, punched up by jars of pickles and ferments lined along the high counter. It swings from sharp, umami-rich plates to comforting classics, backed by natural wines and a sharp seasonal menu. Across the road, their bakery draws steady queues for award-winning sourdough, pastries and coffee. CH Dublin’s wine bar scene has exploded, but Bar Pez – Star Wine List Grand Prix winner – sets the standard. Manager Tommy Vivian runs the floor, while the 300+ list focuses on pet-nats, biodynamics and serious growers. Chris McCann (Volpe Nera) leads the kitchen, with Simone Tamilio (Allta) in rotation. Hake ceviche with rhubarb is cold and clean; boudin noir with Coolea rarebit is rich and exact; and scallop toast with plum chilli jam brings real heat. Open Sunday and Monday nights, it’s where chefs and sommeliers go when they’re off the clock. CH Enjoy a little taste of southern comfort cooking down on Cork’s own Bayou. Located in a gorgeous space on MacCurtain Street, start the day with a breakfast of coke and bourbon glazed ham with biscuits, eggs and fried potatoes. For lunch, try the New Orleans classics of po’boys, muffuletta, jambalaya or gumbo, finished with a powdery sweet beignet. In the words of head chef Joshua Crawford, this is non-fussy food, prepared well. JC Bearú in New Ross has a new look – a public square and outdoor seating ready for summer – but the kitchen stays tight. Breakfast and lunch run daily, with pastry from Claire Griffin. Dinner is Friday and Saturday only: a three-course a la carte with hand-rolled gnocchi, Kilmore Quay scallops and Wexford strawberries. Three choices per course, built around whatever the boats and farms bring in that week. CH Don’t be deceived by the apparent simplicity of Feast, the little village restaurant from Melissa McCabe, a former contestant on the Great British Menu, and Roisin McCaffrey. The devil is in the details, from the sleek ceramic coffee cups on wooden coasters to some truly innovative flavour combinations. Try the breakfast sausage roll with peanut butter and chilli jam, toasted sandwiches that pack a punch or an elegant creamy chowder. Feast is just as charming as Rostrevor itself. JC Always buzzing, Takashi Miyazaki‘s bistro and natural wine bar is the place to go for casual Japanese food. The Michelin star has been handed back, but it’s been replaced by fun and a whole lot of hand-pulled noodles. The creativity has never been higher, with plates such as grilled aubergine with red yuzu miso and chicken or udon noodles with white curry topped with creamy potato foam. JC Pillowy flatbreads, creamy hummus and smoky babaganoush are always a good bet at Izz, Alkarajeh and Eman Abu Rabi‘s superb Palestinian cafe. Fill up with manaeesh, a traditional topped flatbread, or swoon over the rich, showstopping magloubeh, a mix of rice, chicken and vegetable served upside down from the pot. Finish with flaky warbat filled with rose water cream and make sure to look out for their first cookbook, Jibrin, this summer. JC Jess and Dave Murphy opened their Galway restaurant in 2011, keeping it casual by day with a revolving lunch menu and shifting to a tighter, more serious dinner service at night. Dishes run to Connemara crab with kohlrabi and roe, lamb with asparagus, and agnolotti del plin stuffed with Connemara surf clams. Their Michelin Green Star reflects a serious commitment to local sourcing and sustainability, built around the circular economy rather than lip service. CH Still one of the best-loved Chinese restaurants in Dublin, this Sichuan stalwart just off O’Connell Street draws Chinese diners first, and everyone else second. Fresh dumplings, green beans with garlic and chilli, glossy aubergine, and deep-fried sea bass show a kitchen that has never lost its edge. Go with a gang – you’ll want to hit the menu properly – and there’s a private room upstairs if you need it. BYOB with €7 corkage keeps the tables packed. CH The little sibling to Good Day Deli, Nádúr occupies a charming small 18th-century building, with seating indoors and outdoors. The ethos here is sustainable plates, coffees and natural wines which celebrate the connection between the food and the natural world. Try Gort na Náin asparagus with burette on sourdough, Goatsbridge smoked trout smørrebrød or the chipotle béchamel and Hegarty’s cheddar toastie. JC Alain Morice runs a 20-seat deli, daytime bistro and wine bar, mixing French technique with Irish produce. The small menu changes weekly, with pâté en croûte – pork, fig and herbs wrapped in pastry – as a regular feature. Galway snails come drenched in garlic butter. Roast chicken with Dauphinoise is straightforward and serious. Desserts are made in-house by Morice’s sister, keeping it all tight and in the family. CH Conor Halpenny cooks with confidence and a sense of fun. Home-made crisps buried under a flurry of cheese, a warm Coolea biscuit with whipped ricotta and walnuts, and lamb mince on toast with cucumber and mint set things off fast. The Square “KFC” and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese keep the mood lively. Bigger plates follow – slow roast lamb, sirloin steak, monkfish with pickled mussels – backed by a tight, thoughtful wine list. CH St Francis Provisions shines all year around, but with summer on the way, everything truly bursts into life in Kinsale. Chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez’s plates are deceptive, packed with flavours that are bigger than the cosy little room. Grilled ox tongue, cod with confit peppers or salty gildas, everything is magical, especially when paired with one of their excellent pet-nat wines. JC David O’Halloran and Martin Buckley – better known as “the lads from The Lifeboat” – bought their Courtmacsherry pub in 2017 and became a low-key TikTok sensation documenting the renovation. Now Martin’s cooking videos are getting a following too. The food is sharp but unfussy, with a focus on locally landed fish and seafood through the summer. Prime tables sit across the road with views over the river Arigideen. CH Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. CH When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. JC A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu. CH Situated on Cork’s historic Cornmarket, David Devereaux and Anne Zagar’s small restaurant has become known in the city for exacting classic cooking executed with local ingredients on a seasonal menu that changes weekly. Start with Anne’s home-made brown bread and burned onion butter, followed by unctuous duck liver parfait with spring Cork asparagus, anchovy and crispy egg followed by monkfish grilled on the bone finished with ‘nduja cream. JC Bastible continues to stand proud on Dublin’s Leonard’s Corner, serving its unique Irish take on Nordic-style cuisine. Under owner Barry Fitzgerald and chef Killian Walsh, the clean, crisp cooking is sprinkled with rich notes. Think crab tartlet with fermented sweetcorn and tart grape juice, grilled sika deer with the glossiest port jus or a creamy mushroom custard made with mushrooms grown right across the road. JC When most Michelin-starred places are heading for three figures before you’ve ordered a drink, this one still turns out three courses at lunch and early-bird for €50. Garrett Byrne’s food is rooted in the classics – ravioli of hand-dived scallop with fennel butter sauce, pancetta royale of Challans duck with spiced greengage purée, grilled octopus with braised chickpeas, Hereford beef with ox cheek croquette and green peppercorn salsa. Great ingredients, great cooking, great value. CH You don’t expect one of the country’s best set menus to come out of a 15th-century building in Waterford, but Peter Everett cooks with precision and care. Lunch is €38, pre-theatre €41, dinner €55 – for proper dishes like soft-boiled free-range egg with toasted brioche and cheese and onion cream, Wexford scallops with lentils and garlic sausage, and fillet of hake with smoked bacon, cabbage and potato. Eight outdoor seats sit under an awning, with heaters primed for Irish summers. CH At Lignum, Danny Africano leads a kitchen where every plate passes over kiln-dried birch, ash and oak, threading smoke through some of the country’s most precise cooking, while his wife, Molly Keane, runs front of house. The €145, 10-course tasting menu has included Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan, red mullet and gambero rosso pasta, and wild venison just barely kissed by flame. A €70 five-course lunch runs at weekends. The Michelin star finally landed in 2025 – three years later than it should have. CH Big windows flood Ox with light, but the real draw is Stephen Toman’s cooking – precise, inventive, and rooted in the seasons. Refurbished in 2023, the calm, understated room sets the stage for a kitchen quietly recognised as one of the sharpest on the island. Expect dishes like smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic, or lobster brightened with broad beans and lemon grass, while Alain Kerloc’h’s smart wine pairings pull it all together. CH In case the name hasn’t already given the game away, a parrilla grill sits at the heart of this Ranelagh restaurant. From restaurateur Jules Mak and head chef Hector Ochoa, charcoal flavour is infused into as many dishes as possible, from grilled half chicken in arbol and habanero sauce to caramelised pineapple with pickled onion and tangy tajin. The margarita menu is absolutely banging, especially the Verdita. JC Fidelity Studio connects to Fidelity Bar through a slick interior door, making it easy to move between beers and bao. Sister 7 – a Big Fan collaboration – serves Chinese-style tapas using Irish produce and ingredients repurposed from Whiplash Beer’s brewing waste. The dumplings and bao are solid, but the “lip sticks” – fried cakes of fermented rice, yam, tofu and celeriac – are the move. Don’t miss the Sichuan-style Irish lamb with cumin, chilli, sesame and curried chickpea popcorn. DJs keep the place buzzing. CH Laser sharp classical cooking, intense glossy sauces and innovative flavours all combined this year to land a first Michelin Star for the beautiful Morrison Room. It has been achieved under the leadership of local man Adam Nevin, who learned his craft at spots such as The Hand and Flowers in Buckinghamshire and The Grill at the Dorchester in London. Expect much, much more from this modest, immensely talented chef. JC When Gwen McGrath and Ken Doherty recently announced the reopening of Dublin’s smallest restaurant, there was much rejoicing. This time out they accept bookings, much to the relief of those who struggled to get tables before, and there’s also wine to accompany lunch. Small sharing plates of smoky aubergine, calf’s liver with fenugreek butter, and radicchio dressed with guanciale fat epitomise the eclectic Italian influence for which this cosy spot is much loved. JC Mickael Viljanen’s Chapter One isn’t just Ireland’s best restaurant – it’s one of the best anywhere, and not just for the two-Michelin-star, €90 three-course lunch. At a recent meal, a parade of canapés (warm mushroom beignet, pissaladière hidden in transparent pastry) was followed with Loire Valley asparagus, wild turbot, Anjou pigeon and razor-sharp desserts. Bookings open quarterly – next round June 24th at 9.30am for September–October. Tables for two go first; fours have more chance. Get on the waiting list now and sign up for the newsletter. CH Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola have stripped things back at their Victorian town house seafood spot in Tramore, now running a casual Fish & Chips Café on the ground floor. Light beer-battered fish – John Dory, haddock, whiting – leads the menu, backed by daily specials like Woodstown Bay oysters, Boatstrand crab salad and Roaring Water Bay mussel curry. It operates as a diningroom from Friday to Sunday. The wine list is as impressive as ever, and organic and biodynamic wines are poured by the glass, bottle or carafe. CH There are dishes at Goldie that make you want to eat nothing but seafood for the rest of your life. Aisling Moore’s creativity seems to know no bounds, creating pâté made from local meaty Rossmore oysters, Mexican-inspired pibil monk cheek sope or pan-fried megrim with cafe de Paris butter. There are generous mounds of crushed colcannon for sides and a modern wine selection available by the glass, carafe or bottle. JC Grano is one of Dublin’s hardest reservations to secure, but it’s worth it if you want pasta excellence. All pasta is made fresh every day, using flour from an ancient Italian grain grown by owner Roberto Mungo himself. New additions to the menu include cappellacci stuffed with slow-cooked beef and onion, romanesco artichoke ravioli, and spaghetti with asparagus, saltwort and Calabrian chilli breadcrumbs. Ask for recommendations from the all-Italian wine list. JC When a meal starts with a chunk of potato focaccia, carbonara butter and guanciale, you might justifiably feel that you’re in good hands. At Kicky’s, chef Eric Matthews and team will take you through a spectrum from refined to indulgent. Think mussels bound lightly in taramasalata with smoked eel and kohlrabi, wild brill cooked over charcoal or rabbit Bolognese. Make sure to finish with Audrey Cahatol’s signature Irish Coffee dessert. JC Kevin Burke’s restaurant is one of Dublin’s toughest reservations, and for good reason. The room fizzes with energy and the food is smart, focused and inventive. The choux with horseradish and Cantabrian anchovy has been there since day one. Small plates include marinated peppers with salsa verde and kohlrabi, followed by a tranche of turbot with jus gras, sorrel and Béarnaise. The wine list, put together by ace sommelier and restaurant manager Ann-Marie Duignam, is just as sharp. Book via their website – and if only 5pm shows, email for cancellations. CH Variety Jones has finally settled into its new home at the junction of Thomas Street and Francis Street. The attractive high windows allow passersby to gaze in at the kitchen and chef Keelan Higgs at the pass. This is exactly what a neighbourhood Michelin restaurant should be, with a tasting menu that combines comfort and fine dining. The old premises a few doors down will reopen soon as a wine bar. JC Always evolving, Niall Davidson’s allta is returning to a tasting menu format for lunchtime and dinner which is designed to showcase the restaurant’s journey over the years from Library Place, Setanta Street and now the Dublin docklands. With an unwavering commitment to Irish produce in the main restaurant and the buzzy allta bar, the punchy wood-fired cooking is well worth the trip. JC Ever since reopening, Coppinger has captured the buzzy and fun vibes of the original venue. Listen to the cocktails shaking while you browse the Mediterranean-inspired menu which uses the best of Irish ingredients over a barbecue grill. Everything is delicious, especially when it’s the incredible value “menú del día,” available Wednesday-Friday, which offers two courses for €15 or three for €20. Where else would you get it? JC Small plates, bigger tables, better chairs – Daróg in Galway has sharpened up without losing its edge. The cooking leans into smoke and charcoal, from grilled white asparagus with lovage hollandaise to dry-aged lamb with confit leek and swede. There’s a five-course tasting menu at €55, or you can build your own from the blackboard, where more than 40 wines by the glass change weekly. Run by Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon, with Attila Galambos on fire in the kitchen. CH There are two main features to the diningroom at Elbow Lane, the open charcoal grill right in the middle, and the stainless steel microbrewery tanks to the rear. Put simply, it’s all about the grilling and the beer here, although the cocktails are pretty damn good also. Start with the intensely flavoured pork belly with fish sauce caramel, followed by the signature slow-smoked baby back ribs or wood-grilled steaks. JC Flame-finished mains hold their own at this neighbourhood spot. Andarl Farm pork belly, crisped and tender, pairs with radicchio and hazelnuts, while monkfish is perfectly charred. For €29, the prix fixe (5–6pm Wed–Fri) offers a snack, main, and glass of wine – perfect pre-cinema. Otherwise, settle in for grilled lamb or free-range chicken, all cooked over live fire. CH At Mister S, they proudly state that all mains are cooked over charcoal and wood. But, to be honest, every piece of produce that enters the kitchen is in danger of finding itself over the glowing embers. The smell of smoke permeates the entire room and everything is delicious, from charred leeks with romesco and smoked mozzarella, to piri piri chicken, or their incredible beef sourced from Co Donegal. Everything gets a turn on the embers. JC Cooked over live fire on an Ox grill – tomahawk steaks, Black Angus chateaubriand, and porterhouse steaks are the stars, with pizzas from a full pizza oven and flatbreads to round it out. The recently renovated “secret garden” provides a relaxed outdoor setting. Set menus (€34.50 for two courses, €39.50 for three) make it easy to dive into fire-cooked flavours, while a revamped cocktail bar adds a finishing touch. CH The tomahawk for two (€79) is the headline at The Fern Grill – a slab of Hereford beef, carved at the table and kissed hard by the Basque Josper grill. Seamus Commons fires Black Angus, lamb and daily fish with the same precision, but nothing matches the depth and smoke of the beef. CH Flavour is at the heart of everything that chef patron Brian Murray does. Under Darren Kennedy, the kitchen turns out smoke-kissed plates built for sharing, using local seasonal ingredients. The signature milk buns with cultured butter are mandatory, then try grilled cuttlefish with leeks and smoked aioli, or lamb saddle and belly with smoked carrots. A second live-fire restaurant, Birdsong, is coming soon to the Coal Quay. JC Denis Vaughan runs this newly refurbished spot on the prom, firing meat and shellfish over a Spanish Josper to exacting effect. The menu is tight and fire-driven: barbecued Aran Island monkfish with a hazelnut crust, roasted chicken supreme with satay crust and fregola, and aged Irish Black Angus steaks with bone marrow butter, beef jus and dripping chips. It’s about proper fire cooking, heavy plates and the freshest fish he can lay his hands on. CH Walking from the busy Dublin quays into the diningroom at Achara, gently fragranced with the smell of grilled meats, is like being briefly transported far away. Chef Graeme Reynolds pulls no punches, delivering authentic Thai flavours such as chicken wings in fish sauce caramel, Wagyu basil chilli beef krapao and XO mushroom larb. Check out the €15 weekday lunch menu for some of the best value in town. JC Diningroom in Castlebar has been quietly serving one of the best-value prix fixe menus in the country since 2016. €42 or €59 gets you three courses and a sorbet – brown soda bread, scallops with Kelly’s black pudding, Hereford sirloin with gratin dauphinoise, and a sticky toffee pudding that justifies the drive. Service is calm, the room is dark wood and Prussian blue, and every plate feels thoroughly composed. CH The mark of a great wine bar is shown in how they share their enthusiasm for wine with their customers, and the charming L’Atitude 51 leads the way when it comes to a calendar packed with wine tastings and food and wine pairing events. The food menu is designed for sharing, with simplicity and quality shining through. Try Macroom burrata with olive oil, radishes with anchoïade or haddock and mussel croquettes, and of course, some magnificent wines. JC In a bustling neighbourhood, this spot still delivers a solid early evening menu – two/three courses for €42/€52 – proving that early bird doesn’t have to be bland. David O’Byrne, with his Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2018, keeps the menu fresh with creative dishes like grilled sea bass with orange and kohlrabi or pan-seared halibut with fennel, shellfish, and chorizo barley broth. A five-course tasting menu is also available on the first Tuesday of each month for €72. CH [ This just might be the best-value restaurant menu in the countryOpens in new window ] It’s all systems go in Dingle for the Flannery family who have increased the number of seats at The Fish Box as well as moving the takeaway to Paddy Bawn Brosnan’s. New this summer is Fish Outside of the Box, offering lobster, crab and prawn rolls along with cocktails, wine and beer. With fish direct from their own fishing vessel and commitment to a sustainable supply chain, it’s among the country’s top seafood spots. JC Darren D’Arcy always has a perfect bottle of wine on hand to match the dishes that flow from Barry Sun’s kitchen. It’s no easy task, given Barry’s broad range of skill and flavours. Think Flaggy Shore oysters with a dab of home-made chilli oil, his signature mushroom dumplings, BBQ brill for two or a classic rum baba with strawberries. It’s worth noting that the evening neighbourhood menu offers seriously good value. JC After 20 years in business, Dax still oozes quiet class. Graham Neville’s superb classical cooking is a joy – seared Castletownbere scallops with coral bisque, Tipperary beef, and a mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb are textbook examples. Owner Olivier Meisonnave has compiled one of the country’s great wine lists – from smart biodynamic finds to serious Grand Cru. CH Since opening, Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have worked tirelessly to deliver wonderful hospitality and modern Irish cooking from their seaside restaurant. Killian uses local and Irish ingredients such as “lamb lobster” (lamb neck), Winetavern Farm pork and Howth honey to great effect. Don’t miss the iconic cod chip or their exquisite tarts. JC Recently refurbished, mrDeanes is a bistro-style restaurant that encapsulates the very best of chef Michael Deane’s 28 years in business, and this year received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. It’s exactly what a busy city bistro should be, serving up Portavogie crab on toast, entrecôte au poivre, sugar pit pork chops and fish and chips. Look out for their new own label white wine. JC Ruchii is a riot of Indian flavours and bright jewelled colours. Marinated jumbo prawns are cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven while the slow-cooked lamb shank nalli nihari is sheer warmth. Chef Sateesh Sayana also serves up authentic South Indian specialities including rava dosa, masala uttapam and a Sunday special of Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani. Read our full review here. JC John Coffey does not stand still but continues to develop, always cooking with flair. The focus here is on quality produce, resulting in a glossy golden pithivier of potato, onion and Mossfield cheddar; roast cod with cauliflower, capers and golden raisins or a dark chocolate and sesame ganache. JC The words “Asian fusion” can sometimes strike fear, but diners are in safe hands at Umi. Owners Seán Lafferty and Gary Moran have created a fun atmosphere that seamlessly marries great Irish produce with Japanese techniques. Think binchotan grilled steak or crispy dumplings made with local pork and a fiery rayu sauce. They even offer their own wine, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer.

Title: As Elon Musk Exits Washington, Tesla Investors Demand He Work 40-Hour Weeks as CEO

Now that Elon Musk has wrapped up his high-profile advisory role in Washington, a group of Tesla’s institutional investors is pressing him to return his full attention to the company, which has seen sales plummet in key markets in recent months. The investors point to slowing electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price as evidence that Tesla needs Musk back at the helm. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Yesterday (May 28), Tesla chair Robyn Denholm received a letter signed by 12 major pension funds that collectively hold significant stakes in the company. As first reported by the Financial Times, the letter calls on Musk to commit to working at least 40 hours per week at Tesla. The signatories include New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner, the American Federation of Teachers, Denmark’s AkademikerPension, and the SOC Investment Group, which collaborates with labor union pension funds to back shareholder initiatives. SOC is the investment arm of the Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of North American labor unions. “The current crisis at Tesla puts into sharp focus the long-term problems at the company stemming from the CEO’s absence, which is amplified by a Board that appears largely uninterested and unwilling to act in the best interest of all Tesla shareholders by demanding Musk’s full-time attention on Tesla,” the letter said. The investors’ letter arrives as Tesla’s board reportedly weighs a new compensation plan for Musk, after a Delaware court struck down his controversial $56 billion pay package in 2023. The pension funds argue that any new agreement should come with a condition that that Musk commit to working at least 40 hours a week at Tesla. “Given Musk’s leadership roles at four private companies and his foundation, the Board must ensure that Tesla is not treated as just one among many competing obligations,” the letter said. Aside from Tesla, he partially owns and runs at least five other companies, including SpaceX, X, The Boring Company, Neuralink and xAI. Musk recently promised to refocus on Tesla and scale back his role as the head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla . . . as we have critical technologies rolling out,” he wrote on X earlier this month. Musk is the largest shareholder of Tesla, owning about 13 percent of the company. Its other major shareholders include institutional funds such as Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. Because Tesla is part of the S&P 500 index (since December 2020), many pension funds that invest in index funds also own shares in Tesla. The signatories of this week’s letter collectively hold about 0.25 percent of Tesla, worth roughly $3 billion. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Ethereum ETF inflows hit $71M – Could $2,900 be ETH’s next target?

ETH also leads in stablecoin growth, showing institutional confidence. Ethereum [ETH] is staging a quiet comeback. After months of capital outflows and narrative drift, ETH is once again drawing investor attention; this time with institutional weight behind it. ETH is regaining dominance with $71.3 million in recent ETF inflows, a spike in bridged net flows, and stablecoin supply growth. As capital rotates back into the network, signs suggest institutional accumulation, coinciding with shifting broader market dynamics. Source: X BlackRock alone accounted for $32.5 million, showing its position as a frontrunner in institutional ETH accumulation. The ETHA and FETH-led inflows reflect strong confidence from major asset managers as capital rotates back into Ethereum. This positive shift follows net positive flows in the third week of May, despite earlier volatility from outflows by Fidelity and Franklin. Source: Artemis Recent Artemis data reveals that Ethereum outperformed all networks in bridged net flows and stablecoin supply growth. Ethereum recorded the largest net inflow of assets across bridges alongside a sharp increase in stablecoin issuance, signaling renewed liquidity and capital confidence. This dual lead suggests rising usage and demand across DeFi protocols, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as crypto’s foundational Layer 1. Ethereum traded at around $2,708 at press time, approaching recent local highs with bullish momentum. The RSI climbed to 70.47, at the edge of overbought territory, showing strong buying pressure, but also the potential for short-term consolidation. CMF remained positive at 0.15, indicating steady capital inflows. Source: TradingView If ETH closes above $2,720 with sustained volume, a breakout toward $2,900 becomes plausible. However, one must watch for signs of fatigue as the RSI nears critical levels. For now, the trend remains bullish, but overextension risks a short-term pullback or ranging pause.

Title: Bitcoin low volatility fuels BlackRock’s IBIT 31-day inflow run and $72B asset surge

BlackRock’s IBIT establishes dominance in ETF market, ranks top five by year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted consistent capital for over a month, signaling sustained institutional interest in the top crypto. According to data from SoSoValue, IBIT has recorded 31 consecutive trading days without net outflows since April 14. The only exception was May 13, when flows remained flat. Despite that pause, the ETF has received $9.31 billion in net inflows during the ongoing streak, which has propelled the fund’s assets under management to roughly $72 billion. ETF Store President Nate Geraci pointed out that IBIT now ranks among the top five ETFs by year-to-date inflows across a universe of more than 4,200 US-listed funds. Market observers point to declining volatility and improving market sentiment as key drivers behind IBIT’s appeal. Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas noted that the fund’s 90-day rolling volatility has reached its lowest level since inception. This trend, paired with Bitcoin’s steady price gains, is drawing in larger asset allocators. Balchunas highlighted that IBIT’s flow dominance in recent weeks significantly outpaces other crypto-related ETFs, suggesting it has become the go-to choice for institutional players seeking Bitcoin exposure without excessive risk. Investment manager Mike Shell of ASYMMETRY added that IBIT is beginning to behave more like a mature, institutional-grade asset. According to him, the asset is not acting like a speculative crypto token but more like a digital store of value, like gold, than volatile tech stocks. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

The Harvard Control Grid showed their framework of control. Now … lets see the Ivy Web. The End of Illusion Begins in Cambridge For over a century, Harvard University sat at the center of the Western world’s intellectual web - an elite fortress cloaked in prestige, draped in crimson, and entrusted with shaping presidents, policy, and public trust. But that trust was built on illusion. The recent cascade of revelations, liquidations, and criminal convictions has exposed something far darker: Harvard was never just a school. It was a global command node - a soft power empire cloaked in academia, now caught in a storm of treason, foreign subversion, and ethical collapse. From hosting sanctioned Chinese military-linked officials, to funding research in Wuhan through convicted felons, to concealing billions in foreign funds, Harvard’s once-pristine image has collapsed under the weight of its own deception. The dominoes are still falling. Financial Desperation - The Billion-Dollar Fire Sale As reported in Wilted Ivy, Harvard began selling off more than $1 billion in illiquid private equity holdings - not to rebalance its endowment, but to stay afloat. According to public filings and insider leaks, the Harvard Management Company (HMC) was offloading stakes in vehicles managed by Blackstone, KKR, and Bain Capital. This wasn’t a strategy shift. It was distress liquidation. Business Insider reported in January 2024 that Harvard’s liquidation was mirrored by major institutional partners, including Goldman Sachs and even BlackRock itself. These were not isolated decisions. They were a coordinated exit, a sign that something massive had shifted in the financial and ideological infrastructure beneath the Ivy League. This collapse traces back to Executive Orders 13818 and 13848, signed by President Trump in 2017 and 2018 respectively, creating the legal framework for the seizure of assets connected to corruption, election interference, and foreign subversion. These weren’t symbolic gestures. They were trapdoors. ..MORE TOPICS: Education; History; Society KEYWORDS: harvard 1 posted on 05/29/2025 1:47:33 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: null and void; aragorn; EnigmaticAnomaly; kalee; Kale; AZ .44 MAG; Baynative; bgill; bitt; ...

CAMBRIDGE, MA — With the Trump administration banning Harvard University from taking international students, the school was forced to begin accepting students from Ohio. “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” said Harvard Dean of Admissions Phil Donahue. “I never thought we would fall so far. I’ve spent my entire life trying to never even speak to someone from Ohio, much less allow them into Harvard. This is rock bottom.” With international students unable to attend and hundreds of admissions slots to fill, the University began considering what was once unthinkable: allowing human beings from the Midwest on campus. “Maybe we can let someone from Illinois in. Do they speak English there? I’m not familiar,” said Don Harmon, Vice Dean of Admissions. “I suppose these students will want to bring their chickens and hay to the dorm, I believe that’s what these people like. Appalling. This feels like inviting baboons to a royal wedding.” Despite its best efforts, Harvard remained unable to fill its final slots and ultimately made the difficult decision to begin accepting students from Ohio. “We have to face reality. We have to face Ohio,” said Donahue. “After centuries of keeping Harvard Ohio-less, today we are mailing our first acceptance letters to Columbus. I’m literally throwing up in my mouth saying it.” At publishing time, the students in Ohio had laughed heartily for hours at the idea that any of them would ever want to go to Harvard over Ohio State. 11 posted on 05/30/2025 3:38:17 AM PDT by UMCRevMom@aol.com (Please pray for God 's intervention to stop Putin's invasion of Ukraine 🇺🇸) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 10 | View Replies] To: UMCRevMom@aol.com human beings from the Midwest The author is getting ahead of its beeing here. 12 posted on 05/30/2025 4:54:49 AM PDT by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

CAMBRIDGE, MA — With the Trump administration banning Harvard University from taking international students, the school was forced to begin accepting students from Ohio. “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” said Harvard Dean of Admissions Phil Donahue. “I never thought we would fall so far. I’ve spent my entire life trying to never even speak to someone from Ohio, much less allow them into Harvard. This is rock bottom.” With international students unable to attend and hundreds of admissions slots to fill, the University began considering what was once unthinkable: allowing human beings from the Midwest on campus. “Maybe we can let someone from Illinois in. Do they speak English there? I’m not familiar,” said Don Harmon, Vice Dean of Admissions. “I suppose these students will want to bring their chickens and hay to the dorm, I believe that’s what these people like. Appalling. This feels like inviting baboons to a royal wedding.” Despite its best efforts, Harvard remained unable to fill its final slots and ultimately made the difficult decision to begin accepting students from Ohio. “We have to face reality. We have to face Ohio,” said Donahue. “After centuries of keeping Harvard Ohio-less, today we are mailing our first acceptance letters to Columbus. I’m literally throwing up in my mouth saying it.” At publishing time, the students in Ohio had laughed heartily for hours at the idea that any of them would ever want to go to Harvard over Ohio State. 11 posted on 05/30/2025 3:38:17 AM PDT by UMCRevMom@aol.com (Please pray for God 's intervention to stop Putin's invasion of Ukraine 🇺🇸) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 10 | View Replies] To: UMCRevMom@aol.com human beings from the Midwest The author is getting ahead of its beeing here. 12 posted on 05/30/2025 4:54:49 AM PDT by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.
