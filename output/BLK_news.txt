Title: Goldman Trades Billions in Thames Water Debt as Hedge Funds Buy

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has executed around £3 billion ($4 billion) of trades in Thames Water’s bonds in September, as it makes a market between original investors exiting the beleaguered utility and opportunistic players scooping up the debt at a discount. Hedge funds and distressed funds are continuing to bid for the debt of the UK’s largest water provider, said dealers at the US bank in a note to clients and seen by Bloomberg on Monday. The trading comes as the company has kicked off talks with creditors as it struggles to raise equity. Worries the firm will soon run out of cash led S&P Global Inc. and Moody’s Ratings to downgrade its Class A debt — deemed the safest — by five and six notches respectively last week. They also downgraded its riskier Class B debt. “The Thames structure remains topical at GS as risk continues to change hands post downgrade,” the bank said in the note. “Selling was initially in Class B debt, but more recently we’ve been sellers of Class A risk as well.” Buyers are favoring the more illiquid and lower cash price paper, as the market difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated bonds flattens, the note added. Companies with large amounts of debt often have bonds with wildly differing cash prices because notes are issued over multiple years at different points in the rate cycle. Goldman Sachs has also been trading some of Thames’s bank debt, with £145 million changing hands via its desk since April, according to the note. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. S&P sees a debt restructuring — and consequently a default — as likely in the coming 12 months. The company has said it does not expect to receive funds in the form of equity ahead of a final determination by regulator Ofwat, expected at the earliest on Dec. 19. Thames has been negotiating with a group of creditors holding £10 billion of the company’s Class A debt over options to delay a potential liquidity shortfall. The group of creditors — including investors from BlackRock Inc. and Elliott Investment Management — has been working on its own plan to address the need for new funds and the unsustainable debt pile.

Title: BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes

The asset management behemoth's private markets arm has seen off competition from rival bidders in a deal likely to be worth more than £300m, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 30 September 2024 17:39, UK An arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is closing in on a takeover of a major contractor to Thames Water even as the utility teeters on the brink of collapse. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock's private markets division could strike a deal to acquire Lanes Group, which is based in Leeds, within days. City insiders said that BlackRock had seen off competition from other suitors. It was unclear on Monday how much the asset management behemoth had agreed to pay for Lanes Group, although Sky News reported last month that the contractor was valued at up to £350m. BlackRock has begun to play an increasingly active role as a bidder in processes populated by conventional private equity firms. Lanes Group provides wastewater and drainage services, and generates a significant chunk of its revenues from Thames Water alongside other major water utilities. The industry is under intense pressure from the new Labour government, industry regulator Ofwat and other stakeholders amid public anger over wastage and pollution levels. Thames Water is battling to avoid temporary nationalisation as it faces running out of money within months unless it can raise additional funding. Sky News reported at the weekend that advisers to the utility, which has about 15m customers, have added Carlyle, the private equity firm, to a list of potential rescue investors. Blackrock declined to comment.

Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek. Hear from experts at TIME, Peloton, YouTube, Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register. Will it take a maximum effort for Ryan Reynolds to go public? MNTN, the connected TV advertising platform where Reynolds serves as chief creative officer, tapped Morgan Stanley to explore a potential initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. The IPO could take place as soon as early next year, according to Bloomberg, with ongoing discussions being held about matters such as its timing and whether more financial institutions will participate. MNTN provides software that enables brands to create and manage ad campaigns on CTV platforms, highlighted by its MNTN Performance TV platform, a suite of automated optimization technology, measurement, and targeting tools. After collaborating on the first two Deadpool films, Reynolds and George Dewey formed Maximum Effort Marketing in 2018, and its campaigns for another Reynolds venture, Aviation Gin, fueled the agency’s rise to prominence. In June 2021, MNTN agreed to acquire Maximum Effort, permitting it to retain its identity as a creative agency within the MNTN portfolio, retaining Dewey as Maximum Effort’s president, and naming Reynolds CCO of MNTN. Dewey told ADWEEK shortly after the deal was announced, “The biggest benefit is cultural. We wanted to grow, but not in a way where it meant adding layers and pitches and processes that can sometimes take the joy and speed out of marketing.” The company raised $119 million in a Series D financing round in 2021, according to Bloomberg, co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management & Research. MNTN added three members to its board of directors in March 2023 to help it manage the company’s growth: retired accountant Joe B. Johnson, Code.org founder and CEO Hadi Partovi, and Deep Sync CEO Grant Ries. Jay Stevens joined the company in June 2023 as general manager, international, after serving as president of omnichannel media buying and media accounting software company Hudson MX.

Time Published: 2024-09-30T15:48:37Z
Full Content:
In recent market activity, Saba Capital Management, L.P., a notable ten percent owner of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), has increased its position in the company through a series of stock purchases. On September 26 and 27, Saba Capital acquired a total of 49,504 shares, with the transaction value amounting to approximately $782,788. The purchases were made at prices ranging from $15.81 to $15.89 per share. Following these transactions, the investment firm now holds a total of 20,653,378 shares in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust. This move by Saba Capital Management demonstrates a growing interest in the health sciences-focused trust, which may be of interest to investors monitoring the sector. Boaz Weinstein, associated with Saba Capital as a ten percent owner, also has a stake in these transactions, aligning with the investment firm's activities. The accumulation of shares by significant owners such as Saba Capital Management often signals a strong belief in the company's future prospects or undervaluation. Investors and market watchers alike may find these purchases noteworthy as they reflect the actions of experienced market participants with substantial knowledge of the company. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, traded on the NYSE under the ticker BMEZ, represents an investment opportunity within the health sciences sector, which continues to garner attention amidst ongoing innovations and developments. The recent share purchases by Saba Capital Management in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights provided by InvestingPro. BMEZ currently boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.4%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BMEZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." This generous dividend policy might be a factor attracting large investors like Saba Capital. The trust's market capitalization stands at $1.69 billion, with a P/E ratio of 25.31. While this P/E ratio might seem elevated, it's important to consider it in the context of the health sciences sector, which often commands higher valuations due to growth potential. Interestingly, BMEZ has shown strong performance over the past year, with a 20.16% price total return. The trust is also trading at 95.96% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its share price. This positive momentum could be another factor influencing Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. However, investors should note that InvestingPro Tips also highlight some potential concerns. The trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may warrant closer examination by potential investors. For those interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights that could provide a fuller picture of BMEZ's investment potential.

Title: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi

Since their approval in January 2024, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been steadily gaining traction in the United States, with the issuers buying hundreds of thousands of BTC as their popularity spread. This has led to a large stash of BTC by these issuers as BlackRock leads the charge. Given their buying spree so far, the number of BTC being held by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been rising and is almost at the 1 million mark, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a total of 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading back in January 2024. Now, only eight months later, these ETFs have managed to acquire more than 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Combined, this makes the Spot Bitcoin ETFs some of the largest BTC holders. So far, the BlackRock IBIT has been one of the largest buyers of BTC, surpassing even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had a 600,000 BTC head start. Currently, Grayscale holds more than 350,000 BTC, making the firm a top Bitcoin holder. Grayscale is still in second place when it comes to the number of BTC held. However, the Bitcoin fund has recorded more outflows than inflows since January, losing more than half of its stash before the Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Now, Grayscale holds less than 250,000 BTC after losing more than $20 billion to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs due to their lower fees. Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs such as the Fidelity FBTC and the Ark Invest/21Shares ARKB has reached almost 50,000 BTC. So far, the funds have been able to garner 924,768 BTC, putting their total holdings very close to the 1 million BTC milestone. In total, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs now boast 4.685 of the total Bitcoin supply. The top Bitcoin wallet with the largest BTC holdings still remains the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet with 1.1 million BTC in it. However, this wallet has been long dormant, and often left out of the top Bitcoin wallets list due to its inactivity. According to the BitInfoCharts website, topping the Bitcoin rich list is the Binance old wallet with 248,598 BTC worth over $16.3 billion. Next is the Bitfinex Hack Recovery wallet with 94,643 BTC, with $6.2 billion. The Mt Gox Hack wallet holds 79,957 BTC for the third-largest at $5.2 billion. The wallet holding the BTC confiscated from the Silk Road bust with 69,370 BTC is in fourth position worth $4.56 billion, and the Binance BTCB Reserve wallet has 68,200 BTC in it, worth $4.49 billion.

Title: Bitcoin dominance drives $1.2B inflows in crypto investment products

Ethereum ended its five-week outflow streak with $87 million inflow. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Inflows into crypto-related investment products continued for the third consecutive week, with $1.2 billion flowing into the sector, according to CoinShares’ latest weekly report. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research, attributed the strong inflows to expectations of a dovish US monetary policy and positive market momentum. These factors pushed total assets under management up 6.2% to $92.7 billion. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved options trading for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which also lifted market sentiment. Despite these inflows, weekly trading volume in the sector dipped by 3.1%. Bitcoin’s dominance continues The CoinShares report showed that Bitcoin continued to dominate the flows, with investors pouring in $1 billion to BTC-related investment products. This can be linked to its strong price performance and also the improved inflows to spot Bitcoin ETF products last week. Notably, the funds run by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark 21 Shares all saw positive performance during the reporting period. However, Grayscale’s crypto funds continued their net outflow trend, dropping its total assets to $21.2 billion. Meanwhile, BTC’s recent uptrend to around $65,000 fueled an $8.8 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, as some investors expect the current rally to fade. Regionally, sentiment was divided. The US led with $1.2 billion in inflows, while Switzerland trailed with $84 million. In contrast, Germany and Brazil experienced outflows of $21 million and $3 million, respectively. Ethereum-related products ended a five-week outflow streak, bringing in $87 million—the first significant inflow since early August. Data from SosoValue showed that spot Ethereum ETFs saw the second-highest weekly flows since their launch in July. On the other hand, large-cap alternative digital assets had mixed results. Litecoin and XRP recorded inflows of $2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana and Binance faced outflows of $4.8 million and $1.2 million. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The Billion-Dollar AI Gamble: Data Centers As The New High-Stakes Game

Full Content:
High-tech Data Centers Powering Critical AI And Digital Applications Require Careful And Intense ... [+] Planning. In today’s hyper-connected world, data centers have become the nerve centers of our digital economy. Hyperscale tech giants like Microsoft and global investment powerhouses like BlackRock are pooling their vast resources and pouring billions into data center construction, betting that these facilities will underpin the next wave of technological innovation. With artificial intelligence evolving at a dizzying pace, the stakes have never been higher. A prime example of this is the recent announcement of a groundbreaking 1 GW data center near Houston—an off-grid, hydrogen-powered hub designed to fuel AI. This colossal project underscores the immense scale of the high-stakes AI gamble. The U.S. government is paying close attention. The White House has created a Task Force on AI Datacenter Infrastructure to prioritize AI data center development as a matter of national security and economic interest. CEOs of the biggest data center operators and tech firms—CoreWeave, QTS, Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Anthropic—recently met with utility industry leaders to ensure that the U.S. maintains its competitive edge in AI infrastructure. But with these massive investments come immense risks. As tech investors begin to scrutinize the timing of returns on these AI ventures, it’s critical to understand the specific use cases of data centers before committing billions of dollars to their development. Data centers are not fungible or easily repurposed without massive capital expenditure. The adage “measure twice, cut once” has never been more appropriate—especially when a 100 MW facility could set you back $1.4 billion. This financial reality is why titans like Microsoft and BlackRock are joining forces to tackle these high-stakes projects in partnership, rather than going it alone. Data centers are built to handle staggering volumes of data and traffic with minimal latency, making them indispensable for a wide range of critical functions. But the design of these data centers must be closely tied to their intended use case. For instance, crypto mining prioritizes cheap power over low latency, which profoundly affects location, design, and redundancy requirements. Meanwhile, AI inference workloads require high computational power and very low latency, demanding a different approach altogether. The importance of data centers in today’s digital economy cannot be overstated—they are the lifeblood of everything from: These are just a few examples of how data centers are integrated into every corner of modern life. As digital needs continue to grow, the complexities of building and managing these facilities also expand. Building a data center is no simple task. A typical facility houses racks of physical servers, cutting-edge networking equipment, and massive storage devices—all supported by a highly redundant power and cooling infrastructure designed to ensure near-perfect uptime. Today’s data centers are increasingly reliant on smart control systems, like Data Center Infrastructure Management software, to optimize performance and energy efficiency. But data centers are not cookie-cutter solutions. They require significant upfront planning and capital. Each type of data center is designed to meet specific needs, and changing use cases down the line can have disastrous effects on long-term viability and profitability. When building or investing in a data center, understanding the different types is crucial: Data centers are also traditionally ranked by tier, based on their expected uptime and reliability: As AI and machine learning become more central to the global economy, data centers will play an even more critical role in powering our digital world. But with this expansion comes significant risk and complexity. The rapid growth in AI workloads adds pressure on data centers to deliver more computational power with lower latency, but the costs of getting it wrong are enormous. That’s why carefully assessing the intended use case of a data center before committing to construction is essential. The companies that approach data center investments strategically—by aligning technology with specific business drivers—will be the ones to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape. Those who fail to understand the nuances of data center design, construction, and operation could face enormous financial losses and miss out on the AI-driven future. One Community. Many Voices.

What does it take to be a rising star on Wall Street?If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses. Every year, Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes. Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie. Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program. Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. "Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here," Song said. While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. "I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back," Cheslin told BI. "As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds cliché." Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February. Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes. She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a "completely different market landscape." But the team pulled through and logged a record year. "Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of," she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. "Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task — I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself." Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or "sidecars," have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30. Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline. Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. "A lot of stuff has been done before," he said. "If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job." As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. "It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm," he said. Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as "secondaries." He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own — giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm. "Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves," Carper said. He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST. Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. "I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow," he said. "There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now." Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career. "The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture," Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said. In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year. "The oversight is about innovation — what's the big thing we might be missing?" Cecil said. Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not "a trader's mentality" to actually extract "a piece of alpha" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is "the expression of the things we believe about the world." He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha — and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. "There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together," he said. Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. "Becoming a named PM — it is incredible," Chen told BI. "I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group." Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in — only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed. "The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market," Chen said. Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. "They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library," she said. "I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that." White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office. "The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me," he said. "So I decided to go to school and scale that up." After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. "A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to," White said. He took "a leap of faith" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. "It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs," said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to "be your own feedback loop." "Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'" Kolwicz's parents worked in education in Warwick, New York, and though Kolwicz became an investment banker and not a teacher, he has adopted some of their characteristics. "My dad, for better or worse, anytime I asked him a question, it turned into a lesson with him," Kolwicz, a managing director in mergers and acquisitions at the elite boutique investment bank Moelis, told BI. "Sometimes, I find myself doing that a little bit too much with the people below me," he added with a laugh. "I want them to feel as invested in it from a junior level as I do from a senior level." He landed an internship at UBS in 2010 on the media and communications team. That led to a full-time job at the Swiss bank. He joined Moelis nine years ago and was elevated to the role of managing director in December. Kolwicz has advised on nearly 50 deals across various industries, collectively valued at about $125 billion. The deals span verticals from healthcare to media to energy. One of the largest deals he's advised on was last year's roughly $21 billion all-stock merger of WWE with Endeavor, the owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship. He's also been key to building Moelis' mergers business in the emerging cannabis sector. He's made a name for himself working on transactions like the $2.1 billion sale of Harvest Health & Recreation to Trulieve Cannabis Corp in 2021. The Harvest Health sale was a watershed opportunity for Kolwicz to plant his flag. He worked on the deal as an executive director before his promotion, collaborating closely with a colleague on executing the deal and presenting to the client's board every week. "The amount of experience for me to be able to do something like that" as an executive director, he said, "you don't really get it that often." Cardona approaches her often high-pressure job as a lead banker at RBC with a perspective not many on Wall Street possess. "I was illegal for 15 years of my life. I had to go through a lot of issues just getting through school," said Cardona of her move to New Jersey from Manizales, Colombia, when she was just 6 years old. "These are really big, real-world problems that I had to face on my own. So working, I would say I'm probably the most levelheaded of anyone on the team, because nothing really is that serious." Cardona worked multiple jobs to pay her way through her financial engineering degree at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. She landed a spot in RBC's 2016 summer investment-banking internship and joined the firm once she graduated. Over the past six years, she's risen from analyst to vice president. As a member of RBC's communications, media, and entertainment banking team, Cardona worked on Apollo Global Management's $5 billion acquisition of Cox Media Group in 2019, the first and largest LBO in the TV broadcasting industry. She also helped close the radio broadcasting company MediaCo's acquisition of Estrella Media earlier this year. The COVID pandemic and subsequent interest-rate hikes stalled a lot of deal flow in her coverage area, but Cardona said she has high hopes for what's in store in the next year or so. She's seeing a lot of clients and media company owners waiting for the election and interest-rate cuts to play out. She aims to be a mentor to young Latinos who aspire to go into banking. This year, she's leading a new program where she and other RBC employees will mentor 30 high schoolers from three New York City public schools. Cardona's message to other Wall Street hopefuls is to be unapologetically persistent, she said. "If I had let any doubt fill my mind in these 10 years, I would not be here. I was set up to not be here, actually." Going into energy investing was a natural choice for Stone Redding, who hails from a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth. "Growing up in Texas, you're definitely exposed to energy as an important part of the economy and the state," she said. "And the cost of energy and the form of energy are such a core part of driving the broader global economy. That was always really fascinating to me." Stone Redding started her career at Morgan Stanley's investment bank in 2013 after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin's business school. She joined TPG in 2015, working on buyouts in traditional energy such as oil and gas. She left after 2 ½ years for a promotion at Warburg Pincus but returned in 2021 to work on clean-energy deals when TPG raised its Rise Climate fund, which closed in 2022 with $7.3 billion. Over the past three years, she has been involved in five deals that total about $1.5 billion in equity, per TPG. The principal helps lead North American deals in energy transition and sustainable fuels. She executed TPG's investment in the solar-tech company Nextracker, its spinoff, and its initial public offering. Nextracker now has a market cap of $5.7 billion. Stone Redding is interested in "the picks and shovels," aka the equipment-and-services providers that benefit from renewable-energy adoption but carry less risk than energy producers. In May, TPG Rise Climate acquired Olympus Terminals, a Southern California firm that stores and distributes renewable diesel fuel, for an undisclosed amount. Clean energy spans a wide range of business models from manufacturing to software. Stone Redding said setting priorities and sticking to them is the hardest part of her job. "There's a lot of exciting things to do in our space, and we have a small but mighty team," she said. Wilson is a top credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital, overseeing nearly $5 billion in deals across some 20 transactions in her five years there. Wilson was primed early on for a life in leveraged finance thanks to some formative bonding moments with her mother over, well, bonds. She has fond memories of visiting her mom — now retired after 25 years working in municipal bonds — on the Deutsche Bank trading floor in Boston and playing around with the Bloomberg Terminal. This inspired a fascination with how companies operate and also a belief that women could succeed in the male-dominated finance industry. Years later, after graduating from Boston College in 2015, Wilson joined a mid-market credit firm as the only woman on a six-person investment team analyst class. "I didn't have any real reservations or qualms about joining an analyst class where I was the only woman," Wilson said. She moved to Blue Owl, then known as Owl Rock, as an associate in 2019 and quickly garnered trust and was given more responsibilities by senior leaders. She credits her success, in part, to her knack for fastidious preparation — anticipating the critical information a busy exec may need and having concise answers at the ready. Wilson, who was promoted to vice president in January, has helped underwrite and execute loans to firms including Inspira Financial and Worldwide Clinical Trials, and in 2020, she also took a lead role in Blue Owl's small-business lending program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided working capital to 11 borrowers. She has watched private credit's explosion into a $2 trillion market firsthand. Blue Owl's credit AUM has grown from roughly $15 billion when she joined to over $95 billion today. Even as deal sizes have ballooned — what were once $1 billion transactions are now commonly $3 billion to $5 billion or more — her approach hasn't. "Fundamentally, the job hasn't changed, but the scale and scope of opportunities has grown," Wilson said. Khosla was climbing mango trees at 12 years old in his native India long before he climbed the ranks of Wall Street to become a managing director at Goldman Sachs. "I am very much a proponent of luck and gratitude," Khosla said. "I mean this when I say it: Never in my wildest dreams did I assume I would be here, when you asked the 12-year-old boy." Today, Khosla leads the investment-grade financing and corporate derivatives business for healthcare and real estate within Goldman's global banking and markets unit. He works with clients on their financing needs and advises them on deal-specific risks — like changes to interest rates — with the goal of positioning Goldman as a "top-tier" financier to strategic clients and asset managers. Khosla said that being part of the team that rolled out Goldman's transaction-banking business, which handles cash for big corporate customers, helped distinguish him. But when asked what attribute has most contributed to his success, he pointed to the emotional — not just the technical. "Some of my most successful transactions have been where I've really doubled down on that EQ and compassion," he said, "which is to truly get to know your clients, not just as corporations, but actually as the people that they are." It's likely a big factor in his promotion to managing director in 2019. Khosla moved to the US full time in 2006 to study at Georgetown, where he landed a gig as a bank teller at the student-run Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union. Khosla became the credit union's chief financial officer and treasurer in 2008 — before he was even of legal drinking age. "I was the CFO of a $15 million balance sheet in the heart of the financial crisis," he said. He went on to join Goldman as an analyst in 2010. Away from work, Khosla, a married father of two, is passionate about improving education in the juvenile-justice system and sits on the board of the nonprofit BreakFree Education. When Dan joined Citadel Securities in 2022, he was given an ambitious mandate to establish the firm's presence in Japan. Dan, who was born in China and grew up in Japan, was mostly starting from scratch. Citadel Securities had neither Japanese clients nor an office in Japan, and Dan, one of the first hires on his team, worked mostly as a one-man show advising clients on their fixed-income trades. But as one of the largest foreign holders of US Treasurys with more than $1 trillion in holdings, Japan represented an untapped gold rush for Ken Griffin's market maker. Citadel Securities now has trading relationships with at least 30 top fixed-income firms in Japan, Dan said, covering nearly all the major investment firms in the country. As a senior vice president of fixed-income sales, Dan offers his perspective on the economy and market moves to Japanese banks, asset managers, pensions, and life insurance companies. From his home base in New York, he acts as a sounding board for clients' investment ideas to ultimately win more trades for Citadel Securities. Before Citadel Securities, Dan spent the prior 10 years fostering relationships with Japanese financial institutions for Deutsche Bank, where he worked on the fixed-income sales team. Becoming a part of clients' everyday routines has also helped Dan grow market share. Dan usually starts and ends his day the same way: on the phone with his clients. He gives them market updates every day over the phone; for some key clients, that's been the case for the last five years, he said. "Consistency is key. I think no matter what you do," Dan said, "do it every day so that clients remember you, and then it becomes their custom to read your comments." DiGia is a professional investor who has supported roughly $1 billion worth of investments during his time at General Atlantic. In some ways, he's also a professional taste tester. As a vice president who leads food-and-beverage investing and focuses on restaurant franchising and apparel, his love of food has become an important part of his job. "I love trying new brands and new restaurants, and the thought of working with brands that I'm a consumer of every day was really appealing," DiGia, who joined General Atlantic after spending two years as an investment banker on JPMorgan's consumer and retail team, said. "But I didn't realize how exciting the job could be on the investing side." At General Atlantic, an investment in the Austin chain Torchy's Tacos turned every fast-casual lunch into a case study, with DiGia often asking staff about the business' operations. He left General Atlantic for a short stint in 2020 to get an MBA at Stanford, though he didn't get far. He interned with his old portfolio company, European Wax Center, assisting in the chain's 2022 IPO. He now sits on the boards of Joe and the Juice, Restore Hyper Wellness, and Athletic Brewing. While DiGia's tastes might influence his investments, becoming a shareholder of Athletic Brewing actually altered them. Athletic Brewing is the top-selling beer, alcoholic or otherwise, at Whole Foods Market, DiGia said. Athletic's success and the rapid growth of the nonalcoholic beverage category, compared with a flatter trajectory for traditional beer, prompted General Atlantic to lead a $50 million equity financing. When DiGia began working on the deal, he didn't have much of an interest in nonalcoholic beer. But now, he fits them into his social life, replacing his usual drink during a work dinner. Elliott was Bank of America's top vice president globally in interest-rate sales last year, generating nearly $30 million from large hedge-fund clients — production more in line with directors and managing directors. There's no obvious connection between Elliott's background and his ascendance in Bank of America's global markets division. How does food services and catering experience translate into elite hedge-fund sales? Elliott grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the son of two small-business entrepreneurs. His father ran a cleaning business and his mother a catering company, which meant a tenacious approach to work "was just kind of drilled into me — the idea of outworking everyone else in order to shine, in order to get visibility," he said. That ethic helped him earn his first internship in high school when the CEO of a food-procurement corporation saw Elliott's hustle at one of his mother's catering jobs and offered him an opportunity typically reserved for college students. Wall Street didn't emerge as a career path until the summer before his sophomore year at Duke when he attended a Bank of America diversity summit. "It was terrifying because I knew nothing about finance, but it was amazing to see senior people who looked like me could succeed on Wall Street," Elliott said. He didn't let lack of expertise discourage him from a great opportunity, studying to get up to speed after the bank offered him a summer internship. "I didn't have the most technical finance background, but I did consider myself, in most rooms I'd go into, the hardest worker." But success serving hedge funds requires savvy, not just intensity. Elliott said he treats every client meeting or dinner as if it's the most important moment of the day, and he comes armed with strategies and ideas that cut against the grain. "You don't want to be a salesperson that always agrees with the client," Elliott said. "You want to have different perspectives for them to analyze." Elliott also helps further the company diversity efforts that once helped him, including serving as recruiting cochair for Bank of America's group committed to developing and engaging African American leaders. Rooney, a sub-portfolio manager at the multistrategy hedge fund Eisler Capital, literally took an off-the-beaten-path route to his current role. While Rooney and Eisler declined to comment on this story, the 27-year-old investor told his former Citadel colleague Michael Watson about his circuitous journey to investing last year on the latter's podcast. Growing up in Ohio, Rooney said he didn't finish high school, choosing instead to bounce around jobs, including leading wilderness trips. While leading a canoeing trip in Canada, he met a college administrator who told him to get in touch if he wanted to return to school. He ended up at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied math and statistics and interned for the agriculture trading shop Louis Dreyfus. He said a senior trader told him hedge funds would try to woo him but that he should ignore their pitches for a steadier career at a place like Dreyfus — unless it was Citadel on the other line. "I didn't even know who Citadel was at the time," Rooney, who promptly went to the firm's careers website and applied to be a commodities trader, said. Nowadays, he knows that "no 23-year-old is a portfolio manager at any hedge fund, much less Citadel." But he was hired as an associate after a long Zoom call with an agricultural trading executive at the firm and told to dive into livestock trading. He taught himself how to code in Python and added biofuels to his remit during his more than two years working for Ken Griffin before joining Eisler in October 2022. He now trades derivatives across different asset classes at Eisler's New York office but still has his wilderness experience in the back of his mind. "If there's a thunderstorm and you're in the middle of a 20-mile-wide lake, you got to get to shore," he told Watson. Rooney said it gives "you a real appreciation of the fact that random stuff can happen, and there's real risk imbued in that randomness." No workday for Williams has been the same for nearly a decade. Williams was the first hire by the activist lawyer David Rosewater for Morgan Stanley's new shareholder activism and corporate defense team in 2015. Since then, Williams has worked for General Motors as the automaker beat back proposals from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital to create two classes of stock and Bristol Myers Squibb, which came under attack from the activist Starboard Value over its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019. "I always have loved the strategic aspect of it," she said. "There is no typical theme; there is no typical evolution. Each client is different." Defense is in her blood — her father's a retired vice admiral in the Navy, and her brother is a US Naval Academy graduate. While she considered the same path for herself, she didn't see herself becoming an officer for the long term. Instead, she gets to do "my own version of defense, in finance." "My parents tell everyone I'm still in the family defense business," she said. Her focus is on keeping Morgan Stanley's well-regarded team among the industry's leaders while also "constantly evolving." While the big-name activism campaigns and contentious proxy fights get the most headlines, she relishes working with companies on their strategies preemptively. "Every situation is incredibly unique," Williams, who has worked on hundreds of different defense strategies over the years, said. "You help them think through and plan how they can control their own destiny," she added. Zhu joined Blackstone in 2015 as the company was raising $4.5 billion for its second energy fund. Since then, Zhu has helped mentor a team that has grown to more than 30. And in the past year, he's worked on more than $2 billion in energy-transition investments. Zhu invests in assets that support renewable-energy adoption. He's worked on acquisitions of companies that will be central to upgrading the electric grid, including Blackstone's 2021 deal for Sabre Industries, which manufactures steel utility poles and towers, and its 2023 acquisition of Power Grid Components, which makes safety devices for substations. Zhu grew up with his grandparents in China, but at 17, he decided to challenge himself by applying to college in the US. He didn't speak English at the time but was accepted to the University of Guam, one of the few places that would take him without an SAT score. From there, a postgraduate business course helped him get into Duke's Fuqua School of Business. He then spent two years working in energy investment banking at BMO Capital Markets, where he realized he was more interested in working on the tangible versus the theoretical. He said he's so drawn to why things happen and the factors that make up people's lives and communities that he sometimes wonders if he should've majored in sociology or psychology. It's a big reason he enjoys working in energy transition: The real assets he helps buy can make a difference to people around the world. While he was negotiating a deal for the backup power company Trystar earlier this year, Texas experienced a catastrophic seven-day power outage. Zhu quickly saw how the company's growth could make an impact. "The benefit would be incredibly tangible and would impact a lot of lives," he said. Eid-Holm considers himself a "social nerd." The 32-year-old is a principal at Ares Infrastructure Opportunities, a $12 billion arm of the Los Angeles-based alternative asset manager Ares Management, where he focuses on digital assets, including data centers. "I'm a math person, but I also like to talk to people," Eid-Holm said. That flexibility comes in handy in a business that sits at a complicated intersection between real estate and the utility and technology industries. "Often the hardest part of getting a project off the ground is not an engineering problem; it's getting the right permits, working with the community," Eid-Holm said. Data-center development is booming, driven in large part by the proliferating need for the computing power and storage necessary to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence. Eid-Holm has helped Ares push into the asset class, including an undisclosed investment by the company in Prime Data Centers, a prominent data center developer and operator. As power has been exhausted on the grid, Eid-Holm has had to get creative. "Traditionally, the utility would build all the transmission lines and a substation next to the data center," Eid-Holm said. "We're increasingly seeing an opportunity/requirement for the developer to take on more and more of that role." Eid-Holm said he began to notice investment opportunities in the data-center space in the mid-2010s when he was a young executive at Deutsche Bank. "One deal the first year became two deals the next year became my full-time job," he said. "For me, it's been: Work very hard, and lean into good opportunities." Eid-Holm was raised in Ottawa and came to New York to work in finance after graduating from the University of Waterloo. He has a fiancé and said he often reads books "directly or tangentially related to my job" in his free time. "I'm very passionate about what I do," he said. "I work too hard for it to be only about financial results." Gilbert's first foray into finance was a flop. "I vividly remember going into my first interview with Barclays, and I totally bombed the interview," he said. "I have joked that the interviewer pulled out his phone five minutes into the interview and was replying to work emails." But growing up as a competitive athlete, playing everything from basketball and soccer to being a double black belt in karate, Gilbert was conditioned to try to rebound from the losses. "It was, kind of, the kick in the ass that I needed in order to put my career into hyperdrive," Gilbert said. Gearing up allowed Gilbert to rise from UBS's investment bank to Summit Partners, a growth equity firm in Menlo Park, California. He's now the managing director of capital markets at Thoma Bravo, one of the world's largest technology-focused buyout firms, with some $142 billion in assets under management. Gilbert's team of six works with banks, other PE firms, and direct lenders to secure financing that enables Thoma Bravo's dealmakers to make investments. The credit can come from new investments but also from refinancing and repricing existing investments. Through his relationships with about 150 banks and direct lenders, Gilbert has led the industry with pioneering financing structures — such as utilizing private debt markets — to arrange more than $84 billion in total funded debt since 2018. One loan helped finance Thoma Bravo's $10.7 billion acquisition of the planning software provider Anaplan. Gilbert and the team bypassed traditional banks to secure a $2.9 billion loan from PE lenders, including Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, within eight days. This year alone, Gilbert and the capital markets team have led 25 refinancings and repricings totaling over $23 billion in transaction volumes. Those efforts have saved Thoma Bravo more than $250 million in annual interest savings across the firm's portfolio. Spending her first years at BlackRock as an analyst in its corporate mergers-and-acquisitions advisory arm gave Ding, now an infrastructure investor, a front-row seat to the firm's push into private markets. The Princeton grad joined BlackRock in 2015 after a stint at the investment firm Harding Loevner. In the years she spent on the corporate strategy team, BlackRock acquired First Reserve Corporation's energy-infrastructure investment platform and the private credit firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners. More recently, BlackRock made its biggest push into private markets, agreeing to buy Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The chance to learn where the world's largest asset manager was placing its bets was a "very compelling place to be," she said, and it ultimately convinced her to join the infrastructure business in 2019. As the head of Americas for BlackRock's infrastructure solutions unit, Ding advises on about $15 billion in capital commitments and oversees the origination, underwriting, and management of infrastructure investment opportunities in the US, Canada, and Latin America. She has directly led or co-led over $2 billion of investments, ranging from renewable energy to data-center businesses to waste-management companies. She sees a "tremendous amount of opportunity" in companies related to energy transition, security, and reliability. She also focuses on the infrastructure players set to benefit from the decarbonization of carbon-emitting industries such as transportation and waste. Her path to private markets was influenced by her mentor, the late Jerry Kenney, an advisor to BlackRock and a former Merrill Lynch executive who led the bank's expansion into investment banking. As an analyst, Ding took on side projects for Kenney, who was working on ways to grow BlackRock's alternative-investments business. Ding says she continues to raise her hand to take on extra work her team needs to succeed. "It doesn't matter if you're a director or a VP and you consider it analyst-level work," she said. "If it needs to get done to move the business or a team forward, you just do it." In two years, Alcalay has built a high-performing business in a buzzy macro strategy for the quant behemoth Two Sigma. Few hedge-fund trades have inspired more hype lately than Alcalay's niche, the lucrative basis trade, which harvests small price discrepancies from highly levered government-bond positions. "It's really hard to hire good people for that seat because, for the most part, the good people are doing really well, and their firms are clinging on to them tightly," Colin Teichholtz, a senior portfolio manager who was looking to build out a team at BlueMountain in 2018, said. He was thrilled to happen upon a young, relatively unknown trader at Barclays. Alcalay comes from an unorthodox background. He's a former information warfare officer with the US Navy, where he earned the prestigious Joint Service Commendation Medal for his work in Afghanistan. He subsequently worked with the National Security Administration, briefing senior military leaders on strategic-level threats. After leaving active duty, he joined Goldman Sachs in interest-rates trading, an uncommon career path for military veterans. But Alcalay's war-zone experience sharpened skills — such as making sense of raw data and sources of intel and judging their limitations to draw a conclusion — have proved well-suited to bond trading, a trader close to him said. He has the "capability to layer human intuition on top of technology," the trader said. At BlueMountain, Alcalay identified trades not just in US Treasurys but also in the European and UK markets. Alcalay covered it all and did so with poise, Teichholtz said. When panic struck the repo funding markets in 2019, he kept his cool. "He generated returns in excess of our targets with a really high Sharpe," Teichholtz said. Alcalay joined Brevan Howard two years later. In 2022, Two Sigma sought out Alcalay to build a bond basis trade strategy. His trading book has since grown substantially, and the firm continues to scale up around his strategy, people familiar with the matter said. Alcalay founded a group to support other veterans involved in trading, and he helped organize a recent networking event and panel at Two Sigma for translating a military background to quantitative finance. Portfolio manager Gnedin grew up in a family full of astrophysicists and rocket scientists — which is part of the reason she never wanted to be one. "I guess for me, acting out was choosing the econ path," Gnedin said. The Princeton alum was inspired by her economist grandfather, the "lone black sheep" of the family who "was always the most interesting man at any dinner party," she said. But after two years as an analyst in investment banking, Gnedin, "a little bit jaded on finance," went in search of something new. In 2017, she landed a position at the largest publicly traded hedge fund, Man Group, where Gnedin has forged a path that marries her family's backgrounds. Gnedin originally joined as a quantitative researcher building algorithms for the firm's systematic investment arm, which relies on mathematical models to make investment decisions. One algorithm that Gnedin developed systematically reviewed existing model performance and identified which models should be retired. Since launching in 2019, the algorithm, one of the first of its kind at the firm, has led to about two to three models a year being dropped, she said. In 2020, Gnedin moved to the portfolio management side of the business, where she directly manages about $1.4 billion in equities in developed markets. As a quant PM, Gnedin said her job is more about managing models than specific stocks. She still spends plenty of time researching modeling techniques in old textbooks and tinkering with algorithms. When she's not nose-deep in economic research or alternative datasets, you can likely find the San Franciscan taking in the views on the Stonewall-Panoramic Trail in the East Bay with her husky. When she entered the University of Georgia, Osteen planned to pursue a career in science, but she fell in love with economics after taking an introductory course at the end of her sophomore year. After graduating in 2016, she interned at the Federal Reserve full time while studying applied economics at George Washington University. She earned her master's degree and spent another four years at the Federal Reserve as a research assistant and financial analyst. Osteen became more interested in working on Wall Street as she learned the ins and outs of stress testing and analyzed pending mergers-and-acquisition proposals from large banks. Seeking a faster-paced environment, Osteen left in 2022 to join Fidelity's asset management division as a fixed-income portfolio analyst. "Taking on challenges and trying to figure out puzzles really gets me motivated and passionate, and I feel like that is what asset management and fixed-income markets are all about," she said. "You're constantly trying to figure out and use all your resources and information to piece the puzzle together." She works with a team of three portfolio managers with about $72 billion in assets, including a low-duration bond ETF that has amassed $374 million since its February launch. In addition to her day-to-day account management work, she oversees due diligence and relationship management with bank and insurer partners for the desk's $35 billion book of stable value funds, a popular low-risk product that is guaranteed by insurers. Osteen, who had no experience in asset management before joining Fidelity, credits her swift transition to her willingness to speak up. "Not being afraid of ask questions and give your opinions and thoughts constructively is very important," she said. "It's just really being comfortable and willing to put yourself out there." At JPMorgan Asset Management, Lenihan manages $21 billion in 8,000 customizable portfolios that provide generous tax advantages for the firm's clients. He is an architect of the bank's booming Tax Smart Separately Managed Account platform, which leverages the technology of 55ip, a fintech that Lenihan helped identify for a partnership and JPMorgan then acquired. The dual role of fund manager and product developer combines his interest in finance with his engineering background. An engineer by training, Lenihan began his career monitoring the quality of suppliers' parts at Chrysler. Soon, however, he found himself thinking more about the economics of how truck and car parts played into the company's profitability than the manufacturing aspect. Hung up on these questions, and after talking to friends from the University of Michigan about their finance internships, Lenihan decided he wanted to know more about investing. He was hired into a rotational analyst program for JPMorgan's private bank, and to get closer to an investing role, he took on additional projects with portfolio managers and earned his CFA. Learning about how companies make money, why they should be financed, or their value, was "really intriguing to me," Lenihan, who also has an MBA from Wharton, said. "And as I got there, it was something that I just kind of fell in love with — really dove in since day one." His programming skills and willingness to pitch in on different projects led to opportunities like building out the firm's robo-advisor with his mentor, Ted Dimig. Lenihan led the development of a product that required buy-in from across internal tech teams, third-party partners, and operations. "That was the genesis of a lot of my passion and love for that dual-hat role was being able to flex multiple skill sets," he said. He still dedicates time to finding fintech partners to work with or acquire. Lenihan also launched a mentoring program that seeks to build connectivity among different teams at the asset manager. "I have learned firsthand about how successful you can be with those close partnerships when you work together, " he said. Jump to

We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs. The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

Title: Campus Organizers Are Using Research to Expose and Oppose the Global War Machine

Graduate workers and student groups across the US are mapping university ties to militarism and Israel’s war on Gaza. (Photo: Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University, April 2024) The explosion of campus protest movements against Israel’s siege of Gaza, especially during the April 2024 encampments, has been historic. These movements showed the whole world that swaths of young people across the U.S. stand in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing a genocidal assault. The encampments created crises for college administrators who purport to defend values of justice and human rights while also looking to appease their trustees and donor bases who back Israel’s brutal war. A generation has been galvanized and politicized, experiencing extreme repression for simply demanding their institutions cut ties with one of the great human catastrophes of modern times: Israel’s indiscriminate destruction of Gaza, the killing of tens of thousands of people and injuring of many more, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the annihilation of Gaza’s universities. A lesser known thread stretching across this campus upsurge has been the critical role of power research in supporting movement organizing, labor struggle, political education, and protest strategy. Across universities and colleges, grad workers and undergrad students have done the nitty-gritty work of digging into their endowment’s investments, researching the financial ties between the Pentagon and campus labs, and mapping out the connections between university trustees and the war machine. Not all this research is new. It builds on years of work by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and other campus divestment campaigns. But there’s no doubt that this moment, marked by a heightened awareness of the tight relationship between university power structures and the corporate-military-political bloc upholding occupation and apartheid against Palestinians, has generated new urgency in the longtime craft of mapping corporate power. These new research efforts that are unmasking university ties to militarism and war crimes are being carried out by union graduate workers from California to Michigan to Massachusetts who are organizing to stop the flow of their research — their labor — into military projects and military technology. They’re being done by undergrad organizers from New York to Rhode Island who are campaigning for divestment and building out power maps to illustrate university ties to weapons’ companies. These organizers are forming research committees and working collaboratively. They’re sharing findings and skills through teach-ins and meetings. They’re building national networks and communicating across geography through group chats and webinars. These new research efforts are also drawing direct inspiration from past models of campus power research — anti-South African apartheid campaigns of the 1980s, but especially from the 1968 pamphlet, “Who Rules Columbia?,” which mapped out the Columbia University power structure during that campus’s historic uprising against war and racism over five decades ago. Indeed, some campus researchers today are communicating with and learning directly from the veteran researchers who quite literally wrote “Who Rules Columbia?” Thus, grad workers and campus organizers for Palestine today are not merely doing research — they’re upholding and expanding a proud movement tradition of power research that stretches back to the the civil rights movements and the SNCC Research Department and to the Vietnam antiwar movement and National Action/Research on the Military-Industrial Complex (NARMIC). In charging forward with a new and broad effort to map out university power today, grad workers and campus organizers are also reviving an analysis of the militarized corporate university that was pioneered by activists in the 1960s and 1970s. This analysis understands the university not as a site of harmonious apprenticeship, but as an employer that relies on graduate labor to function everyday and to serve the imperatives of military production; not as an idyllic site of learning, but as a power structure governed by corporate elites, interlocked with influential blocs of capital stretching from finance to real estate to technology, with close ties to the war machine and with endowments that operate like hedge funds, ready to undermine its own purported values and students at the whims of wealthy donors and war industry partners. “The Beginning of the Military Supply Chain” As Israel’s siege of Gaza intensified in the fall of 2023, flattening and starving the enclave while killing tens of thousands of people, students across the U.S., from Stanford to NYU, began protesting to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and that their institutions divest from and break ties with Israel. Grad workers, as laborers within their universities, wondered how to respond. “A lot of the research workers and grad students here were really struggling to metabolize our grief and figure out what sort of interventions on behalf of Palestine we were positioned to make,” said Isabel Kain, a fourth-year union graduate worker in the Astronomy and Astrophysics department at at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). Specifically, Kain was thinking about the connections between her own workplace at UCSC and the war on Gaza. “The research that we do can go on to create the killing machines of tomorrow,” she said. “We are the very beginning of the military supply chain.” Universities are a critical part of the U.S. war machine. Billions of dollars from the Department of Defense flow annually into labs whose research findings advance weapons’ systems. University endowments invest in military-tied corporations and many university trustees are interlocked with war profiteers. “The U.S. military-industrial complex “could not function without American universities,” wrote Harry Zehner in the Nation. “It needs college-educated engineers and scientists. It relies on thousands of research projects, funded by the Pentagon and carried out by academics around the country.” Moreover, it relies on thousands of graduate workers and postdoctoral fellows to carry out the research labor and lab work behind those research projects. Heeding the call of Palestinian trade unions in late 2023 to “end all forms of complicity with Israel’s crimes,” including “halting the arms trade with Israel” and “all funding and military research,” UCSC grad workers started looking toward their own workplace to take action. They weren’t the only ones. At Columbia University, some grad workers were also thinking along the same lines. “We were looking at our science and saying, ‘This is pretty messed up,’” said Kelsey Harrison, a third-year Chemistry PhD student. “Our government is sending weapons that are being used by Israel, and our science is contributing to advancing those weapons.” Building a National Network Toward the end of 2023, these grad workers were increasingly connecting with each other across campuses to discuss what they could do, as university workers, about Israel’s war on Palestine. This connecting was made easier because many of these grad workers were already plugged into a preexisting network of cross-campus union solidarity. The past few years have seen a historic wave of bottom-up grad worker organizing. Thousands of grad workers have unionized and gone on strike. This new campus labor militancy has been driven by militant, democratic unionism, often affiliated with left-led unions like the United Auto Workers (UAW) and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). This organizing infrastructure, connecting grad workers from the University of California to Columbia, Michigan to MIT, laid the basis for easier communication, strategizing, and skill-sharing around Palestinian solidarity and anti-militarism work on campus. “None of this is by coincidence,” said Harrison. Dozens of grad workers were already communicating through Zoom calls and group chats. There was growing interest in digging into university ties to militarism and the war on Gaza. With consciousness heightened by years of organizing, there was a sense that grad workers, given their critical role at universities and science labs, could have a big impact as workers in the Palestine solidarity movement, especially by withholding their labor. “When we saw this call to end complicity and stop arming Israel, we realized that it was graduate workers who were positioned to intervene at the very beginning of the supply chain,” said Kain. “It was graduate workers who were positioned to cut the flow of labor and expertise and work going into the military industrial complex that will flow on to harm Palestinians.” “Palestine is absolutely a workplace issue,” she said. With interest growing, some suggested that grad workers meet more concertedly to dig into their university’s connections to the catastrophe in Gaza and to U.S. militarism. As workers embedded in the military supply chain, they could use the research into these ties to help identify points of leverage to disrupt the war machine. A new network, Researchers Against War (RAW), was born out of this moment. Going into 2024, RAW held zoom meetings that brought together grad workers across the U.S. Mike Locker, a co-author of the original 1968 pamphlet “Who Rules Columbia?,” offered guidance on the ties between universities and militarism and how power research could support their organizing. Out of all this, grad workers were feeling galvanized to look deeper into their employers — their universities and labs — to support Palestine and challenge the larger military-industrial complex. “Researching Like Mad” Emboldened and connected, grad workers were starting to map out their institutions’ ties to the war machine, supporting each other by sharing research tips and organizing advice. At UCSC, around ten grad workers began “researching like mad for a couple of months,” said Kain, mapping the flows of money from the Department of Defense to UCSC and University of California system. They dug into public records of federal grants, mined sites like USASpending.gov, followed grant numbers tied to specific labs, and looked at the school’s Office of Sponsored Projects. Kain said that in 2023 the University of California system received $333 million of Department of Defense basic research funding that flowed into a range of labs across campuses. At UCSC specifically, they found 18 labs with active Department of Defense contracts and 10 labs with recently expired DoD contracts. They identified areas of potential “research misuse,” as Kain put it, meaning “clearly weaponizable stuff.” UCSC grad workers used these findings to organize within their departments. “It was really this funding research that unlocked the possibility of talking to our coworkers,” said Kain. In January 2024, nearly three dozen UCSC astronomers penned a collective letter that stated their commitments to “demilitarizing” their research, with specific demands like “withholding academic labor benefiting militarism” and “refusing research collaboration with federal military institutions as well as private arms and defense companies.” In exchange for millions of Pentagon funding, said the letter, “the products of our research lubricate the churning gears of the war machine.” The letter made direct connections between labor performed at UCSC and the genocide in Palestine and called “on all academic workers everywhere – graduate students, postdocs, lecturers, faculty – to divest their labor from apartheid, genocide, and militarism.” The UCSC astrophysics letter was an inspiring model to a core of Columbia grad workers who had also started to explore their school’s ties to weapons’ companies. They discovered that a “huge amount” of Defense Department funding went into basic research at research institutions. In 2021, Columbia received over $49 million in research and development funding from the Defense Department, the 28th most in the nation. A snapshot from Columbia grad workers’ research into Pentagon lab funding at Columbia. With this research, they started putting together a chart that tied Pentagon funding to specific research projects at Columbia. Like UCSC, Columbia grad workers used their research to support organizing within their departments, holding one-on-one conversations with fellow grad workers. The research was a “great way to bring people in,” said Harrison. “A lot of people cared about Palestine but didn’t know what to do about it. This is a very concrete way that they can start to look into their own position and role and how they’re contributing to the military.” Teach-Ins and Research Committees Meanwhile, RAW was working to expand the national effort among grad workers to challenge, as higher ed laborers, the flow of their labor into military production and campus ties to militarism. On February 12, RAW hosted a national teach-in and organizing discussion over Zoom, titled “Demilitarizing Research from Vietnam to Palestine,” where dozens of attendees heard from grad workers and post-docs who had started to map and organize around their schools’ Pentagon ties. Teach-in attendees also heard from veterans of the 1960s and 1970s like Mike Locker, who recalled how the Vietnam antiwar movement used power research to protest against campus ties to the war machine. Along the way, grad workers at individual campuses continued to push the movement locally. Columbia RAW members spoke at the Columbia encampment on April 19, where they also passed out a RAW brochure. From the Researchers Against War (RAW) brochure A few days later, on April 22, Columbia RAW and Science for the People, a group dedicated to demilitarizing science research, held a joint campus teach-in at Columbia on the movement for antiwar STEM research. Columbia RAW gave a presentation, “Towards Anti-War STEM Research,” that laid out in painstaking detail the ties between the Defense Department and university research labs. A slide from Columbia RAW’s teach-in presentation, “Towards Anti-War STEM Research.” Other campuses were also plugging into the national research network. At the University of Michigan, grad workers with the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) were among the several campus efforts to hold a “watch party” for RAW’s February 12 teach-in. GEO had started a Palestine solidarity working group as part of the union’s Solidarity and Political Action Committee. The working group had different arms, including a research team. Grad researchers started to “map labs around campus,” said Nathan Kim, a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information, and “basically try to determine what different sources of funding they were getting.” With those research findings, they’d use an “organizing approach,” Kim said — for example, talking to students about Project Nimbus when they discovered funding from Google. They hoped to “politicize what it means to do research,” said Kim, and organize grad workers to refuse Pentagon funding. This “lab tracker research” was one wing of their larger research efforts; endowment research and research into the University of Michigan’s affiliations with pro-Israel institutions such as the Michigan-Israel Partnership were others. Part of the zine on the UMichigan endowment that researchers and comms organizers put together. After the TAHRIR Coalition formed at the University of Michigan in November 2023, GEO grad workers continued to do research as different efforts across the campus gravitated together, and GEO and its research team soon became part of the broader campus-wide TAHRIR project. Power Research and the Columbia Encampment As in 1968, students at Columbia University in 2024 made a breakthrough for the wider campus movement when their April 2024 encampment — and the repression against it — galvanized the nation. Power research played a role in informing the encampment’s demands and messaging. In October 2023, Columbia students reactivated Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which formed in 2016 but had since become inactive, and formed different CUAD subcommittees, including a research committee. In late 2023 the coalition submitted a lengthy divestment proposal to Columbia’s Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing (it was rejected). With the April 2024 encampmentent taking off, the research committee put together a tabling pamphlet that contained a power map of university ties to Israeli occupation, apartheid and genocide. It showed how university trustees were tied to war profiteering. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia Trustee Jeh Johnson, for example, is a board director of Lockheed Martin, a major weapons supplier to Israel. It also showed how the Columbia University Investment Company, which oversees CU’s endowment, invests in companies like Google and Microsoft, and in the funds of asset management giant BlackRock, who all bolster Israel’s ongoing oppression of Palestinans. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia A Columbia undergraduate and CUAD member who was involved in making the power map, and who asked that their name be withheld, said the map’s creation was very much a “communal process.” It started with a scribbled rough draft on paper. The draft was based on researchers’ findings. Out of this, someone used a computer program to create the finished map that was used in the pamphlet. The power map and the brochure were created for specific organizing purposes. Organizers wanted to make accessible for students the material connections between Columbia and Palestine. “It’s not necessarily clear to an ordinary college student how they have a direct and personal connection to the genocide,” said the Columbia undergraduate. “The brochure was the best way to lay out our understanding of that connection in a direct way,” conveying “how we felt and what we learned from our research inside CUAD,” they said. The pamphlet made transparent and concrete what the encampment was demanding. “It showed that students were fighting for divestment from these primary companies, and why,” said the Columbia undergraduate. The research into the Columbia University power structure also informed protest strategy. This included choosing specific trustees to protest. “Our research allows us to pick the best possible target and have the most direct justification for our action,” they said. Organizing and Research Across Other Campuses Research and power mapping played important roles within a range of other university protests as well. University of California organizers mapped out the UC Board of Regents and named certain investments tied to Israel. Organizers at the University of Massachusetts laid out their ties to weapons producer Raytheon. At Emory University, organizers focused on the role of Motorola’s surveillance technology from Atlanta to Palestine. Researchers at the University of Michigan compiled a thorough report on their endowment, handed out divestment flyers, and used power research to agitate on social media around the Board of Regents and endowment. Brown University did not have an umbrella coalition like CUAD at Columbia or TAHRIR at Michigan, but different groups came together to engage in direct actions, a hunger strike, and an encampment. Palestine solidarity work at Brown has drawn on inspiring precedents of campus divestment campaigns against South African apartheid in the 1980s. The current upsurge has also built on organizing and research from the past few years. In 2020, a student divestment vote created the Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies (ACCRIP), which issued a report, compiled by a group of faculty, grad students, and undergrads, arguing that Brown’s own ESG standards Brown should divest from companies that “facilitate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” Because of all this, said Brown senior Kian Braulik, there was already “a broad base of support for divestment” that “was really democratic” when students started organizing to oppose Israel’s siege of Gaza. Braulik said a group of researchers from different campus groups collaboratively revised that report, extending it from the original 16 pages to over 50 pages, adding new graphic designing to make it look catchier. During the encampment, they handed out copies of the report to show people why they were protesting and what their demands were around divestment. Cover of the longer updated 2024 edition of recommending Brown divest from Israeli occupation Campus organizers also made flyers of ten companies they want Brown to divest from, including Safariland, Boeing, General Dynamics, RTX (formerly Raytheon) and others, with explanations why. All this research and mapping informed the demands at Brown, said Braulik, including their decision to protest Maria Zuber, a Brown trustee who also sits on the board of Textron, a military contractor headquartered in Providence that provides Israel with weapons. Textron, headquartered in Providence, was one company that the Brown University movement highlighted. Organizers at Yale University also made use of power research. Taran Samarth, a second-year PhD student in political science, notes that power research has “deep roots” in New Haven and Yale. Grad workers affiliated with Local 33 Unite Here have used power research to support their organizing, while Fossil Free Yale imparted critical help for campus Palestine organizers. Samarth said the organizers who had done fossil finance research were “really helpful” in supporting Yale’s Palestinian solidarity movement and that “those same skills” were deployed to “thinking about Palestine and about the genocide.” Samarth said there hadn’t previously been much focus among Palestinian solidarity activists on Yale’s investments. “If people said divestment, it was sort of a gesture,” they said. “We didn’t really know what the connections were because no one had really done the work to investigate them.” Yale organizers stepped up that research in October 2023, as campus actions started taking off. In November, an anonymous zine was distributed that named specific connections between Yale and Israel’s war on Palestine through Yale’s investments, while the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition campaigned around Yale’s investments in weapons’ companies through ETF funds. Page from anonymous zine on Yale’s endowment’s ties, “Yale is Complicit.” “Power research was a really key part of demand-making and orienting the campus movement early on,” said Samarth. The following months saw direct action protests, teach-ins, and the encampment, all which focused on divestment demands that research helped to clarify. Samarth also says that that power research helped students develop a deeper understanding of the corporate university. “There’s this whole broader problem of the university and its relationships with New Haven and the world,” they said.” From the “Yale Corp, Divest from War” pamphlet, distributed at the Beinecke Plaza occupation and encampment at Yale in the Spring of 2024. And while these campus movements played out locally, they were also stitched together through national networks and coalitions. For example, Kim at University of Michigan, Braulik and Brown, and Samarth at Yale were among the researchers who connected to form the Endowment Justice Research Network (EJRN). “We were just trying to get people working on similar things together to talk to each other and develop methods together,” said Kim. Kim went to conferences like Labor Notes and the People’s Conference for Palestine in Detroit and passed out half sheets with QR codes to grow the network or recruited by word of mouth. This past summer, EJRN co-hosted a webinar with LittleSis on endowment research. “One goal of the EJRN is to identify some shared connections across universities,” said Kim. “Finding points where we can mobilize a shared campaign would be awesome, and that’s one goal for the future that we have.” 1968’s “Who Rules Columbia?” Inspires a New Generation When grad workers and campus organizers started researching and power mapping their universities’ ties to militarism, they didn’t do this in a historical vacuum. This new organizing wave drew inspiration from campus divestment movements against South African apartheid from the 1980s, and, especially, from power research efforts five decades earlier in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, Columbia students waged a historic protest on campus against the university’s connections to racism and the war in Vietnam. Out of this, a small group of researchers produced a powerful pamphlet, “Who Rules Columbia?,” that mapped out and analyzed the university’s power structure and its deep ties to the war machine and corporate interests. “Who Rules Columbia?” showed that universities were deeply interlocked with society’s larger corporate power structure and ruling elite. The same forces and interests dominating national politics and economic decision-making — real estate, Wall Street, the military industrial complex — also occupied the governing heights of university power. For grad workers at Columbia organizing around Palestine, “Who Rules Colombia?” was an inspiration. “Reading it showed me what is possible,” said Harrison. Nor were they just abstractly inspired by “Who Rules Columbia?” They were mentored by and worked closely with Mike Locker, a seasoned power researcher who was one of the original authors of the original pamphlet in 1968. Locker joined Researchers Against War meetings and Columbia grads soon connected with him directly. They started having regular breakfasts with him where they would absorb lessons from Locker’s years of experience doing power research. We would “just sit down and talk and ask each other questions and check in,” said one Columbia grad worker in chemistry, who asked that their name be withheld. “He’s able to apply his strategies from the 1960s to current times. It’s just been incredible, not only for information and resources, but also for inspiration.” “Who Rules Columbia?” tweeted out by one grad worker during the April 2024 encampment wave Kim said the research group at University of Michigan read Who Rules Columbia? and that the pamphlet “changed our campaign” by focusing attention on the university as a larger power structure, such as “the people controlling the endowment” and “the backgrounds of the regents.” “‘Who Rules Colombia?’ made us realize that what’s most important and useful to us is not just understanding what the endowment is invested in,” said Kim, “but the networks of power around the university that control things at large.” Because of this, University of Michigan organizers started new research projects, including a dossier on the Board of Regents. Kim also took inspiration from Locker — a University of Michigan alum — when the power research veteran joined the debut Researchers Against War teach-in that included grad workers from across universities. “He talked about his own experiences, both at Columbia and the University of Michigan,” said Kim. “That was super helpful for us.” It wasn’t just the mentoring and support from Locker that inspired the Columbia grad workers who met with him. It was also his personal example as someone who has dedicated his life to the movement. “To see people who had been committed in 1968, in their youth, and who are still committed,” was deeply inspiring for the Columbia grad worker who asked that their name be withheld. “It really grounds you in the fact that this is a lifelong commitment and that it’s possible to lead a life that is guided by your values.” * * * The current campus movements for Palestine illustrate the usefulness of power research for supporting organizing efforts. The deeper ties between universities and militarism are not necessarily apparent, but research and mapping can help uncover and illustrate these connections. Doing so helps educate movements, offering a clearer sense of what they’re up against, and making more transparent how universities are both power structures within themselves as well as crucial components of the wider corporate and militarist power structure. Understanding these interlocks and connections opens up new strategic and tactical possibilities for organizers. Moreover, the very process of doing the research can be an organizing tool: a collective endeavor that builds cohesion, consciousness and solidarity. Critically, it’s important to remember that power research is not an end in itself, but rather a tool that serves organizing efforts and, often, can strengthen them — whether that be for grad workers making clearer sense of their relationship to the military supply chain and how to disrupt it, or campus groups seeking to better understand and communicate their institution’s ties to the war machine and identify focuses for protest actions. University power — elite-managed, corporate-tied, military-aligned, ultimately repressive — has been unmasked for a new generation of students. RAW is still meeting regularly and drawing from grad workers in the sciences, engineering and humanities. Campus groups are retooling their efforts to challenge university ties to militarism. As a new semester takes off; as Israel’s monstrous war against Palestinians continues, fully backed by the U.S. and its military industry; and as the corporate university shows no signs of abating, we may be seeing just the beginning of a new wave of power research and mapping of campus power structures — and beyond.

Title: Why The Ether ETF Has Underperformed Versus Bitcoin
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/29/why-the-ether-etf-has-underperformed-versus-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:19:23Z
Full Content:
Ether continues to grow but price levels remain subdued When the SEC announced it had approved multiple spot ether ETF products in July 2024 market sentiment was almost universally supportive and encouraged by this action. Following years of stymying efforts by industry advocates and operators to create and trade spot ETFs, the two largest cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – had received ETF approval within the same year. In stark contrast to the dramatic increase in price that bitcoin experienced, the majority of which has remined intact even as headline volatility has continued to increase, the price response to the ether ETF was muted. Even more interestingly the trading volumes and institutional appetite for these ETF products has also remained more lower than the spot bitcoin ETF and/or market forecasts. Highlighting this sluggish beginning are the outflows that have been occurring from the ether ETF products, capped by a nearly $80 million outflow on a single Monday, which was the highest since a $98 million outflow figure in July 2024. While bitcoin has increased over 50% in 2024 (since the launch of spot ETF products), ether has only climbed approximately 15% and has yet to surpass the previous all-time-highs last achieved in 2021. From whichever metric is analyzed the launch of spot ether ETFs has fallen flat when compared to spot bitcoin ETFs. Let’s take a look at a few of the reasons why, despite serving as the blockchain of choice for many Layer 2 applications, the ether ETF has gotten off to a slow start. Even though the cryptoasset space has expanded dramatically in just the last several years, the reality remains that in most media and institutional conversations, bitcoin is still the unquestioned leader. This can be observed either through anecdotally observing business media coverage and corporate announcements, and by watching the actions of TradFi institutions and nation-states alike. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in investment while sending the price of bitcoin up substantially, while corporate purchasers such as Microstrategy continue to focus on exclusively purchasing bitcoin. Larry Fink and Blackrock have issued public facing documents touting the appeal and upside of bitcoin, and nations such as El Salvador and more recently Bhutan have amassed stockpiles of bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape, as well as the dollars that are being allocated by larger institutional investors. As multi-faceted as the crypto landscape continues to be, the narrative and messaging around bitcoin has remained uniquely consistent since inception. From being labeled as digital gold, or a store or value, or the money of the future the narratives around bitcoin have remained steadfast. Even if the specifics of these narratives, or how well they manifest in the market, investors and regulators alike have become familiar with them to base decision making around these frameworks. This consistency has manifested itself even bitcoin is famously decentralized, has no identified creator, nor does the cryptocurrency have any sort of governing body. Ether on the other hand, has seemingly struggled to find a message and/or narrative that is consistent enough, simple enough, or intuitive enough to be seized by mainstream investors. Even though the Ethereum blockchain and the ether token serves as the base layer for many of the enterprise applications that are driving the investment dollars into crypto, the presentation of Ethereum as the internet of the future or other amorphous value propositions have proven difficult for institutional investors to get behind. Last but certainly not least is the reality that, and directly connected to the primary value proposition of Ethereum and ether at large is the fact that ether is perhaps the token most susceptible to the crypto price paradox. Ether serves as the currency of choice for most of the Layer 2 applications that are driving enterprise adoption; stablecoins, DeFi, DAOs, and even NFTs all (for the most part) run and rely on ether. Even with improvements made via various upgrades – which have substantially increased capacity and reduced cost – the fact remains that pricing services in ether will have exercise downward pressure on a price-per-token basis. Put simply any token, be it ether or otherwise, that simultaneously serves as a potential medium of exchange and investment asset (via spot ETFs), is going to need to obtain a medium satisfactory to both interested parties. Given the muted price action of ether following the approval and launch of spot ether ETFs, and the preference of institutions and governments to select bitcoin above other cryptoassets, and it appears that this paradox will continue to exercise influence for the foreseeable future. Crypto ETFs have been a positive development for the sector, but not all such instruments deliver equally positive returns. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Clontarf and Young Munster are the only unbeaten sides in Division 1A after just two rounds of the Energia All-Ireland League which indicates this may well be a particularly competitive campaign in the top flight. Young Munster beat Terenure for the fourth year running at Tom Clifford Park with a thrilling 34-30 victory in which the lead exchanged five times. When Harrison Brewer finished off the try of the match early in the second half and Aran Egan converted they led 22-14, but Munsters responded with a fine try by winger Hubert Gilvarry, which dead-eyed Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski converted from the touchline. After Leszczynski and Egan exchanged penalties, the former then converted a try by Manuel Covella before Egan failed to convert his own try. Leszczynski kicked a penalty before Munsters withheld another siege on their line. Clontarf lead on 10 points courtesy of a second bonus-point win by 29-21 at home to Garryowen courtesy of tries by Dylan Donnellan, inevitably, Tadhg Bird, Louis O’Reilly and Seni Reilly Ashiru. It was the first time that Keith Wood’s three sons – Gordon, Tom and Alex – played together for Garryowen, but although Gordon was on the scoresheet again the Limerick club were unfortunate to emerge with no tangible reward. Defending champions Cork Constitution returned to winning ways with a thumping 51-21 win over Ballynahinch, their Munster fullback Scott Buckley scoring two of their tries. Newly promoted St Mary’s moved up to third in the table with a 32-22 bonus-point away to City of Armagh, while Lansdowne beat UCD 25-10. Similarly in 1B, Nenagh Ormond, with winger Conor McMahon contributing 23 points, and Old Belvedere recorded statement bonus-point wins away to Blackrock and Trinity to emerge as the only two sides in the second tier with two wins from two. There were four high-scoring home wins in 2A, Barnhall leading the way with 11 tries against Buccaneers, while Navan’s first home game in their centenary season was a 22-22 draw with Old Crescent.

Title: BlackRock Dismisses Bitcoin’s Risk Label, Calls It A Smart Investor Play
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-dismisses-bitcoins-risk-label-calls-it-a-smart-investor-play/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T13:00:49Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is currently generating significant interest within the investment community with its most recent report, “Bitcoin: A Unique Diversifier.” This document emphasizes the potential of Bitcoin as a unique asset class that can improve portfolio diversification. BlackRock manages assets valued over $10 trillion, therefore their advice is quite important. The company contends that the distinctive features of Bitcoin, such as its distributed nature and fixed number, set it apart from other conventional financial assets. BlackRock’s effectively launched Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) currently boasts holdings of around $21 billion. Originally introduced earlier this year, the ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has drawn a lot of investor interest. Actually, the fund has garnered more than $14 billion in assets, which demonstrate growing conviction in Bitcoin as a lucrative choice of investment. BlackRock’s research shows that Bitcoin behaves quite differently than traditional risk assets. The company notes that Bitcoin has shown significant volatility, but it insists that its long-term performance is mostly unaffected by other financial markets. For example, bitcoin is up 22% since August 5 when the Yen carry trade was unwound, while gold and the S&P 500 have only risen modestly around 11%. This could suggest that bitcoin has the capability of working in isolation of regular market changes, which therefore makes it a rather compelling choice for investors who would wish to achieve certainties in their investing. The report also underscores the fact that a significant number of Bitcoin holders are experiencing profits. According to data, the majority of investors who have maintained their Bitcoin investments for three years or longer are currently profitable. This trend indicates that there is a growing consensus among investors that Bitcoin can function as a secure refuge during periods of economic instability. More individuals are turning to Bitcoin as a potential store of value as geopolitical tensions increase and trust in traditional financial institutions diminishes. What’s remarkable is how reflective of an institutional investor shift toward cryptocurrencies in general BlackRock’s posture has been. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once was skeptical of digital assets, but has since realized that his skepticism toward Bitcoin was actually “misguided.” This is characteristic of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial organizations. As the institutions are increasing their adoption of Bitcoin, its credibility and acceptance rate will increase with the entry of institutions like BlackRock, which will push it into the mainstream. Another interesting question is whether Bitcoin is a risk-on or risk-off asset. Its near-term trading patterns appear to lean toward risk-on behavior, but long-term data paints another story.

Title: Brace for impact: Something big is coming

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/29/2024 4:02:28 AM PDT by george76 For the last couple of months, I’ve been noting various articles in which very rich people are taking some remarkable steps: Buffett’s vice chairman dumps over half of his Berkshire shares.. Warren Buffett offloads Bank of America shares worth $982 million in latest sale.. Buffett’s Berkshire offloads Bank of America shares again; total sales near $7 billion.. Berkshire quietly dumps half its Apple shares amid unprecedented selling spree.. Blackrock reveals it’s quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools. They watch the economic climate. It’s (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they’re watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Berkshire quietly dumps half its Apple shares amid unprecedented selling spree.. Blackrock reveals it’s quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools. They watch the economic climate. It’s (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they’re watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion..

The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office.

Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don’t know? Wealthy people (usually) aren’t fools.

The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time.

Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it’s the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she’s outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and “would cause mass selling of almost everything – stocks, bonds, homes, art – I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.” But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, “Our country right now is in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‘normal,’ and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.” ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months’ worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don’t know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore – the point is, something is coming. Whatever this “something” will be, it’s almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don’t ignore the ramifications. This “something” may also impact your financial security (if it hasn’t already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We’re very close to that, and we’re very close to a world war.” One person noted, “I believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office.

Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead. UN Agenda 21 , 2030 , Great Reset, ( Let me know if you wish to be added or removed from the list.) Some deliberate crash of the economy under Trump is actually one of the worries I have. But such actors would be easy to target if they acted too openly. When he becomes president, I hope there would be some preventative immediate actions to some move of this kind. However, I don’t know what that would be. National debt = $ 220 Trillion. = US federal debt plus the states and local debt . https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4258075/posts And no mention of Nanzi’s very recent insider trading tip for half a million? Watch Congress and their insider trading. Also, Vance already raised the possibility that they do the Liz Truss coup, where the Bank of England and the Treasury and their @sshole cronies in the City created a financial crisis, then refused to act until she resigned. Definitely greatly concerns me as I’m totally-dependent upon SSI and I’ve been in a precarious situation especially ever since COVID-19(84). Not just “something” but many things. I think about a year ago, treasuries were in complete inversion, w/4 week bills fetching the highest rates. As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it’s back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget.. Unsustainable. The country is going bankrupt.. https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4264439/posts Let’s suppose they confiscate everything to pay it off.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Largest Single-Day Inflow Since Early June

Time Published: 2024-09-29T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The market performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the United States has been impressive over the last few weeks. Continuing their excellent streak, the crypto investment products closed the previous trading week with their best single-day performance in almost four months. The positive investor sentiment surrounding the spot ETFs seems to have also bubbled into the Bitcoin and the general crypto market, which has recovered well from an early price slump in September. On Friday, September 27, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered a total net inflow of $494.27 million, the highest value since the $886 million capital influx on June 4. This was another strong daily performance by the crypto-based products, which posted over $365 million in net inflows barely 24 hours before. According to data from SoSoValue, Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB led the day with an inflow of $203 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC followed in second place with a $124 million influx. In a seeming resurgence, BlackRock’s IBIT came in third with a net inflow of over $110 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a rare positive day, with $26.15 million flowing into the product. Unsurprisingly, this value represents the fund’s highest capital influx since mid-May, reflecting the level of redemption it has experienced since the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched. As a result of Friday’s performance, the total weekly net inflows for the BTC exchange-traded funds rose to a remarkable $1.11 billion. This billion-dollar showing makes it the third consecutive week in which the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs has recorded a cumulative weekly net inflow. The outstanding performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to have inspired its Ethereum counterpart, as the ETH funds posted their second positive trading week since launch. The Ethereum ETFs registered a cumulative net inflow of more than $84.51 million in the past week. On Friday, the total net inflow of spot Ethereum ETFs stood around $58.6 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that Fidelity’s FETH led with a capital influx of $42.5 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA in second with $11.46 million. iShares Ethereum ETF eclipses $1bil in assets… Now in top 20% of all 3,700+ ETFs. Did this is 2 months. pic.twitter.com/iRWaxkjZxl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 28, 2024 In a post on X, ETF expert Nate Geraci mentioned that the BlackRock Ethereum ETF has surpassed the $1 billion mark in terms of assets. While acknowledging that this feat was achieved in two months, Geraci revealed that ETHA is now in the top 20% of over 3,700 ETFs in the United States.

Title: ‘Fellas who were taking the piss are now looking for tips’: at home in the garden with Ireland and Munster rugby star Peter O’Mahony
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/gardening/2024/09/26/fellas-who-were-taking-the-piss-are-now-looking-for-tips-the-knock-on-effect-of-peter-omahonys-love-of-gardening/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Peter O’Mahony isn’t sinking his studs into the world’s greatest rugby pitches, he’s tending to the pristine grass on his own lawn. His love of gardening was brought to international attention during the World Cup when his mother, Caroline, held up a sign declaring she was watering his lawn while he was gone. So the question on everyone’s lips is: was it true? Did she water his lawn? “She did not,” he laughs. “She absolutely did nothing in my garden. I don’t know how she ended up with that sign, to be honest with you. I must get her doing some watering now after that.” The Munster and Ireland flanker’s interest in gardening is not a recent fad. As a child, he loved to help the gardener when he visited his grandmother Maura Conroy in Cork’s Richmond Hill. “They were my earliest memories of spending time in the garden,” he recalls. “Simple stuff, but I remember it being very enjoyable.” His grandmother died last year, but he has something to remember her by in his garden – a Japanese maple tree. “I moved it from her garden a few years ago. It has taken a while to settle in, but this is the first year it has really bloomed nicely.” The garden was one of the features that drew him and his wife Jessica to their home in Blackrock, Co Cork, 10 years ago. “We used to walk by the house a lot and say if it ever came up for sale we’d love to buy it, and all of a sudden it did.” Since then, they have been gradually redeveloping the house and garden. “It was a beautiful old cottage garden, a bit wilder than now, but lots of lovely stuff,” he recalls. When they moved in, he started with the lawn, naturally. “Some people find cutting grass a chore. I don’t. I enjoy it,” he says. As a child he mowed lawns for neighbours, including former Ireland and Munster rugby player Frankie Sheahan. “He used to give me a few bits of gear instead of money. I was delighted with the gear and chatting with Frankie at the time was great fun.” Taking on a mature garden of this size – about 200sq m (2,150sq ft) – was a daunting task, and on reflection he feels he rushed into the work. He would advise anyone in a similar situation to wait a season or two and watch how the garden grows. “But I’m quite impatient to be honest, so that was never going to happen.” Many people are now asking him for advice since he began posting about the garden on Instagram (@peteomahony), where he has amassed more than 300,000 followers. A video of him trimming the sides of the lawn on TikTok (@peteromahony6) has been viewed 5.3 million times. His Annabelle hydrangeas with their giant mophead flowers have garnered much envy. “They have taken over, to be honest with you,” he says. “I didn’t realise how big they were going to get, but it looks well in summer, that kind of block planting.” Weeded, edged, trimmed & seeded some patches. #lawncare But not everything succeeded. “I love wisteria, but I struggle with it. I tried it a couple of times in pots, but I think that’s a bad idea because it’s a hungry, vigorous plant that needs to be in the ground, so that failed a couple times,” he says. “I’ve let a couple things die, watering wise, unfortunately, being away.” Some of his plans for the garden have been held back by his heavy training schedule and travel demands. “I’d love to grow more food, but I don’t have the time at the moment,” he says. “You need to be on top of stuff all the time, but I need to be able to drop things and go for a week or two at a time. And during the summer things get crazy when you are growing food. I’ll definitely get stuck into it more when I finish playing.” But he still finds time to grow potatoes, beetroot and salad leaves. “We have some raspberries and other berries that come back every year. They need to be cut in spring and [we] try to get them picked before the birds get them. And we have a line of apple and pear trees, male and female, that pollinate themselves. Trees are foolproof once you give them the bit of pruning that they need.” He says the garden is starting to mature nicely now. “I was lucky to be able to put some mature shrubbery and plants in there that gave it some structure quite quickly.” It made a perfect backdrop when he and Jessica decided to get married in the garden during the Covid pandemic. “It was lovely. We had our immediate family in the garden and getting it ready gave me something to focus on.” While he’s happy to share his knowledge with other gardeners, he is also keen to learn from the experts. “I’ve always watched Gardeners’ World and I enjoy that. I like Adam Frost and Monty Don obviously is very enjoyable to watch,” he says. “I used to spend a lot of time in west Cork with my uncle who worked as a greenkeeper and grew a lot of his own stuff. He definitely taught me a lot.” And judging by the videos he posts on Instagram, his three children are now learning from him. Their youngest child, Ralph, seems to have inherited his father’s love of lawncare and is often seen pushing a toy lawn mower. “We have lots of songbirds and the kids have their books on recognising the different types of birds. Theo is definitely into the wildlife side of things. He’s very interested in bugs and bees and birds and fishing,” he says. “Indie then is very much into the neat and tidy stuff, keeping things where they should be. And Ralph just runs around trying to break everything up. If they want to get stuck into it, they’re more than capable of digging holes and damaging things.” Speaking of digging holes, his Ireland team-mate Bundee Aki had been threatening to damage his prized lawn for a long time. So when O’Mahony hosted a party after the Six Nations victory and Bundee grabbed a spade, he had good reason to worry. “Bundee put a few divot holes in it,” he says. “I do two or three days on the lawn every spring and autumn to level it and reseed it, so I knew that was coming up and I wasn’t too bothered. But I told him if he went near the flowers or the shrubs there would have been serious trouble.” When he first started posting about his garden on social media, a few team-mates seized the opportunity for some slagging. “But now a lot of the fellas who were taking the piss a bit are all of a sudden looking for tips on what to put where or should I put this in that pot, that sort of thing. There’s a lot of advice being requested.” With all eyes on his retirement plans now that he’s in his last season with Munster, will gardening play a role in that post-rugby future? “I certainly have plans,” he says. “I don’t know about a career, but I certainly have an interest in working on that side of things.” “I’ve always been lucky that I’ve done something that I have a huge passion for, and I have been paid well to do it so I don’t want to get stuck into something that I’m not very passionate about. I’m lucky that I am passionate about this. I’ll definitely do something in that space, but you’ll have to wait and see.” Watch out, Monty Don. There’s a new gardener in town. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin – THIS key signal suggests BTC’s next ATH will be in November

Bitcoin may be ready to climb to new levels over the next few months. Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, driving momentum towards a much-anticipated bull market. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66k, sparking excitement for potential new all-time highs (ATHs) in the final quarter of the year. Here, it’s worth looking at historical data though. Particularly the 2-week Ichimoku Cloud indicator since it has accurately predicted Bitcoin’s ATHs in past cycles. With the current cycle progressing ahead of schedule, there’s probably no need to wait for the moving averages to cross. The leading spans show us when it will happen, indicating that a new high may be formed in November. Source: CryptoCon/X Many are now wondering if November will be the month Bitcoin hits new heights. Especially with institutions and traders keeping a close eye on this timeline. One key factor supporting this possibility is the repetition of the 2019 pattern. The Gaussian Channel on the 3-day BTC chart has turned red, which has historically occurred only twice – During the Covid crash and during Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s previous bull run. When this pattern last emerged during Covid 19, it led to a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin to new ATHs. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could be poised for another major upwards move, and potentially new highs in November. Source: X However, market dynamics will ultimately determine the outcome, and it remains to be seen if this pattern will indeed lead to higher prices. Another factor that could propel Bitcoin higher is the impact of heavily borrowed USDT. Traders have been borrowing large amounts of USDT to buy Bitcoin. However, instead of pushing the price up, it initially led to a decline, causing over-leveraged traders to face losses. This type of market behavior often precedes a significant rally. Especially as retail traders are shaken out through liquidations. If the current trend continues, this will create a perfect setup for Bitcoin to surge to new highs, potentially in November. Source: Hyblock Capital Moreover, BlackRock’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin lends further confidence to the bullish outlook. Earlier this week, BlackRock (IBIT) purchased 4,460 BTC, worth $289 million, increasing its total holdings to over 362,000 BTC. This was followed by another purchase of 1,434 BTC worth $94.3 million. Recently, they added another 5,894 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 363,626 BTC, valued at $23.68 billion. BlackRock’s significant and ongoing investment in Bitcoin means that they foresee substantial price appreciation, possibly as soon as November. Source: Lookonchain/X With historical patterns, market dynamics, and institutional support all aligning, Bitcoin’s price could hit new highs in the near future. The potential for a bullish run remains strong, and traders and investors will be closely monitoring developments as November approaches. If these factors come together, Bitcoin may not only hit new ATHs but also establish itself firmly in higher price ranges for the rest of the year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto On Verge Of Losing Iconic Top Bitcoin Holder Crown To U.S. BTC ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-nakamoto-on-verge-of-losing-iconic-top-bitcoin-holder-crown-to-u-s-btc-etfs/

After less than a year of trading on Wall Street, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are well on pace to surpass the estimated BTC stack of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Should this accumulation trend continue, the Bitcoin ETFs may collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi by as early as this Christmas. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds now trading on American stock exchanges have amassed an astounding $17.8 billion in inflows in 2024 — representing a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC. That is just about 84,000 BTC away from the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. The ETFs are closing in on Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC stash, which the world’s most elusive man mined in the infancy of Bitcoin and hasn’t touched after disappearing more than 13 years ago. And the spot Bitcoin ETFs now aren’t far behind. The January launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Billions of dollars have hit the funds as investors previously scared off from crypto investing finally got a safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin. The top three ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have accumulated 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. In total, all the BTC ETFs need to load up on roughly 183,953 BTC to surpass Satoshi’s believed tally. If these funds continue increasing their Bitcoin reserves at the same rate, they could overtake Satoshi’s stockpile and kick him off the top. US bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock.. pic.twitter.com/kTxlIzjJy6 Tolou Capital Management founder Spencer Hakimian shared Balchunas’s sentiment, predicting that “ETFs are going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas”, to which the Bloomberg pundit agreed, adding that BlackRock’s ETF alone will at some point top the list of Bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, a top crypto market analyst has recently posited that the fast-rising concentration of Bitcoin by spot ETFs is the main reason the United States is “regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings,” compared to the rest of the world.

Title: Ireland keep familiar look for opening WXV1 clash with New Zealand
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/09/28/ireland-keep-familiar-look-for-opening-wxv1-clash-with-new-zealand/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T16:10:13Z
Full Content:
Ireland women’s head coach Scott Bemand has made two changes from the side that comfortably beat Australia 36-10 in Belfast recently for their opening WXV1 clash with New Zealand at BC Place in Vancouver on Sunday (7pm local time, 3am Monday Irish time) Stacey Flood comes in to start at fullback, with Eimear Considine switching to the right wing and Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe retaining her place on the left wing. The other change comes in the pack with Fiona Tuite coming in for Ruth Campbell to join Dorothy Wall in the secondrow. Uncapped prop Andrea Stock has been named among the replacements. Edel McMahon will captain the side from the backrow as Bemand retains continuity from the six-try victory over Australia. “We’ve had a really good training week here in Vancouver, including a valuable hit out against France on Wednesday,” said Bemand on the eve of their opening game. “We’re facing into three matches against the top teams in the world, and New Zealand first up on Sunday present physical and ball movements threats, so the training we’ve done and the intensity of the session against France has let us tune into that. “In terms of selection, we’ve had some good competition for places in recent weeks which has led to some difficult conversations. We’re pleased with how the group are performing, and we feel we’ve got the right blend in our matchday Squad for the opening game of the campaign.” IRELAND (v New Zealand): Stacey Flood (Railway Union); Eimear Considine (UL Bohemian/Munster), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College /Munster), Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster), Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) (capt), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Carlyle joins list of possible Thames Water rescue backers
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/carlyle-joins-list-of-possible-thames-water-rescue-backers-13223719
Time Published: 2024-09-28T13:53:00Z
Full Content:
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will appoint an independent monitor to Thames Water as soon as next week as the utility inches closer to collapse, Sky News understands. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 28 September 2024 16:09, UK Carlyle, the American investment giant, has become the latest global fund to weigh an investment in Thames Water as the stricken utility races to avoid being nationalised. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which has roughly $435bn in assets under management, is at the very preliminary stages of assessing whether an investment in Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) would be viable. Britain's biggest water and wastewater company, which has about 16 million customers, is edging towards the brink of collapse after warning in recent days that its financial liquidity is set to expire months earlier than previously anticipated. It has also seen its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by two leading rating agencies. Carlyle is one of a long list of prospective investors approached by Rothschild, the investment bank advising Thames Water's board, as the utility scrambles to raise more than £3bn in the coming months. This weekend, people close to the process confirmed that Carlyle had been approached but said it was "too early" to judge whether the firm might participate in a rescue deal through one or more of its funds. Among the others sounded out by Rothschild are Brookfield, the Canadian investment giant, and Global Infrastructure Partners, which is now owned by BlackRock. BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes Uncomfortable truth is that Thames Water's fate may be out of existing management's hands Thames Water lines up court dates to push through huge debt restructuring Many investors and industry analysts believe, however, that the Rothschild-led process is destined to fail given the massive financial restructuring which faces Thames Water. The company has about £16bn in debt, with approximately £10bn of that accounted for by a group of 90 funds which have appointed Jefferies and Akin Gump to represent them. That syndicate is now preparing its own rescue plan in the coming weeks, which is likely to include an enormous debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out the existing shareholders. Thames Water's future remains so shrouded in uncertainty because the industry watchdog, Ofwat, has rejected the company's initial spending plans for the next five-year regulatory period. The company is now engaged in discussions with Ofwat ahead of its final determination in December. A bridging loan of about £1bn is being contemplated by some of Thames Water's creditors, but some stakeholders remain sceptical that any new financing will be forthcoming without greater regulatory certainty. "Until the lenders know what they are bridging to, the concern deepens that they risk throwing good money after bad," said one fund. TWUL's board is said to have met in the last 48 hours to discuss the implications of its latest rating downgrades and impending liquidity shortfall. One creditor said that Ofwat was expected to appoint an independent monitor next week to scrutinise the company's progress against its turnaround plan. Ofwat, which signalled in August that it would make such an appointment, declined to comment. If new investment into Thames Water is not forthcoming before it runs out of cash, the government will have little choice but to sanction the temporary nationalisation of the company. This would be done through a Special Administration Regime (SAR), a procedure tested only once before when Bulb Energy collapsed in 2021. As part of its contingency planning for implementing a far-reaching restructuring, Thames Water has booked court dates in November to progress a rescue deal. A source close to the company said that Thames Water "continues to look at all options for extending its liquidity and raising new equity". "Reserving court dates is sensible forward planning and a part of keeping all options open."

Title: Jonathan Skrmetti’s Top 5 Successes as Tennessee’s Attorney General

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) Audrey Streb Audrey Streb is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. As Tennessee’s attorney general for only two years, Republican Jonathan Skrmetti is racking up wins for conservatives in policy and law against the Biden-Harris administration and private sector actors. One of those successes looms at the U.S. Supreme Court, where in the term that begins Oct. 1 the justices are expected to take up the federal government’s attempt to kill a Tennessee law restricting gender transitions for children. In the case, called United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, the high court will hear arguments and then decide whether the Tennessee law violates the Constitution in attempting to protect minors subjected to dangerous, life-altering medical procedures. “Twenty-five different states have enacted similar, and in some cases, identical laws,” Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. The Tennessee ban is “very logical, very reasonable, and very constitutional,” Perry said, noting that Skrmetti is “working overtime to defend children.” The state law bans puberty blockers, hormones, and gender-transition surgeries for minors. In court filings, Skrmetti and other Tennessee officials argued that gender-reassignment surgery on minors has “exploded” in recent years and that these procedures are “unproven and risky.” Skrmetti, now 47, was sworn in as attorney general on Sept. 1, 2022. Married and the father of four, the Franklin resident previously was chief deputy attorney general under his predecessor, Herbert H. Slatery III, for three years. Mr. President, no matter the intention, changes to the law must come from Congress — not from agency bureaucrats.Separation of powers is the fundamental principle of American government. https://t.co/pyYWfs10HM Skrmetti also was chief counsel to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican. “His reputation is really stellar,” Heritage’s Perry said of Skrmetti, calling him “an excellent attorney general who is highly revered.” Skrmetti received degrees from George Washington University, the University of Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Unlike in other states, Tennessee’s chief law enforcement officer is appointed by the state Supreme Court for an eight-year term, rather than elected by voters for a four-year term. (The office, whose official title is attorney general and reporter, is thus part of Tennessee’s judicial branch rather than its executive branch.) Aides and other admirers say that as attorney general, Skrmetti has spearheaded successful lawsuits against the federal government, especially leading the charge against gender ideology mandates and government overreach. Here’s a look at what they characterize as some of his biggest challenges and successes. Skrmetti’s duties as attorney general include protecting the state’s consumers, and supporters say he has risen to that task. Skrmetti filed a lawsuit against one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock Inc., in a “first-of-its-kind” consumer protection case. Tennessee successfully sued BlackRock over misleading statements about its use of ESG standards (for environmental, social, and governance considerations) in investments. Ordinary shareholders argue that ESG standards elevate over “social justice” and other progressive causes over profitability and good business practices. Skrmetti has been at the forefront of battles with progressives over gender ideology, most notably foiling the Biden-Harris administration’s proposed Title IX changes. The administration’s adjustments would have mandated that biological boys be allowed to play girls sports at school and to use girls’ restrooms and locker rooms, among other things. Despite facing several challenges from the Biden-Harris Justice Department, Skrmetti successfully defended Tennessee’s ban on so-called gender-affirming care for children. This is the case pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorney general also won a U.S. District Court case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which sought to mandate that medical providers perform, and insurers cover, some sex-change procedures. Skrmetti also went to the District Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to successfully defend Tennessee’s policy forbidding a change in the biological sex listed on birth certificates. Skrmetti also has had success in responding to the Biden-Harris administration’s undoing of border security measures imposed by the Trump-Pence administration. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border-related agencies, over its refusal to share records regarding the “catch and release” of illegal aliens who were transported to Tennessee. The case is called Tennessee v. Mayorkas, after DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Early this year, Skrmetti successfully sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its revised regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The agency’s revision would have forced employers to pay for their employees’ abortions, he argued. “I’m proud to lead the coalition fighting to protect the rule of law against this unconstitutional federal overreach,” Skrmetti said in a public statement. “Congress passed the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect mothers-to-be and promote healthy pregnancies, and the EEOC’s attempt to rewrite that law into an abortion mandate is illegal.” When it comes to government and private sector policies focused on or mandating so-called DEI—diversity, equity, and inclusion—Skrmetti has been proactive in expressing concerns. The Tennessee attorney general last year co-led a 13-state letter that warned Fortune 100 companies about DEI practices setting up racial preferences in hiring, promotions, and other decisions. “As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, both our Constitution and our civil rights laws guarantee every American the right to be free from racial discrimination,” Skrmetti said in a press release. “The court’s reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin,” he said. “Corporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing.

Bitcoin Bitcoin and crypto prices have surged this week, climbing as traders brace for a major earthquake. Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains" in the aftermath of bitcoin's halving earthquake! The bitcoin price has more than doubled over the last year, pushed higher by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto—with a surprise BlackRock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) price shock just around the corner. Now, as fears are swirling the U.S. dollar is on "the verge of a total collapse," BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (Buidl) is being used to back a new stablecoin, described as a "key milestone" in the "$16 trillion by 2030" race to tokenize finance. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has helped spark a crypto revolution on Wall Street with his ... [+] embrace of bitcoin—pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher. Crypto company Ethena, which earlier this year launched a so-called synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDe that's swelled to a $2.6 billion circulating supply, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will invest its reserves in BlackRock's Buidl via real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize. "UStb will be fully backed by Blackrock Buidl in partnership with Securitize, enabling a separate fiat stablecoin product alongside USDe," Ethena﻿'s official X account posted. "As the largest tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund with over $522 million in assets, Buidl provides UStb with a secure foundation," Securitize's account posted. "This collaboration represents a key milestone in the evolution of tokenized finance, bringing together leading innovations in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization." In May, BlackRock led a $47 million strategic investment in its Buidl partner Securitize, widely seen as a long-term bet on crypto, with the fund allowing investors within crypto ecosystems to earn dividends on the Treasury fund while keeping assets on-chain. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, helped by BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto. Fink revealed last year that he believes the tokenization of assets on blockchains will drive a "revolution" on Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenized. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune in May. "Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy." Earlier this month, a report from crypto company Chainlink found the current value of tokenized assets is almost $120 billion, with ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, holding 58% of all tokenized assets. In 2022, Boston Consulting Group found "the total size of illiquid asset tokenization globally would be $16 trillion by 2030," while in 2021, the World Economic Forum estimated that "$867 trillion of value is ready to be disrupted by tokenization."

Title: ‘This is the last Bitcoin halving that matters’ – Exec

Here’s why this crypto VC founder believes this might be last important BTC halving. Previous Bitcoin halving cycles have been followed by BTC’s price rallying explosively. This phenomenon has made most cycle analysts and the overall market expect a parabolic price rally after every event. According to a recent Blackrock report, BTC’s value has risen by 592x since its debut in 2009. Subsequent exponential returns were recorded after each of the past three halving events too. In 2013, for instance, BTC saw 555x returns, while in 2017, investors saw 104x gains. After the 2020 halving, it posted another 21x returns. And, the trend is expected to repeat after 2024’s event. Source: BlackRock However, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto VC firm Capriole Investments, believes this might be the last halving event that drives a parabolic BTC rally. He said, “This is the last Halving cycle that matters.” Edwards argued that the next halving cycle won’t impact BTC because it’s already the hardest asset, with a very low inflation rate below gold. “The next halving won’t matter much because the inflation rate of BTC is below gold. So, a massive price drop won’t affect it much.” Edwards acknowledged though that the current cycle is not yet priced amid potential nation-state adoption. However, he noted that the halving cycles will be irrelevant by 2028. “You’re not going to get massive price rallies because the halving events are so well known, and the BTC mining industry is so efficient now. I think the 4-year halving cycles will not be relevant in four years.” Here, it’s worth noting that market cycle analyst Stockmoney Lizards projected a possible price target of $200k—$260k per BTC for this cycle top. This could happen by Q4 2025. Source: X In short, there is still more room for BTC growth before it hit this cycle top. The world’s largest digital asset retested $66k on Friday and was valued at $65.9k at press time. That puts it only 8% away from its range-high at $71k.

U.Today - Michael Saylor, Bitcoin permabull and the co-founder of MicroStrategy juggernaut that stacks BTC, has published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin’s high performance, which has massively surpassed that of leading assets in conventional financial markets. Over the past few days, digital gold has demonstrated an increase of more than 5%, reclaiming the $66,000 price mark. As of September this year, BTC shows annual gains of 51%. The second largest after it comes the Magnificent 7 stocks index (which includes such monsters as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) with 27%, followed by S&P 500 (14% rise), real estate (10% increase) and gold (7%). As for the market of bonds, it has entered the red zone, plunging by 4%. Highlighting Bitcoin’s success, Saylor tweeted, “Bitcoin is winning.” On Friday, Saylor reacted to Bitcoin recapturing $66,000 by publishing a tweet saying “Bitcoin is Storm-Proof.” He also responded to a tweet by a renowned investor Raoul Pal after Pal stated that his core crypto bets include SOL and DOGE. Saylor stated that “Bitcoin misses” Pal, to which the investor replied that while he still believes in Bitcoin 1,000%, he looks for assets that can bring large profits quickly, even if high risks are involved. Since Wednesday last week, Bitcoin has added more than 10%, soaring from $59,410 after the Fed Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut first time in the last four years. This was the initial driver of the Bitcoin price, followed by a similar announcement by the Central Bank of China and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) purchasing a mammoth amount of Bitcoin this week. In the past four days, its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has seen consecutive inflows of $388.19 million in total. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Letter to the Editor: Gasparino vs. Tice

Wokeness is stuff that most Americans of all races and genders can't stand. If they ate this stuff up, Disney—which has been indoctrinating children in gender fluidity through its programming—wouldn't have a stock price that hasn't moved in eight years. Bud Light would still be the nation's No 1. beer, not No. 3, after featuring a trans woman activist in a commercial. BlackRock would be advertising its fealty to Environmental, Social, and Governance investing instead of running away from it. I would like to credit the conservative media with these wins. But a closer look at what is still a modest unwinding of woke—a sometimes overused term, but one that still so perfectly describes the progressive groupthink that seeks to remake the country and its culture into a left-wing hellhole—shows it has more to do with deep reporting by individual reporters (e.g., Chris Rufo), viral social-media moments, and everyday Americans simply exposing the perniciousness and idiocy of this ideology. The conservative media—on this issue and many others—is a little more than an opinion-generating machine, and all too often a negative feedback loop. It leaves the reporting to last and misses an opportunity to have the impact that the mainstream media still does in driving the political and cultural conversation. This may be a harsh conclusion, but it's the reason why I wanted to subject the subject to journalism in my latest book, Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. I hate the label "mainstream media," but for lack of a better word, this is a world I've occupied, working on the news side of the Wall Street Journal covering financial scandal, Newsweek when it was a major print magazine, at CNBC, where I covered the financial crisis and broke most of the major stories at that time. I've been at Fox and Fox Business with a regular column in the New York Post for the past 14 years. Some would call those outlets "conservative media," yet I never changed the way I do my job, nor do my supervisors want me to. I've written and reported all my books the same way, whether it's exposing Wall Street scams, insider trading, the roots and impact of the 2008 collapse, or how progressivism has become an integral and insidious part of corporate American culture. I engage subjects. I check facts. I question my underlying thesis throughout my reporting. I try to be fair to people I'm reporting on. My journalism moves stocks and has changed corporate behavior. In that spirit, I spent a lot of time speaking with someone at the center of corporate wokeness, a man named Larry Fink, the CEO and founder of BlackRock. Fink is maybe the most powerful financier in America given Blackrock's size: It controls more than $10 trillion in assets. That means from his office in New York City, Fink holds stocks in the world's biggest companies, currencies of every industrial power, stocks, crypto, you name it. He's also used his power to spread corporate wokeness through ESG techniques, and in the process has become a target of the conservative movement, so much so, he has backed off his allegiance to the investing technique. Why Fink initially wanted to change boardroom behavior to scale back oil drilling, proceeded to expand DEI, then reverted is a great story. To his credit, he came clean, and it makes for a fascinating read. I'm probably the only reporter who got Fink to fess up about why he went woke in the first place. Based on reader responses, my book is more compelling because of it. I did what good reporters do—I got inside the head of my subject and, in this case, explained how the most powerful man in finance arrived at the place where he shouldn't have been. But this publication's reviewer, Paul Tice, thinks this is an example of some sort of malfeasance ("Woke CEOs and the Financial Fear Factor," September 15, 2024). He accused me of using "kid glove treatment on Wall Street." I was blown away by that characterization. So was Fink, doubtlessly. (I'm told he doesn't share that view of the book's treatment of him. So too presumably was the reviewer for the Wall Street Journal, who writes, "Mr. Gasparino gives us entertaining (and informative) accounts of corporate blunders in the name of wokeness. ... Among the villains trying to ram ESG down our throats are Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock; Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase; David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs..." I don't know Mr. Tice, but I can use that invention called The Google, and here's what I found. He's a longtime Wall Street money manager. In 2009, BlackRock—yes Larry Fink's BlackRock—purchased the hedge fund he worked at. Mr. Tice remained at BlackRock until 2015. The head of the hedge fund that BlackRock purchased, Rick Rieder, stayed and is now one of the most powerful people at the firm as head of fixed income. Mr. Tice is now a critic of ESG, which is great, but his background of working at BlackRock, not for a minute, but for six years in a senior capacity, and maybe the circumstances of his departure, should have been disclosed to readers. It wasn't. He was merely described as a member of a think tank who teaches at New York University and wrote a book on ESG. Not a word about working at BlackRock and his experience working for Larry Fink. Yes, good journalism is not only about reporting, but also adding essential context. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business Network senior correspondent, New York Post columnist, and author of Go Woke, Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. Paul Tice responds: Rather than questioning my motives and qualifications for reviewing his new book, Charles Gasparino should address the substance of my criticism. In his book, Gasparino tries to make the case that Wall Street has embraced sustainability because ESG has made firms like BlackRock "uber-wealthy," even though such an argument directly contradicts the premise of his work. As his Go Woke, Go Broke title clearly states, companies that follow progressive environmental and social policies don't outperform financially and often destroy enterprise value, which necessarily means that investment firms cannot achieve better portfolio returns by pursuing ESG investment strategies. Gasparino never acknowledges this core cognitive dissonance in his book. In trying to make the case, moreover, that ESG has been a huge "moneymaker" for BlackRock—thereby causing every Wall Street competitor to follow suit—he fails to back up his argument with facts. While Gasparino correctly notes that funds carrying a sustainable label can charge higher fees, he ignores the reality that, despite all the hype, ESG funds still comprise a very small minority of assets under management (AUM) across the industry. At BlackRock, sustainable funds (excluding cash management accounts) equated to just 6 percent of total AUM at year-end 2023, with more than half of these comprised of passive ESG funds with skinnier fee structures. Nonetheless, Gasparino credits almost all the rise in BlackRock's share price over the past two decades to the firm's strategic focus on sustainability. As he writes, "It is no accident that BlackRock's stock price appreciated more than 500 percent since it offered its first ESG fund [in 2005], compared to a 272 percent rise in the S&P." Given BlackRock's transformational acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 and the protracted zero-interest rate market environment throughout the 2010s, this is a ludicrous statement. It should come as no surprise that a stock like BlackRock's with a beta well above 1.0 would significantly outperform the overall market during an extended bull run. Gasparino also attributes the sharp swing in BlackRock's AUM over 2022-2023 to changes in its public ESG stance, even though the firm's $1.5 trillion AUM round-trip over these two volatile years was entirely owing to moves in the financial markets. In 2022, when "the stench of ESG … turned off many customers" according to Gasparino, BlackRock still had $307 billion of net fund inflows, dwarfing the roughly $4 billion of capital that was publicly pulled by nine disgruntled red states that year. In 2023, Gasparino asserts that BlackRock's "assets began returning as it moved away from ESG messaging," even though no investment money had left the prior year because of ESG. Lastly, Gasparino tries to explain BlackRock's sustainability focus by highlighting the pressure placed on the firm by blue state pension fund clients such as the retirement accounts run by New York City Comptroller (and now Democratic mayoral candidate) Brad Lander. While it is true that BlackRock manages money for several progressively minded investors, Gasparino steps on his own line by using bad numbers to embellish the point. Contrary to Gasparino's claim, Lander does not play "a leading role in managing more than $20 trillion in pension money." The actual figure is $264 billion as of year-end 2023, so Gasparino is off by a factor of 75. The above nuggets provide context for my contention that Gasparino bends over backward in his book to rationalize the ESG behavior of Wall Street firms, although I was being kind when I described his analysis as hyperbole. But what do I know? I only worked in the financial industry for 40 years. I am no match for the journalism and reporting skills of Charles Gasparino.

There might only be two teams unbeaten after two rounds of the Energia AIL Division 1A come teatime this afternoon, namely the winners of the Clontarf-Garryowen and Young Munster-Terenure matches. All victorious on the opening day, Terenure will seek to back up their victory at home over the champions Cork Con when they travel to Young Munster, who themselves won away to UCD. However, Terenure last won at Tom Clifford Park in February 2017, and they travel without last week’s match-winner Fintan Gunne, due to his Leinster call-up, and also their go-to centre Peter Sylvester, who played his 50th AIL game for the club last week before moving to Miami. The experienced Alan Bennie and pacy Conor Phillips start, with Craig Adams shifting to midfield alongside Aran Egan, as the former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave is tried at 10. It’s a potent looking backline, if lacking Sylvester’s physicality. The fit-again Jordan Coughlan returns in a strong bench. Similarly, Young Munster are without last week’s double try-scorer, Shay McCarthy, as he is with Munster in Parma, injured fullback Patrick Buckley and suspended tighthead Paul Allen. Shane O’Leary, Jack Shaw and Peter Meyer come in. As Bryan Fitzgerald is also on Munster duty, Garryowen bring Jack Delaney into midfield in one of four changes for their trek to Castle Avenue, with fullback Jamie Heuston, winger Colm Quilligan and lock Oisin Cooke starting. With Aitzol King called up to the Leinster squad, Clontarf have brought in Sean Reilly, Victor Allen and Peter Maher, as Andrew Smith shifts to fullback behind an unchanged pack and halves. The other opening day winners, Ballynahinch, travel to Temple Hill where Con have brought in centre Eoghan Smith and the Munster loosehead Mark Donnelly. Lansdowne, at home to UCD, recall winger Cathal Eddy and promote flanker Paul Wilson, the Gonzaga captain in their Schools Cup win two seasons ago. The students’ suffered injuries to both scrumhalves, Rob Gilsenan and Michael Moloney, and flanker Mark Hernan. They make eight changes and two positional switches, as Bobby Sheehan moves from hooker to blindside. St Mary’s make four changes for their trip to Armagh, with Ethan Baxter replacing suspended captain Ronan Waters after his red card against Clontarf. In 1B last week’s five home winners are all on the road against sides who lost away. Nenagh Ormond travel to Blackrock while Shannon and Old Wesley, each beaten in the semi-finals last season, meet in a reprise of the promotion final two seasons ago which Shannon won, and UCC host Highfield in a Cork derby. Two of last week’s winners in 2A meet when Corinthians host Greystones. The promoted Galway club won 27-10 away to Ballynahinch last week with a pack whose oldest player is 24 and a backline, featuring double-try scoring 19-year-old Tomás Farthing, whose oldest player is 21. Free-scoring Instonians host Ballymena in their first home game in 2A for 12 years and Navan begin their centenary celebrations in earnest when hosting Old Crescent, while in 2C Sydney Parade hosts its first AIL game in 22 years when Monkstown entertain Bruff. Division 1A: City of Armagh v St. Mary’s College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Garryowen, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v UCD, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park. Division 1B: Blackrock College v Nenagh Ormond, Stradbrook; Dublin University v Old Belvedere, College Park; Naas v Queens, Forenaughts; Shannon v Old Wesley, Thomond Park; UCC v Highfield, The Mardyke. Division 2A: Cashel v Banbridge, Spafield; Galway Corinthians v Greystones, Corinthian Park; Instonians v Ballymena, Shaws Bridge; MU Barnhall v Buccaneers, Parsonstown; Navan v Old Crescent, Balreask Old.

The invaders are an army of robots that have become warped and twisted by a biomechanical virus called The Punishing. Those cybernetic marauders are the Corrupted. Driven to the brink of annihilation, the last vestige of humanity has found shelter on the space station Babylonia. It is from this orbiting outpost that you, the leader of the Gray Raven special forces unit, must amass an army and reclaim your homeland. Punishing: Gray Raven has been updated numerous times since coming out in 2021, keeping the fast-paced ARPG gameplay fresh and the player base happy. In 2023, Kuro Games released a PC client, and in the same year the studio also created an English dub.
