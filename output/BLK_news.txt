When it comes to highlighting shocking customer care in Ireland and the myriad ways readers have been let down, this page is rarely found wanting. But with it being the season of goodwill and all, we thought we might suspend our giving out for one day and instead celebrate all the soundness we’ve come across in recent times. Here are just some of the stories people have shared with us across social media platforms and via email since the start of this month. One thing that strikes us (and not for the first time) is how little it costs – in financial terms – to go above and beyond and how potentially great the returns are for businesses and people who do right by their customers. One reader, Elva, got in touch to sing the praises of All Seasons Flowers in Lucan Shopping Centre, Co Dublin. “At the beginning of November I placed an online order for a fresh door wreath and a Christmas table arrangement, with collection scheduled for Saturday, December 6th,” she said. “When I arrived, the team realised there had been a mix-up and they had prepared two wreaths instead of the wreath and the table arrangement. “They apologised profusely and immediately refunded the cost of the table arrangement.” She is undergoing cancer treatment and had been driven quite a distance to the shop by her partner as she had recently had surgery, which meant returning another day was not really an option. “I accepted the refund without any issue. However, the following day, Sunday 7th, I received a genuinely thoughtful email from the owner Emily Gaynor, apologising for the oversight and explaining it fell short of the standard they aim for, especially for orders placed well in advance for Christmas. “As a gesture of goodwill, she insisted on creating the table arrangement free of charge and arranging delivery to my home. It arrived today and it’s beautiful. “For a small business to go to such lengths after having already refunded me speaks volumes about their integrity and commitment to their customers. “In a time when good service can often feel rare, All Seasons Flowers in Lucan really stood out.” Niamh contacted us to praise the Christmas-tree sellers outside the Tesco in Newbridge, Co Kildare. “My 75-year-old mum couldn’t make the Christmas tree stand on her own, so they went up and put up the tree for her as well free of charge. I thought that was really sweet.” [ ‘Regift the bejaysus out of it’: 21 tips for a cheaper Christmas, from readers and from us ] Gina, meanwhile, had kind words for Clarkes Bakery in Cabra, Dublin, although it is more of a story of kindness on the double, really. “My husband was recently in the Mater recovering after a heart bypass,” she says. “He heard one of the nurses was celebrating a big birthday, but had to work over the next few days and wasn’t going to get out to celebrate,” she said. So Gina’s husband called Clarkes. “He ordered a large birthday cake and had planned for a taxi to collect it and deliver it to the hospital – on the phone with the bakery when everything was ordered they told him that they are a cash-only business. “But they took the order and delivered the cake on the basis that when he was out he would call in and pay for it. Of course, he couldn’t drive for weeks and when I called in to pay it was ... no big fuss. “Such a lovely kind thing and amazing customer service. They deserve a big shout-out.” Fiona had two stories to share: one from times past and another from recent days. When she was a student about 17 years ago she was getting the Bus Éireann service to Limerick from Galway to visit an aunt. “I lost my ticket and needed to get on the bus. I was really flustered and nervous. I was too broke to get a new ticket and the bus driver saw me looking anxious. When he came over to me, my face was so flushed and I explained that I lost my ticket,” she said. “He must have felt sorry for me and told me he saw me buying a ticket, which I doubted because he had just got off another bus. He said it was OK, took my bag, put it in the luggage area and told me to go on to the bus. “I was so embarrassed and grateful that I welled up when I sat down. I couldn’t believe his kindness.” Fast forward to 2025 and she has another transport story to share, this time involving Aer Lingus. “I was on an Aer Lingus flight and the woman in front of me looked so stressed. She was flying on her own with a baby and a toddler. When the flight took off, the baby kept crying and mother looked increasingly flustered,” Fiona wrote. “Later, she was trying to hold the crying baby with one hand and unzip her bag to get something for the toddler with the other hand. “The air hostess came over with a broad smile and asked if she could take the baby for a while. “She picked up the baby, kept her close to her chest, started rocking her and cooing her for about half an hour. The baby stopped crying and the mother looked so relieved and grateful. “It was lovely witnessing an act of kindness that meant so much to someone in a state of stress and anxiety. “I always find Aer Lingus have brilliant customer service and it’s not the first time I’ve witnessed an act of kindness from their staff.” Margaret, meanwhile, recently had to email Spotlight Oral Care as her toothbrush of less than a year old gave up. “I got an email requesting some details and short video of the toothbrush,” she writes. “I sent the requested info and the next email was to confirm replacement on way. It was so efficient and all within a matter of a few days. Excellent customer service.” We are big fans of the Saw Doctors on this page, so were delighted when the band – or at least someone acting on their behalf – got a shout out. “My wife and I recently brought our 14-year-old son to his first music gig – the Saw Doctors in the Olympia,” Shane wrote. “Our son hadn’t been in the theatre before so when we got in, we brought him down to the front of the standing area so he could look up and back at all the levels and boxes and see how fantastic a venue it is.” As it happens, there was a section cordoned off at the very front where they restrict numbers standing close to the stage. “As we went to make our way back into the general standing area, the floor manager (we think) came over to us and gave us wristbands so we could stand in the priority area at the front, where it would be less crowded and more suitable for our son,” Shane says. “As if that wasn’t enough, the floor manager then sought us out and came over to present our son with one of the handwritten set lists from the band to keep as a memento of his first gig. “I believe his name was Tommy K (apparently a coincidence that it was one of the Saw Doctors songs on the night) – he certainly deserves a shout-out for going above and beyond unprompted on the night.” Grainne from Galway recently needed some ties for her outdoor Christmas lights, so called to O’Higgins in Shantalla. She told the sales assistance what she needed “and he could not have been nicer. He brought me out to a big stockroom at the back of the shop. He went through all the options and said, ‘While these may not be what you are looking for, they will work’. I decided on tile clips, which did the job. “I just want to call out the time, the interest and how helpful this gentleman was. The sale came to €5, so it wasn’t as if I was a big customer with a large order, but he still gave me the time and showed interest.” She also praises Blackthorn Candles and Blazer Candles, two Galway candle companies. “I ordered candles from both above candlemakers in Galway to shop local. The candles from both places were really good quality and well made with a lovely scent. To my surprise both gentlemen arrived at my front door and delivered them personally. “Great service, great candles, great to support local companies.” Staying with fragrances, Paddy wrote in about “a small business called Handsome Scent on Stephen Street in Dublin. They do home-produced fragrances (with “inspiration-from”) some of the higher-priced shop ones. “I bought a set of three fragrances and one of them had leaked in the post. I sent a message on Instagram and they posted a new one that day and I had it the next day. “No messing, quibbles, just really good service.” [ 100 Irish websites for all your Christmas presents, from Claddagh Guinness socks to cheese ] Ciara Kelly – the one on the radio – also got in touch to highlight how a cold Christmas was once averted by the soundness of Ultima Oil in Kilpedder, Co Wicklow. She ran out of home heating oil on Christmas Eve and tells us she “left a message on Ultima Oil’s answering machine (they were finished up for Christmas) asking if we could get a delivery as soon as they reopened. “We went out for lunch and came home to a full tank they had delivered on Christmas Eve afternoon so we wouldn’t be cold. They said we could pay after Christmas. It was unbelievably kind,” Ciara said. She actually has a second story of goodwill. “Another Christmas, it was a week to go and Greystones butcher Des Doyle rang me to say I hadn’t ordered a turkey and no problem if I’d ordered elsewhere, but just in case I’d forgotten he was checking as it was the last chance to get one. I hadn’t ordered elsewhere and Des Doyle saved Christmas.” Last January reader PJ bought an air fryer from Harvey Norman in Rathfarnham, Dublin. “A couple of weeks ago it started to switch off halfway through the cycle. It was still under warranty, so they asked me to bring it in so they could have a look at it,” he says. “The unit was taken away and five minutes later the sales assistant returned with a replacement. The paperwork was sorted in minutes and she put it on a trolley and followed me out to the car. That’s what I call customer service.” Another reader, Richard, says: “There’s the best of small bookshops in Blackrock in Dublin called Raven Books. Louisa runs it and she’s an absolute gem. Helpful, knowledgeable, affable, dedicated, hard working. She’s just brilliant. “But best of all, and although some time ago now, she delivered books on her bicycle to my three kids to the door during Covid, when things were closed. They were utterly delighted by it. “I haven’t bought a book anywhere else since. She more than deserves a mention.” We also heard from a reader called Doreen, who got in touch to praise Global Windows. “The attention to detail, professionalism, courtesy and reliability is way beyond any other company/contractor who worked on our house refurbishment,” she says. “Every single contact I had from the initial sales person to the guys actually fitting the windows were a pleasure to deal with.” [ Beware the ghost of “Buy Now Pay Later” and have a savvy Christmas ] Next up is Ciara, who says she had “some niggly adult-life stuff happen recently and it always really helps when a) people are sound and b) people do what they say they are going to do”. Ciara has three good news stories to share. “During the summer, a large and heavily filled plate drawer under the hob of our fitted kitchen (new house, only three years old) locked while pulled out and refused to close,” she says. “I was away at the time and messaged the original kitchen fitter and supplier, Stuart Malcolm from Onovo. I got a quick text back from him and he confirmed he was out my way and could have a quick look. “He not only fixed the drawer, he confirmed it wasn’t overloaded by weight/amount of plates/bowls etc and continued his way around all the units adjusting the bin drawer and larder press. “Just good workmanship and he refused to take any payment. He was just sound.” That was not the only issue she had with her three-year-old kitchen. Her oven died and she went to Worrells/Expert in Malahide, Co Dublin, where she got “loads of advice and patience from Paul while we considered reconfiguring our oven(s) set-up – amending cabinetry. We didn’t in the end. “After admiring the workings of our brand new oven, I noticed the above fitted microwave door wasn’t closing properly and while he hadn’t moved it during the installation process the same guy came back to tweak the microwave for me free of charge.” And finally she tells us about “an absolute head-the-ball teenager [who] came in the exit gate of my local Dart station on a e-scooter with a girlfriend on the back, dressed in black and with no lights doing at least 30/40kph. “He screamed abuse so loud at me for bumping over his scooter, with such loud cursing that my husband left the platform and saw him leave the scene again, at speed on his scooter all at 7.30am in the dark while my car went into limp mode with sensors beeping and €1,300 worth of damage to the wheel arch, front bumper etc.” The car was repaired by “the lovely lads at Trimtech Santry who said this was a regular occurrence (and interestingly, a lot of parents were paying cash for the damage done by their unlit, uninsured and unregistered e-scooting teenagers – that’s a whole other article). “Picked up car, repaired and fully washed and fully internally valeted – so sound.” To finish, we have some shorter stories shared by users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Meadbh had a “recent interaction with Virgin Media for TV and broadband. Admitted to the billing error straight up and rectified the situation straight away. People I spoke with were absolutely sound also.” Julie says: “I think Tesco Mobile deserve the recognition for their excellent customer service. I’m with them several years and any issues I’ve ever had were sorted nearly immediately with the utmost professionalism. Their customer service is fantastic.” David applied to renew his passport on a Thursday morning “and it arrived next morning”. You can’t beat that. Denise had praise for Bloomfield Garage on Dublin’s South Circular Road. “I rang them in a panic about warning light on the dashboard of an imported hybrid. My husband was just admitted to hospice, so I was already very emotional. The owner, Paul, said, ‘Right, come in and we’ll have a look’. It was only battery in key fob, but his kindness made my day.” Our weekly personal finance newsletter will give you the insight you need to save money and make smart spending decisions © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

PHOTO: CK HUTCHISON HOLDINGS LIMITED Published Dec 22, 2025, 09:03 AM Updated Dec 22, 2025, 08:28 PM HONG KONG - Mr Li Ka-shing and his family set in motion a series of deals in 2025 that stand to completely transform his business empire. a series of deals in 2025 The Hong Kong billionaire’s flagship conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings, is pursuing three major moves: an initial public offering of its retail arm to raise at least US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) for its largest revenue contributor; a potential listing or partial sale of its global telecommunications operations; and talks to sell 43 port assets – representing the bulk of its global portfolio for more than US$19 billion in cash. The Li family, which controls about 30 per cent of CK Hutchison, believes selling and spinning off these businesses can unlock far greater value than the market currently assigns to them under the existing structure, a person familiar with the plans said. By separating the assets, the family hopes to fetch higher prices and narrow the steep discount at which the company trades relative to its net asset value. If CK Hutchison completes all these deals, it would have shed or spun off most of its core operating businesses, handing Mr Li’s elder son Victor Li – who now chairs the group – a fresh war chest to reshape the company in an era defined by trade tensions and technological disruption, including the rise of artificial intelligence. “The Li family has accumulated massive wealth over the past decades,” said Mr Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “The most important thing for the family now is to make sure that the wealth is monetised and safeguarded.” The moves mark a generational shift for one of Hong Kong’s most storied business empires. Mr Li Ka-shing built CK Hutchison into the world’s leading port operator and a major player in European telecommunications, leveraging political connections and riding on global expansion. Mr Victor Li, who took over in 2018, faces the challenge of steering the group through a far more volatile environment, where geopolitical sensitivities and regulatory hurdles loom large. In his heyday, Mr Li Ka-shing’s wealth ballooned as Hong Kong grew into an international financial hub, capitalising on China’s opening to a world that embraced collaboration and deepening trade ties. His uncanny sense of timing led to the nickname “Superman”. He expanded aggressively abroad – buying ports in Panama, building mobile networks in Britain and operating oil plants in Canada. By the early 2000s, he had built his group into the world’s largest port operator and the biggest Asian investor in European telecommunications. But the landscape has changed since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power, tightening the state’s grip on the private sector and keeping once-powerful tycoons at arm’s length. In Hong Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing and his peers are viewed with growing scepticism by Beijing, while abroad, his perceived ties with China have raised suspicions and created political hurdles for his operations – many of which sit in highly regulated industries. The Li family has lately found itself on the wrong side of the politics. The 97-year-old billionaire, who once rubbed shoulders with China’s top leaders, has fallen out of favour with President Xi. Over the past decade, state media has criticised him for selling assets in China and for remarks seen as sympathetic to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy youth. Beijing’s anger over CK Hutchison’s planned ports sale was so intense that state-owned firms were instructed to pause dealings with the Li family. “Li’s empire was built on intricate political connections he developed in the past,” said Mr Lam. “That’s not easy for Victor to inherit, because the world’s and China’s political environments have changed drastically.” According to people familiar with the family’s thinking, geopolitics was not a factor in the decision to pursue these deals. The Lis believe that restructuring the portfolio is the most effective way to bolster value. But regardless of the family’s motivations, US-China rivalry may now be the biggest obstacle to realising their plans. Talks over the ports sale have slowed amid regulatory hurdles and uncertainty surrounding the buying consortium’s structure, particularly after CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations to appease Beijing’s sensitivities over the involvement of US investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations Meanwhile, deliberations on the potential listing of retail arm A.S. Watson Group have been on-again, off-again since 2013, hampered by market volatility, while telecoms mergers frequently encounter intense antitrust scrutiny. CK Hutchison has been advised to move more cautiously with deals due to the delicate geopolitical environment, and to notify Chinese regulators on the potential retail listing because it involves operations in the country, a source said. Still, the potential deals have helped reverse depressed market sentiment, narrowing steep trading discounts to net asset value and driving a 32 per cent stock surge in 2025 – outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index. While the Li family is divesting CK Hutchison, it has been increasing its holdings in property arm CK Asset Holdings, now owning a stake of about 49 per cent. The bulk of CK Asset’s projects are located in Hong Kong and mainland China. It also operates British brewer and pub chain Greene King. “The Li family is bold in selling assets when the price is right,” said Natixis senior economist Gary Ng. “The series of moves can be a build-up of cash for acquisitions, leading to a sector shift in the company.” CK Hutchison is not alone in rethinking strategy. With Hong Kong’s global status diminished amid China’s growing influence and rising trade barriers, other storied business groups are also reshaping themselves. Jardine Matheson Holdings, a British-rooted conglomerate in Hong Kong, has been taking measures to modernise its management and accelerate divestments. Controlled for generations by the Keswick family, the 193-year-old group in recent years dismantled its long-criticised cross-shareholding structure and appointed several executives with private equity backgrounds to its top management. Its property unit, Hongkong Land Holdings, aims to raise US$10 billion over the next decade through asset disposals and spin-offs. The company is transitioning from being an owner-operator to a long-term, engaged investor, Jardine’s executive chairman Ben Keswick said in a statement for the group’s 2024 earnings report. Quiddity Advisors analyst David Blennerhassett said: “Both Jardine and CK operate conglomerates with various listed subsidiaries – and arguably they both are being proactive in extracting value.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Bessent pressures companies, wealthy Americans to help bankroll ‘Trump accounts’ as favor to the prez

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging America’s wealthy and large corporations to finance the administration’s Trump Account investment program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said Wednesday during a press conference on the initiative. “Given the amazing level of interest and the generous donations we have seen so far, I am confident we will see many more pouring in.” Trump accounts aim to give American citizens born from Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2028, an initial $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account. That money is intended to give newborns a starter fund by the time they turn 18. It was a key provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now known as the Working Families Tax Cut Act, that the president signed into law in July. Parents and guardians are permitted to donate up to $5,000 a year, and employees up to $2,500, until children become 18. With a limited long-term federal funding for Trump accounts, Bessent is urging large companies and America’s wealthy to step in and top off the nest egg before the program formally launches next summer. Earlier this month, Michael and Susan Dell committed to donating a massive $6.25 billion to the initiative, ensuring children aged 10 and under who were born before 2025 will get up to $250 in their accounts. Last week, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio announced he will donate $75 million to Trump accounts for children in his home state of Connecticut. Companies such as BlackRock, Charter Communications, Visa, Mastercard and Uber have similarly committed to making donations of their own. Bessent isn’t alone in seeking to nudge the private sector to step up. Earlier this month, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) inked a letter to the CEOs of every Fortune 1000 company pressing them to pony up. “By matching contributions for employees’ families, investing in the communities where you operate, or integrating these accounts into your philanthropic strategy, you can significantly enhance the impact of this historic initiative,” they wrote in the letter. Booker has long proposed setting up an investment account system for America’s youth, similar to Trump’s eponymous initiative. Meanwhile, Bessent is encouraging states to step up as well. “The administration has been working closely with a number of governors to determine the best way states can work with the federal government to expand access to Trump accounts,” Bessent revealed last week. “Thus far, 20 states are considering topping-up the accounts.” Advertisement

Title: Tokenization will disrupt finance faster than digital disrupted media: Crypto exec

Putting real-world assets onchain opens up new markets, increases capital velocity and democratizes access to finance, advocates say. Tokenization will transform the financial industry faster than digital technology disrupted legacy media, such as print newspapers, physical copies of music and other analog formats, according to Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments company MoonPay. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said, adding that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: Financial incumbents like Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others will continue to exist in a different form, Grossman said, much like media companies continued to exist after the shift to digital distribution in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which disrupted business models that worked for decades. Ultimately, the survivors and winners of the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance will be those companies that get ahead of the change and not those that attempt to stop the inevitable shift to a global financial system powered through blockchain rails, he said. Related: Wall Street’s $4 quadrillion backbone to roll out tokenized US Treasurys Tokenizing real-world assets carries several benefits, including enabling 24/7 access to markets, making asset classes global in scale, cheaper transaction costs through disintermediation, and lowering settlement times to minutes, instead of days. In September, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement on creating a regulatory framework to enable 24/7 capital markets. The financial system shifting to 24/7 trading represents a major departure from how traditional markets, which close on nights, weekends and holidays, currently operate. In December, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a settlement and clearing company that processed about $3.7 quadrillion in settlement volume in 2024, received approval from the SEC to start offering tokenized financial instruments. The DTCC plans to roll out tokenized assets in the second half of 2026, starting with US Treasuries and stock indexes.

Title: Dalkey woman could decide if Netflix-Warner Bros merger goes ahead

With Netflix and Paramount both vying to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the suits of the entertainment industry are on manoeuvres in Washington, seeking a kindly nod from US president Donald Trump for their billion-dollar proposals. An Irish person is involved. Gail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the all-powerful US Department of Justice is, conveniently for this column, from Dalkey, south Co Dublin. The UCD law graduate retains dual citizenship and is generating increased attention in the US as she wrestles with a slate of high-profile mergers. It’s a mixed picture for corporate bigwigs under Trump 2: some of the tough love dispensed by Joe Biden’s then-32-year-old anti-monopoly watchdog Lina Khan has dissipated and companies have resumed eating each other in pursuit of economies of scale. But that’s not necessarily popular among the meat-and-potatoes Maga masses. Slater is married to a former chief of staff to a Republican congressman from Idaho and worked as an adviser on big tech in the first Trump White House. She cuts a relatively hardline figure and has made clear that she believes in “America First antitrust”, which means standing up for “Main Street not Wall Street”, as Trump has put it in the past. The job is made harder, as the New York Times has pointed out, by the fact that Trump himself keeps taking positions on matters before the court, including saying he would be “involved” in the decision on the proposed Netflix-Warner merger. “I think a big challenge for Gail is, how impulsive will the president be?” William Kovacic, a former mergers watchdog, told Politico in a profile of Slater. “You can’t say, ‘My God, shut up,’ because then you’re fired. So you cross your fingers and hope you’re not a target.” Another person making waves abroad is author Stephen Rea – not the actor, though equally from Belfast – who has just published Ozzy & Me, a memoir of his relationship with Ozzy Osbourne. Rea grew up during the height of the Troubles and amid the chaos, including an incident during which his house was shot at by gunmen, he found refuge in music. Controversial Irish-language electro-rap troupes had not yet been invented at that stage, so he turned to the next best thing: heavy metal. Aged 15, he noticed a music magazine write-up of Rock in Rio, a giant metal festival featuring Ozzy, AC/DC and Queen set to take place in Brazil. His father, in the most magnanimous decision ever made by the father of a teenager, said they should go. Perplexed as to how to go about this, his mother wrote to Osbourne’s secretary, who promptly responded with VIP passes. Rea went, met Osbourne and struck up a 40-year friendship with the family. Rea, whose demonstrable ability to take a leap of faith has most recently taken him to New Orleans, secured a foreword from Jack Osbourne, who watchers of early 2000s MTV reality show The Osbournes will remember as Ozzy’s son, though watchers of a more recent reality TV show, I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, might know him better from that. Through decades of the metal hero’s career, Rea is in the room where it happens. At one point, in 1980s Glasgow, he recounts: “By 4am we were down to Randy [Rhoads, the bombastic lead guitarist], Geezer [Butler, bassist for both Black Sabbath and Ozzy’s solo material] , Ozzy, and me,” with “Randy throwing glasses against the wall and Geezer belting out Irish Catholic rebel tunes, Ozzy joining in though he didn’t know them.” Ozzy promises to write one for Rea. “That would have gone down well with my Protestant friends and family,” he muses. Good news for the groups of English men who often descend on Dublin to drink pints and shout at each other: JD Wetherspoon has cut a deal to supply Guinness to its Irish outlets. The divisive UK pub group, which trades on its low prices and impressive locations, has served the black stuff in Britain for a long time alongside its various curry deals and halves of Old Peculier (correct). But early in its foray into the Irish market in 2014, it decided that St James’s Gate was charging too much for its stout and struck it from the menu at the Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, south Dublin. Almost 12 years later, the deal has finally been done for its six outlets. Overheard rarely seeks refreshment at such establishments. But Guinness has been on a dramatic upsurge in popularity at home and abroad in recent years, with the Guardian even recently predicting that it will soon lose its cool in the UK – a sure sign it’s on a high. It must be surprising to stag party attendees and lost locals, therefore, to show up to Wetherspoons establishments only to be told they can’t have it, mere miles from its birthplace. A press release promises it’ll be on the menu imminently – although, of course, there are 6,000 other places you could get it all along. One tourist to Dublin this week was Greta Thunberg, the globally famous Swedish climate-and-Gaza activist who visited Áras an Uachtaráin and got up to various other activities related to her Palestinian solidarity activities. Thunberg has had a busy year, having sailed on a flotilla towards Gaza, near which she was intercepted and detained by Israel, alleging harsh treatment. A broad smile and a warm welcome from the President, therefore, given their similar interests. Overheard’s eye was caught by a striking battle scene in a painting behind Catherine Connolly and her activist visitor at Áras an Uachtaráin as they posed together. It depicts the Battle of Ballinahinch, an engagement in the 1798 rebellion. Painted by Thomas Robinson, its original title is Combat Between the King’s Troops and the Peasantry at Ballinahinch, and it is a contemporary depiction of the engagement, which saw the Presbyterian-led Co Down rebels take on the crown. Some 4,000 United Irishmen under Henry Munro lost the battle (and ultimately the war). Robinson – an English painter of Irish subjects who wowed the critics in Belfast and Dublin before dying in Jervis Street in 1810 – painted it up and it was raffled off. The Marquess of Hertford won it, but ultimately it came to the Office of Public Works (OPW) – and to the Áras, where the Lord Lieutentant Marquess Cornwallis might have mulled his troop movements many years ago. Still, despite early defeats the rebels, like President Connolly after her knockback in the Galway Labour Party, claimed victory in the end to some degree. Thunberg, aged just 22, has time yet. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Comedians can now apply for . Photo: Getty Madam — I write in response to Aidan Harte’s letter (‘Sinn Féin goes beyond satire by embracing subsidised comedy’, December 14). I have followed efforts by the members of the Irish comedy community, particularly Ailish McCarthy, to have comedy recognised as an art form. Mr Harte referred to “new spending”, but there is as yet no indication of this. What has changed is comedians can now apply for grants, along with playwrights, dancers, sculptors and painters. Until now, they were simply dismissed, because the legislation hadn’t included the word “comedy”. Incidentally, Mr Harte expressed a preference for right-wing comedy. I would encourage him to write a few right-wing zingers and pop along to an open mic and give them a go. The public will let him know if they’re funny. In terms of public funding, it’s true that not every piece of art is going to be a masterpiece, but the fact that the Arts Council supports the attempt is a good inclination towards the society I want to live in. Besides, the most successful music, art, film, video games and so on are built on the backs of fringe, often penniless, artists trying something that might inspire people. The penniless part is important there. The Basic Income for the Arts is a much-needed lifeline for the few individuals who have so far benefited from it. It was not “pushed through with little scrutiny” as Mr Harte suggested; it was trialled over an extended period, with success. There is an organisation called Minding Creative Minds that has data on just how high the rates of depression and suicide are in the arts, and it is staggering. If Basic Income for the Arts will not fix that altogether, but if it lifts the pressure and darkness off a handful of individuals and gives them the space to pay their rent and put food in their bellies and pursue the art that the very heart of them demands they do, then I think it’s an incredibly worthwhile investment. Why make it any harder for the people who just want to paint for you, or dance for you, or make you laugh? Aidan O’Sullivan, Dublin Madam — I am aghast at Ciara Kelly’s column (‘Ceasefire in Gaza may be imperfect, but to what end do we boycott and sanction Israel after the peace plan has been brokered?’, Life, December 14). I am incredulous that anyone believes now is the time to ease pressure on Benjamin Netanya­hu’s regime, simply because there’s a faux ceasefire in place that Israel violates every day. The point of sanctioning and boycotting this regime isn’t about “punishing them” for the last two years. It’s beyond belief that any observer or comment­ator on the Middle East would suggest this. The so-called ceasefire and peace plan are designed to do nothing more than encourage journalists like Ciara to write articles like the one published last week, to encourage people to move on: nothing to see here any more. We can’t move on, because that’s what the Israeli regime wants us to do. We can’t move on because the genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, human rights violations, breaches of international law, building of settlements, terrorism by sett­lers, land grabbing, abuse and torture of hostages (described by our media as “detainees”, including children), controlled starvation of Gazans continues. Sanctions allied with econo­mic, social, cultural and sporting boycotts of this disgusting regime are not just the only way to bring pressure on Netanyahu’s genocidal regime and bring about change in Israel; they are also the only morally respon­sible thing to do. Brendan Farrell, Kildare Madam — Hours after reading Michael Jordan’s egregious letter (December 14), the news came through of the Islamist killings at a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach in Sydney, celebrating Hanukkah. Michael Jordan has a problem with Jews living in Israel, their biblical homeland, where, in spite of historical expulsions and dispersions, there remained throughout history a Jewish presence. It is not possible to be anti- Zionist, anti-Israel and not be anti-Jewish. Israel, with a 77pc Jewish population, is not “an ethno­cracy”, unless the Republic of Ireland with a non-immigrant population of 78pc can be classed as such. On the contrary, both are democratic states. Ena Keye, Rathfarnham, Dublin Madam — Last Sunday, I read a letter to the editor by Michael Jordan, denying Jews the right to a homeland of their own, followed by learning of another example of “globalising the intifada” on Bondi Beach. It is sad to see the lack of historical knowledge and empathy about why Jews had to establish their own state. Frank Devine, Kenilworth, Warwickshire Madam — While the late justice minister Paddy Cooney was a great “law and order” man during the 1970s (‘Fine Gael TD and Justice Minister renowned for hard line on IRA during Troubles’, December 14), he was also liberal. The prevailing Adoption Act, a relic of 1952 as amended, in effect prevented childless couples in “mixed marriages” where one spouse was Catholic and the other of any other or no religion from adopting a child. It was the product of a very Catholic Ireland and was self-­evidently ­unconstitutional, because the State may not discriminate on grounds of ­religion. As one of a mixed marriage, albeit with our own children, I was conscious of the wounds that would befall couples in childless, mixed marriages who were not permitted to adopt. So, as a newbie to politics, I moved a proposal at the Fine Gael annual conference in Cork in June, 1972, calling for reform of the Adoption Act. It was approved. Two years later, in 1974, Mr Cooney successfully introduced the reforming legislation. Today, the civil act of adopting a child is free of religious impediment. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — I was told in my local pharmacy last week that doses of the flu vaccine were in short supply, due to demand. So why are the HSE and the Medical Council not doing more to advocate the use of face masks and more vigorous hand-sanitising? One of the most effective ways of containing flu or any other infective virus this Christmas is to wear a mask, especial­ly in crowded places or on public transport. Often the most effective solutions are the simplest. Brian Lube, Co Meath Madam — While having sympathy for people who have gender dysphoria, a solely ­activist-led approach to care would be no way to run any medical programme, which should be based on scientific evidence (‘I bear the scars of a healthcare system that fails trans people’, December 7). As the Cass Report noted, social transition is “not a neutral act”. Children do not have the capacity to consent to puberty blockers and opposite sex hormones that will affect their fertility and health for life. Trans activists may claim to want bodily autonomy, and may be supported by “progressive” politicians, but I do not think our poorly resourced health service should be removing breasts and mutilating the genitals of healthy adults, just because someone requests it. Medicine and medical treatments should always be evidence-based and doctors should “do no harm”. Helen Robinson, Blackrock, Dublin Madam — While “peace and goodwill to all men” is the order of the day at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends seeking shelter from the cold wintry winds, severe frost, foggy nights and heavy rain in our garden hedgerows. Looking out at our bird-feeder one day recently and discovering it was empty, I immediately topped it up. Almost instantly, the birds emerged from their many hiding places and descended at speed to gobble up the food. As I sat at a discreet distance, observing them as they ate heartily, a cock robin perched close by, observing the feeding frenzy, master of all he surveyed. So, as the robin adorns our greetings cards at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends who come to stay with us each year, and provide them all with a generous helping of goodies each day. Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo Madam — I agree with Sarah Breen that Australia has the right idea with its social media ban for under-16s (‘Let’s follow Australia on social media’, Dec­ember 14). As a clinician for more than 25 years, I have seen that the number of young people att­ending counselling has exponentially risen as a result of the use of phones. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — Has the role of the RTÉ Guide been usurped by the Sunday Independent? Four articles over three pages (including the front page) in last Sundays paper — are people really interested in the employment arrangements of those highly paid individuals in Montrose? Harry Mulhern, Dublin 13 Madam — It’s impressive for any institution to last 120 years, but for a newspaper it borders on heroic (‘120 years of Sundays — and some things stay the same’, December 14). The Sunday Independent has survived revolutions, censorship, political fury and commercial pressure. That alone deserves congratulations. As a child at Tullysaran Chapel, I remember the papers laid out for sale on a Sunday morning: the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press, two confident piles. No imported English scandal sheets shouting for attention, just Irish voices arguing loudly with one another. It felt like a small but important civic ritual. Over its 120 years, the Sunday Independent has informed, irritated and occasionally infuriated its readers. I read pieces that make me want to spit. That is the point. Democracy is not meant to be soothing, and freedom of speech rarely is. At a time when governments dodge scrutiny and tech olig­archs would prefer not to be accountable at all, it is journalists, in the Sunday Independent and elsewhere, who continue to ask the awkward questions. They do so under pressure, often under attack, and with diminishing resources. They deserve more credit than they get. Long may the Sunday Independent endure, and long may there be a free, unfettered press that refuses to behave itself. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In the vein of former Sunday Independent editor and fellow Kerryman Aengus Fanning’s diktat of “tell it as it is, no matter what the cost”, outlined in Liam Collins’s lively reflection of over a century of publication, I’d like to add my own tuppence worth. A few months ago, an acquaintance asked was I the McElligott that “writes” in the Sunday Indepen­dent. I replied bashfully that I have been known to fire off the odd missive. Wishing all your readers and my fellow wordsmiths a very happy Christmas. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘When politicians have to plead with judges, democracy is in danger’, December 14) frames the debate about the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as a “fight” between elected politicians and an “ideologically committed” judiciary. The contention that judiciary activism is at fault for the curr­ent deadlock is to understate the political disagreements between the 46 members of the Council of Europe. A meeting is planned for next for May to discuss the application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Normally, there would be behind-the-door diplomacy and compromise before the summit. These negotiations would form the basis of a political declaration, which the conference would ratify. The recent politic­al declaration by 26 countries, including Ireland, was high-stakes diplomacy. It is an expli­cit acknowledgment that there is significant discord. It was not a plea to the judges. It was a public power play for the May meeting. It was significant that countries such as France, Germany and Spain did not sign it. The COE statute requires “important matters”, such as political declarations, to be unanimous. A “decision” on the interpretation of the convention by the ECtHR requires a two-thirds majority, or 31 members. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Bernie Linnane refers to “the compassionate, accepting and kind Irish public who decided to trust women (regarding abortion) to make their own decision about their own bodies” (Letters, December 14). I wonder how these people view the shocking fact that more than 50,000 abortions have taken place here since the 2018 referendum, despite assur­ances by the Yes side that they would be “rare”. Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town Madam — The picture of a seated Donald Trump shaking hands with Zohran Mamdanmi accompanying Declan Lynch’s column (‘To stand up to Trump, all we need is a backbone’, December 14) raises two protocol issues. One should not remain seated while shaking hands, nor should one place one’s free hand on top of the one involved in the “shake”. Mind you, I doubt if Donald would even consider holding up his hands and admitting his gaffe. In summary, a whole lot of shaking going wrong. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont Dublin 9 Madam — Like Gerry Hickey (Letters, December 14), I have had my fill of filler phrases like “you know”. But it’s the ubiquitous “in relation to” that comes out tops with me, often occurring multiple times in the same media utterance by seasoned communicators. Tony O’Neill, Bishopstown, Co Cork Madam — I find it bemusing that politicians, chief execut­ives and others of that ilk always seem to find it necessary to start an answer with the phrase: “Let me be quite clear.” I have never heard any interviewer finish a question by stating: “I want total lack of clarity in your response.” So let’s have no more “Let me be quite clear” and just be clear.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s price rebound as BlackRock shifts $109M in ETH

Time Published: 2025-12-21T00:00:21Z

Large ETH transfers surfaced after the rally, but conviction across markets stayed thin. Ethereum’s recent rebound attracted institutional and whale attention, with several large holders moving ETH to exchanges after the rally. The activity followed ETH’s sharp move higher after the Bank of Japan’s 25 basis point rate hike. That behavior raised questions over whether large players expected near-term downside or were simply rotating capital after gains. Crypto transaction tracker Onchain Lens reported on X that BlackRock deposited 36,579 ETH, worth about $108.4 million, into Coinbase over the past 24 hours. The post also showed that BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes sent 680 ETH, valued near $2.03 million, to Binance, a move often associated with potential selling. Whale activity often draws attention because large transfers can influence short-term price direction. Traders frequently track these wallets for clues around sentiment shifts or liquidity needs. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded near $2,980, up about 0.85% over 24 hours. Spot market participation, however, weakened during the same period. Trading volume fell 52% to roughly $18.47 billion, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. That slowdown contrasted with derivatives positioning. Even so, Open Interest rose 2.46% to $38.51 billion, indicating traders added leveraged positions despite muted spot activity. That divergence suggested positioning rather than organic demand drove recent price stability. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the daily chart revealed that ETH was consolidating in a tight range between $2,790 and $3,000. Meanwhile, the broader market structure remains in a downward trend. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, a major rally in ETH would likely be possible only if it breaks out of this tight consolidation range. If the broader trend continues and the price breaches and closes a daily candle below the $2,790 level, it could trigger strong downside momentum. Conversely, if the trend shifts and the altcoin closes a daily candle above the $3,000 level, it could signal an end to the prolonged downward momentum. Besides these key levels, the momentum strength indicator Average Directional Index (ADX) has reached 30.39, above the key threshold of 25, indicating a strong directional trend in the asset. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has further reinforced the bearish outlook, as its value dropped to -0.05, signaling rising selling pressure and capital outflows from the asset.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks

The recommendation is in line with other global asset managers like BlackRock and Bank of America suggesting small portfolio allocations to the largest cryptocurrency. Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

Title: IBIT ranking 6th in 2025 ETF flows despite negative returns is ‘a really good sign’

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranked sixth in 2025 ETF inflows despite posting a negative annual return, a signal analysts say reflects long-term conviction. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has ranked sixth in net inflows despite being the only fund in the top cohort posting a negative return for the year. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows IBIT pulling in roughly $25 billion in year-to-date inflows, even as its annual performance sits in the red. By comparison, several traditional equity and bond ETFs ahead of IBIT on the leaderboard posted double-digit gains, while gold-backed ETF GLD, which is up more than 60% on the year, attracted less capital than IBIT. Balchunas described the result as a “really good sign” over the long term, arguing that the flows reveal more about investor behavior than short-term price action. “If you can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year,” he wrote, pointing to what he called a “HODL clinic” from older, long-term investors. Related: BlackRock IBIT Bitcoin ETF achieves $70B AUM record Meanwhile, one crypto market participant questioned why sustained institutional buying through ETFs has not translated into stronger price performance. In response, Balchunas suggested the market may be behaving more like a mature asset class, where early holders take profits and deploy income strategies, such as selling call options, rather than chasing immediate upside. He also noted Bitcoin had risen more than 120% the previous year, tempering expectations for continuous gains. On Friday, US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $158 million in net outflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC the only fund to post inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $75.9 million in outflows, extending their losing streak to seven consecutive days. Related: BlackRock's most profitable ETF is now a 'hair away' from $100B BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF faced heavy pressure in November, with its flagship IBIT fund recording about $2.34 billion in net outflows, including two large withdrawal days mid-month. Despite the pullback, BlackRock executives downplayed concerns. Speaking at Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo, BlackRock business development director Cristiano Castro said the firm’s Bitcoin ETFs have become one of its largest revenue drivers. He argued that ETFs are designed to facilitate capital allocation and cash-flow management, making periods of compression and outflows normal.

Title: We Have Reached the Emily Litella Moment on Climate Change

Commentary SecurityNews Commentary SocietyAnalysis SecurityNews SecurityNews SecurityNews SecurityNews SecurityNews Commentary Commentary InternationalCommentary PoliticsCommentary Health CareAnalysis PoliticsNews Health CareNews PoliticsNews PoliticsCommentary LawCommentary PoliticsNews SecurityNews Commentary SocietyCommentary International News SocietyCommentary SocietyNews PoliticsCommentary PoliticsCommentary Commentary Society Commentary Security Commentary Commentary EnergyCommentary (Bryan Bedder via Getty Images for Bloomberg Philanthropies) Michael Barone Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics. It’s been a cold winter so far in the Midwest and much of the Northeast, early-in-the-season snow even in Washington, D.C., and temperatures falling to freezing and below in much of the South. Come to think of it, North America’s 2024-25 winter was pretty cold, too. It’s gotten to the point that “polar vortex” is a phrase on just about everyone’s lips. Of course, you are surely aware—as those of us with doubts about inevitably disastrous global warming were often told—that there’s a difference between weather and climate. Weather is anecdote, climate is longstanding trend. And the longstanding trend in climate, we have been told this entire past quarter-century, is toward a hotter climate all over the world, with multiple catastrophic consequences. Now, we seem to have reached an Emily Litella moment—the moment when, on the now half-century-old “Saturday Night Live” program, the befuddled character realized that she had misheard and misinterpreted some anodyne comment and had been propounding an absurd theory, and dismissed it with a hurried, “Never mind.” Playing the Litella role this October was Bill Gates, who, as a mega-philanthropist, makes serious efforts to gauge whether the causes to which he has contributed have been worth the money. Although “climate change will have serious consequences,” he said, using the two-word phrase that replaced global warming as it was becoming apparent that Earth wasn’t uniformly warming in line with predictions, “it will not lead to humanity’s demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.” Numbered also among the converts—the use of religious metaphor is not accidental; more below—is Breakthrough Institute research director Ted Nordhaus. “I used to argue that if the world kept burning fossil fuels at current rates, catastrophe was virtually assured,” he wrote this fall in The Free Press. “I no longer believe this hyperbole.” He pointed out that the demographic and physical factors on which he based his predictions two decades ago have not come to pass, and that despite measurable warming, some of which is attributable to human activity, people have adapted, and any damage has been well short of catastrophic. As British science writer Matt Ridley notes, claims such as Al Gore’s 2006 prediction of a 20-foot sea-level rise in 20 years have fallen short—by 19 feet and 9 inches. Meanwhile, the undermining of hyperbolic scenarios has, as Wall Street Journal economics reporter Greg Ip wrote this week, led the likes of Canadian Prime Minister (and former British central banker) Mark Carney and BlackRock DEO Larry Fink to downplay the risks of climate change, as most American voters have done some time ago. In all this, I see elements of religious conversion. Advocates of drastic action to address global warming climate change tend to be secular in religion but religious in their devotion to their cause. We have sinned, with our SUVs and corporate jets frying the Earth; we must atone by reducing our (or others’) standards of living; we must faithfully perform daily rituals, adjusting our thermostats and sorting our trash for recycling. The science writer John Tierney reports that The New York Times received a record number of letters in response to his 1996 article that it was economically and environmentally wasteful. It was like telling traditional Catholics their rosaries were a waste of time. For many Americans of a certain age, any change in the climate they remember from the summer when they were 16 is a change for the worse, just like any change from the playlist of songs they remember from that glorious summer. Satellite radio programmers and canned music providers in shopping malls provide the music from that golden moment, and politicians promising to halt climate change promise to provide the golden weather. But my impression is that those musical offerings are, like the baby boomer generation, getting scarcer, and certainly the demand in the political marketplace for restoration of that golden summer’s weather climate seems to have grown weaker too. This is operating within a larger cultural trend, an increasing skepticism of science and scientists. Earlier this month, as a Wall Street Journal editorial was among the few to emblazon, the journal Nature retracted a study that projected climate change could lead to a 62% economic decline by 2100. Among the factors that skewed the results threefold was the 1995-99 data from Uzbekistan. You can almost hear Litella saying, “Never mind.” Such shoddiness seems amusing, at least until you consider the “replication crisis” in which scientists have been unable to replicate the results of dozens of peer-reviewed and journal-published experiments, some of them famous like the Stanford prison experiment. And then there was the effort, successful during the COVID-19 crisis, by National Institutes of Health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, to suppress the now generally accepted theory that the virus spread because of a leak from the lab in Wuhan, China, whose gain-of-function research, deliberately strengthening viruses, was subsidized despite a ban by former President Barack Obama in 2014. So, the public’s skepticism of science and scientists is not surprising, though it’s surely having some unfortunate effects. People can see that expert recommendations, pushed by teachers unions, to close schools despite children’s negligible COVID-19 risk have resulted in long-lasting learning loss. And they are seeing one prominent preacher after another of environmental doom from climate change suddenly saying, like Litella, “Never mind.” COPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM We publish a variety of perspectives.

Sullivan & Cromwell, known for its anti-trust expertise, will work alongside Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld which the creditors had retained earlier, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. The US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire stunned credit markets when it sued lenders including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc. last month, alleging a so-called cooperation agreement that they’d struck amounted to an “illegal cartel.” The lawsuit, the first of its kind to be brought by a borrower, thrust the legality of the pacts, which are designed to give bond and loan holders more leverage by negotiating as a bloc rather than individually, into the spotlight. Representatives for Sullivan & Cromwell, and for the group of lenders to Altice USA, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Altice USA also didn’t immediately respond. Altice USA — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — has struggled under a heavy debt load. The firm has been working with Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, a law firm known for its antitrust expertise and also the architect behind the lawsuit. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, along with PJT Partners, which is also advising the creditor group being sued, said on a call with lenders last month that the lawsuit has no merit, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Another XRP Milestone: Ripple Exec Celebrates RLUSD Anniversary With $1 Billion Market Cap

Time Published: 2025-12-19T21:00:08Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin RLUSD has reached a $1 billion market capitalization just one year after launch, marking another milestone for XRP and the broader Ripple ecosystem. The milestone was highlighted by Ripple executive Jack McDonald, who pointed to a combination of regulatory compliance, institutional infrastructure, practical usage, global expansion, and multichain interoperability as the key factors driving RLUSD’s growth. Together, these developments justify the stablecoin’s rapid ascent. RLUSD’s rise to a $1 billion valuation on its first anniversary was shaped by deliberate structural decisions before launch. Ripple designed the stablecoin to operate within U.S. regulatory frameworks, combining state-level licensing with federal oversight via the OCC’s conditional approval of its national trust bank charter. This dual-layer compliance gave financial institutions immediate clarity on governance, reserve management, and operational standards, paving the way for quick adoption. As institutional demand grew, RLUSD issuance expanded in line with actual usage, helping it surpass the $1 billion market cap in November 2025 and secure a position among the top five USD-backed stablecoins globally. Confidence in the stablecoin was reinforced through robust infrastructure choices: Ripple selected BNY Mellon to custody RLUSD reserves, while Deloitte’s independent attestations provided transparency into its backing and operational controls. These measures strengthened institutional trust and enabled RLUSD’s steady expansion into professional financial environments. Moreover, within Ripple’s ecosystem, RLUSD complements XRP by providing a regulated dollar instrument for settlement, liquidity management, and institutional treasury functions, while XRP continues to support cross-border transfers and on-chain liquidity. Together, two assets form an integrated framework that has underpinned RLUSD’s expansion and milestone achievement. Beyond compliance, RLUSD’s growth has been driven by practical adoption and real-world financial usage. The stablecoin serves as a 24/7 off-ramp for tokenized products, including funds issued by BlackRock and VanEck, allowing smooth movement between tokenized assets and traditional cash positions. Its role extends into capital markets activity, with repo trades and money market fund operations enabled through partnerships with global banks and asset managers, embedding RLUSD directly into institutional workflows rather than peripheral use cases. RLUSD’s international footprint has expanded alongside its domestic adoption. Recognition in financial hubs such as Dubai (DFSA) and Abu Dhabi (FSRA) enables cross-border operations while maintaining regulatory consistency. Ripple has also extended RLUSD across multiple layer-two blockchain networks, including Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain via Wormhole’s NTT standard, increasing interoperability and access to liquidity throughout the ecosystem. By its one-year anniversary, RLUSD has established itself as a core component of Ripple’s financial infrastructure, demonstrating that trust, compliance, structural design, institutional adoption, and cross-chain expansion can drive rapid, sustainable market growth while achieving a top-five USD stablecoin status.

Title: Christopher Waller has ‘strong interview’ with Trump for Fed chair job: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/19/business/christopher-waller-has-strong-interview-with-trump-for-fed-chair-job/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T19:37:23Z
Full Content:
President Trump interviewed Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller as the White House zeroes in on a short list of four contenders to succeed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, according to a report. Waller had a “strong interview” with Trump that focused heavily on the labor market and ways to jump-start job creation, two senior officials familiar with the meeting told the financial news channel CNBC. The interview took place inside the president’s residence and wrapped up shortly before Trump addressed the nation on the economy Wednesday night. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino were also present, officials told CNBC. The positive assessment of Waller’s sit-down did not mean he has emerged as the favorite, officials cautioned, but it underscored that Trump’s decision-making process remains active and structured as he weighs who will replace the current Fed chair. Administration officials told CNBC that the candidate list has narrowed to four: Waller; National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett; former Fed Gov. Kevin Warsh; and BlackRock fixed-income chief Rick Rieder. Rieder is scheduled to interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago during the last week of the year. Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman is no longer under consideration, officials said. Hassett and Warsh have already been interviewed by Trump, leaving Waller and Rieder as the final two candidates yet to complete the process. Officials told the conversation with Waller centered on jobs and the health of the labor market, pushing back on criticism that Trump is seeking a Fed chair who would simply heed the president’s diktats on interest rates. They told CNBC that Trump’s interviews with candidates as “broad-based across a series of economic issues,” not narrowly focused on rate cuts. That framing contrasts with Trump’s public remarks last week, when he told the Wall Street Journal the Fed chair should consult with him on interest rates. “It doesn’t mean — I don’t think he should do exactly what we say,” Trump said at the time. “But certainly we’re — I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.” Trump again praised Waller on Thursday when asked about the Fed governor in the Oval Office. “I think he’s great. I mean, he’s been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with,” Trump said. Trump interviewed Waller in 2019 and later nominated him to the Federal Reserve Board. In his speech Wednesday night, the president said: “I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.” Waller has publicly aligned himself with that direction in recent months. Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday at the Yale CEO Summit in New York — before his meeting with Trump — Waller said he believes interest rates could fall by 50 to 100 basis points below current levels. He said he expects inflation to continue easing and expressed concern about a weakening labor market. “President Trump remains committed to nominating the best and most qualified individuals to turn the Biden economic disaster around. Until an announcement is made by President Trump, however, any reporting about the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. Waller didn’t respond to a request for comment. Advertisement

Title: Unauthorised modular homes in south Dublin must be torn down, judge orders
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/19/unauthorised-modular-homes-in-south-dublin-must-be-torn-down-judge-orders/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T18:35:28Z
Full Content:
A builder and a site owner, held to be responsible for an unauthorised residential development at Brittas, Co Dublin, have been directed to tear down all illegally built houses and re-landscape the area to its original condition. In the Circuit Civil Court on Friday, Judge John O’Connor threw out claims by the developers that the works constituted refurbishment of existing properties and said he considered them to be “entirely new” structures. “Even on their own evidence they have demolished the existing structures and taken them down to a concrete base,” he said in a reserved judgment. Judge O’Connor was referring to the building of 29 modular homes which, it had been alleged, appeared to be phase one of an intended development of 71 residential units at Chianti Park and an adjoining site. South Dublin County Council and a local resident, John O’Neill, who lives only 200m from the developments, had claimed it was unauthorised and that all units should be removed with the sites restored. Their applications had been opposed by Branach Developments Ltd, the developer, with a registered address at Thomastown, Caragh, Kildare, and the site owners, Mullnassa Limited and Threshford Limited, both with registered addresses at Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin. Judge O’Connor had initially intended to deliver his judgment next February. However, he brought it forward when a solicitor from Burns Kelly Corrigan, for Mr O’Neill, went into court this week with photographs of continuing development work going on in an alleged breach of an undertaking not to progress building works. About 29 homes had been constructed to date on the site, formerly used for mobile homes and chalets, with foundations laid for at least 12 more. Judge O’Connor said on Friday he did not agree with the developers and site owners’ view that the works were refurbishments and, while they were residential, it was clearly an intensification of the use of the site. He said the developments consisted entirely of new structures. “It is, in fact, a very serious redevelopment and transformation of the site without planning permission,” he said. Photographs alone were sufficient evidence of the transformation of the site to a new development. He said the prior structures may have been dilapidated but that did not mean the work could go ahead without planning permission before the development commenced. He said it was of significant concern to the court that, notwithstanding the local authority having acted promptly in respect of the development, that once the proceedings had been initiated, the respondents in contrast had not only continued their development works but had intensified their building. It must have been abundantly clear to them that they had been taking a very significant risk, he said. Mr Michael O’Donnell SC, counsel for the developer and site owner, told Ms Justice Emily Farrell in the High Court on Friday afternoon that Judge O’Connor’s decision was being appealed. She granted a stay on Judge O’Connor’s directions until 6pm on Monday to facilitate the fitting of a membrane to weather proof stocks of plaster board on the site.

Title: How will tokenised assets change in 2026? The march towards a $35tn market starts now
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/tokenisation-race-to-heat-up-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T17:52:35Z

About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in our The Roundup newsletter on December 19. Sign up here. Hi! Eric here. Tokenisation is becoming the next frontier in Wall Street’s aggressive campaign to bulldoze into crypto. In 2025, centralised players like Robinhood, Kraken and Superstate launched tokenised stocks on their platforms, enabling 24/7 trading of digital exposure to company shares. That’s just the beginning, industry insiders tell DL News. “In 2026, the tokenised assets market becomes broader, deeper, and significantly more institutional,” Philipp Pieper, co-founder of tokenisation platform Swarm Markets, told DL News. He and others expect tokenisation to veer more deeply into private markets, which include assets like private equity and credit, and have so far mostly been the purview of institutional players. This will give retail investors access to a market that investment giant BlackRock estimates will grow by 53% to be worth $20 trillion by 2030. Other areas primed for onchain adoption include public market assets such as equities, exchange-traded funds, indices, commodities, and yield-bearing instruments. This combination will drive a thousand-fold growth of tokenised assets, pushing their combined value to $35 trillion by 2030, according to Grayscale. The bullishness around tokenisation highlights how traditional finance has merged with that of crypto. Digital assets were once treated like the unwanted stepchild of finance, but a combination of regulatory clarity, political will, and industry maturity has triggered a wave of institutional buy-in. Wall Street giants have ploughed billions into crypto ETFs, considered launching their own stablecoins, and are tapping into blockchain infrastructure like never before. So far, tokenisation efforts have mainly resulted in walled gardens where traders can only buy and sell digital exposure to assets like shares on each platform. “Fragmentation remains the biggest challenge [to tokenisation],” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, told DL News. This, he said, prevents tokenisation from reaching “its full potential when assets are open, interoperable, and easy to move between centralised and decentralised environments, while remaining fully collateralised by the underlying assets.” Another challenge for tokenisation will be regulatory clarity, for instance around geolocking where products have different regulatory requirements depending on where they are in the world. “Once we have a clear regulatory framework for crypto in place, I think we will see faster adoption and innovation across the industry,” Johann Kerbrat, SVP and GM of Robinhood Crypto, told DL News. Even so, most industry insiders DL News spoke to view 2026 with a sense of bullish anticipation. “We’re moving from pilots to infrastructure,” Jim Hiltner, co-founder of Superstate, told DL News. “Tokenised assets will start to look less like a niche category and more like a new operating layer for capital markets.” Artificial intelligence will trigger an economic boom in 2026 not yet captured by official statistics, propelling crypto markets to new highs unlike in previous cycles, Coinbase says. Lance Datskoluo reports. Prediction markets have become a leading indicator for pivotal economic data — and traders are monitoring them to get ahead in the market, Tim Craig reports. Strategy’s chief executive Phong Le predicts 2026 will unleash a wave of Bitcoin buying. The boss of the digital asset treasury firm made that prediction on the back of Strategy buying another $980 million in Bitcoin in the second week of December at an average price of $92,000 per coin. Pump.fun and its partners, including Solana Labs, were sued earlier this year for allegedly operating an unlicensed casino. This week a US federal court turned up the heat a notch by permitting a class-action lawsuit to be amended to include over 5,000 internal chat logs as evidence. https://t.co/YEJ11oimxP pic.twitter.com/KVqrCkLja9 https://t.co/YEJ11oimxP pic.twitter.com/KVqrCkLja9

RTÉ Sport journalist SUNDAY All-Ireland SHC semi-finals Loughrea v Sleacht Néill, Parnell Park, 1.30pm Ballygunner v St Martin's, FBD Semple Stadium, 3.30pm TV Both games will be broadcast live on TG4. ONLINE Live updates of both games on RTÉ.com/sport, followed by reports and reaction on RTÉ.ie and the RTÉ News app. RADIO Live commentaries and updates on Sunday Sport on RTÉ Radio 1 and Spórt an Lae on RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta. WEATHER Cooler than recent days with showery rain moving in across the country on an easterly breeze, with the chance of the odd wintry shower. Highest daytime temperatures of 4 to 8 degrees. For more, visit met.ie With one All-Ireland title and just two final appearances between them, Sunday’s All-Ireland hurling semi-finals may appear novel on the surface, but they bring with them a fair bit of familiarity too. Waterford’s Ballygunner are making their fifth appearance at this stage in just eight years – and Covid saw the competition nixed in 2020. Derry’s Sleacht Néill are undoubtedly the kings of Ulster and this is their sixth attempt at reaching a first ever final in the last decade. They’ve come incredibly close on a number of occasions. Galway’s Loughrea were here last season although it is at least a new experience for Wexford’s St Martin’s. Gunner using media for ammunition When Ballygunner eased past Éire Óg in the Munster final to set up a semi-final with St Martin’s, Dessie Hutchinson picked up his latest player of the match award and told TG4 afterwards that "a certain Clareman said we were a dying team". Sherlock Holmes didn’t need to be drafted in to solve that one, with Anthony Daly the obvious culprit. To be fair to 'Dalo’, the quote wasn’t just as pointed as he pondered "are Ballygunner the team they were? They looked to be against Sarsfields but I would argue that they are not quite" before that game with the Clare champions. Daly also listed it a 60-40 final in favour of Ballygunner, but they made a mockery of that with a 0-21 to 1-09 victory to move to the top of the provincial roll of honour. There is no doubting Ballygunner’s brilliance, but five previous Munster wins have been converted into just one All-Ireland title – and even that took that incredible goal from Harry Ruddle in the 2022 final win over Ballyhale. Of the teams just below them in the Munster roll of honour, Blackrock have won three All-Ireland titles from five provincial successes, St Finbarr's two from four and Glen Rovers two from three. Much healthier conversion rates. Manager Jason Ryan will have been targeting the Tommy Moore Cup from the moment he joined the club, even if that remains an internal thought. Some criticism in the media – perhaps even if taken in a slightly different way than intended – can't hurt. That motivation, of course, is supplemented by extreme talent with Hutchinson in supreme form. Since opening his championship season with 1-09 against Abbeyside in July, he has racked up 9-70 in 11 games. Philip Mahony is perhaps the best sweeper in the club game while Patrick Fitzgerald is firing at the right time. Paddy Leavey has been a revelation and the team’s ability to dominate the puc-out has been critical to their success. Ballygunner have never faced Wexford opposition competitively before, but perhaps Ryan – a former Model County football boss – may have a valuable insight or two on the county. St Martin’s won’t be overawed St Martin’s will head to Thurles to face Ballygunner fully convinced that they can end the season of another big-hitter. Ballyhale were the victims last time out as the Wexford side claimed a first-ever Leinster title, and it shouldn’t be forgotten that they took out All-Ireland champions Na Fianna in the provincial quarter-final. Both those wins came by a point – so their grit certainly can’t be questioned. Ben Stafford was the hero last time out, the player coming off the bench to grab the sensational winner against Ballyhale having also plundered a late, late score in the closing surge against Na Fianna. "Ben Stafford, number 21!" A phenomenal late score has won the Leinster title for St Martin's. What an incredible game at Croke Park. Ballyhale are beaten. pic.twitter.com/b78nqhdB9u The O’Connor brothers have been in sensational form too in what has been a busy period for the siblings with Rory marrying former Kilkenny camogie star Grace Walsh a week after the Ballyhale match as Jack took on the best man duties. 'I do’ last week, ‘I believe’ this week, with Rory O’Connor making it very clear that they are not satisfied with their lot. "I think it’s a coming of age for our team," he said ahead of this semi-final. If there was one concern for manager Daithí Hayes, it’s that their goal-scoring rate has plummeted in the Leinster series with three games bringing just one green flag – Barry O’Connor against Na Fianna. In Wexford, they had managed 17 in eight games, so they’ll hope that touch returns at Semple Stadium. Sleacht Néill chasing that final step Sleacht Néill have swept all before them in Derry with 13 straight titles, and they have superseded the Antrim fraternity as Ulster’s top dogs with six of the last nine provincial crowns, but 2025 has always been about scratching one particular itch – making it to an All-Ireland final with Loughrea standing in their way this time around. Some of the squad, including the returning Chrissy McKaigue, have been there twice with the club’s footballers, but when it comes to the small ball, it’s been a series of entertaining losses – no consolation, of course. A Con O’Callaghan-inspired Cuala suggested they were maybe out of their depth on their first visit to this stage in 2016, but 12 months later they gave Na Piarsaigh their fill of it. Ballyhale, Ballygunner and Sarsfields – with Mark McGuigan missing a golden chance at the death to win it - have all been pushed to the pin of their collar in the intervening years and there is a sturdiness about the Robert Emmet’s this term that should worry their opponents. Manager Paul McCormack, a Sam Maguire winner with Armagh in 2002, will understand the significance of McKaigue’s return, one of nine players with six Ulster medals. Part of the Derry football coaching staff, McKaigue has been operating in a much more advanced role than he is accustomed to with fellow dual stars Shane McGuigan and Brendan Rogers providing plenty of class coming from deep. Watch out for Ruairí Ó Mianáin too, a ferocious young talent. This is their first time facing Galway opposition. Three of the last four Ulster sides to reach the final have managed it by beating Tribe opposition at this stage. Loughrea aiming to make amends Twelve months ago, Loughrea hadn’t been behind in their All-Ireland semi-final with Na Fianna for the first 56 minutes. When the whistle went a few minutes later, they’d be one point short. That the Dublin side went on to lift the Tommy Moore Cup – and in comfortable fashion too against Sarsfields – would have been hard to stomach, but the passage of time would have allowed them to turn that feeling into the positive notion that they are not far away. The Galway Championship is one of the most competitive about with five All-Ireland winning clubs involved in 2025 – Portumna and Kiltomer didn’t feature in Senior A this term – so to go back-to-back is a real achievement, especially as it was the first time in the club’s history. They had to come through the preliminary quarter-finals after a group defeat to Craughwell, and there was a one-point quarter-final win over Clarinbridge. Drama in the county final too, as Darren Shaughnessy’s late goal saw them past St Thomas’ as they retained the Tom Callinan Cup for the first time. Loughrea have played Ulster opposition once – back in the 2007 semi-final with Vinny Maher securing safe passage with a late goal. They've had a long wait without competitive action for their second meeting with a side from up north, and they'll need to be sharp from the off against game opposition. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: ‘Think Again’ Before Selling Your XRP; Expert Tells Investors
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/think-again-before-selling-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T17:00:47Z

Crypto pundit Finance Bull has advised XRP investors against selling their holdings now despite the market downturn. This came as the pundit explained that the CLARITY Act could pass next year, which he predicts will positively impact the altcoin’s adoption. In an X post, Finance Bull told XRP investors to think again if they are considering selling their coins right now. He reminded them that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the CLARITY Act is expected in early 2026, which the pundit indicated will benefit the token when that happens. Finance Bull explained that when the CLARITY Act passes, Ripple will be forced to declare the fate of its XRP in escrow, and that when that happens, the company won’t sell its holdings. Instead, he predicts that they will pre-allocate it to bank corridors, sovereign rails, liquidity hubs powering cross-border settlement, institutional infrastructure, and countries integrating next-generation payment rails. Finance Bull further remarked that this flips the entire conversation, as what looks like overhead supply is already reserved, meaning that XRP won’t face a sell-off as some investors may fear. He added that the real move is locked liquidity flowing into banks, FX routes, and custody frameworks, which would boost the altcoin’s adoption. The pundit stated that this isn’t about market-making but about monetary wiring and that once Ripple releases its official escrow roadmap, the re-pricing will be instant, irreversible, and demand-driven. Interestingly, Finance Bull claimed that BlackRock will be one of the institutions that will adopt the altcoin when there is regulatory clarity through the CLARITY Act. Notably, BlackRock is one of the crypto ETF issuers that has yet to file for a spot XRP ETF, but the pundit has suggested that could change soon. In a press release, Ripple announced a strategic partnership with TJM Investments, providing a boost for XRP’s adoption. The crypto firm stated that under the terms of the partnership, it has invested in THM and will continue to provide best-in-class infrastructure to support TJM’s execution and clearing services. This builds on the existing relationship between Ripple’s multi-asset prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime, and TJM. Ripple stated that the expanded partnership will enable TJM offer its clients improved capital and collateral efficiency as well as enhanced clearing stability and balance-sheet support. This development comes as Ripple continues to explore ways to enhance the utility of RLUSD and XRP. The firm recently announced plans. The firm recently announced plans to begin testing RLUSD on Base, Optimism, Unichain, and Ink. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $1.80, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Texas: Why Not Monetize Everything?

In Greg Abbott’s Texas, everything has a price or makes a profit. Mothers Against Greg Abbott posted this video showing how it’s done. A for-profit online charter school is opening in a for-profit prison whose inmates are families arrested by ICE. The school will be supplied by a giant online corporation called Stride, which used to be K-12 Inc. K-12 Inc. was known for low-quality instruction, low graduation rates, and scandals. Its executives are paid multi-million dollar salaries. It’s ironic that the government is paying Stride to provide low-quality online instruction to hapless children whose families are about to be ousted from America. Peter Greene has the story here. The detention center in Dilley is operated byCoreCivic, a Tennessee-based for-profit operator of prisons, jails, and detention centers. In 2025, they scored $300 million in ICE contracts. CoreCivic was founded as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) in 1983, by Thomas W. Beasley, Robert Crants and T. Don Hutto. Beasley served as the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party; Crants was the chief financial officer of a real estate company in Nashville; Hutto was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association, and according to a 2018 Time Magazine investigation, ran a Manhattan-sized Tennessee cotton plantation where Black convicts picked cotton for no pay… One of its first big investors was Michael Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” In 1996, he had established Knowledge Universe, an organization he created with his brother Lowell and Larry Ellison (Oracle), who both kicked in money for K12. Steve Fink, a trusted Milliken confidant and lead independent director of Stride, is the brother of Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, which has been a longtime investor in Stride. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about“the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” Well, who cares? Who cares if Stride-K12 provides high-quality education? So what if it’s a waste of taxpayer money? The “students” are children who are being deported. Their parents are being deported too. Who cares? Thank you, Diane – the real question is how to stop these people so that they can’t revive, like some Dracula. Martha Ture Mt.

Big companies are shameless profiteers.https://substack.perfectunion.us/p/how-data-centers-are-driving-up-your LikeLike “ran a Manhattan-sized Tennessee cotton plantation where Black convicts picked cotton for no pay…” This history needs context. The convict lease system was the order of the day when labor was never enough. The labor required to pick enough cotton to be profitable created a permanent underclass n the cotton belt until the advent of the mechanical harvesting of cotton. That underclass included newly freed slaves, whose fate was often to be arrested for misdemeanors and pit into a system designed to trap them and use them for either county finance or personal gain or both. This system largely survived any attempts at reform on a governmental level, but buckled as labor became unneeded. Today a single man sitting in a million dollar machine harvests acres per hour, which makes the use of slave labor and its companion, the worker kept on penury, obsolete. What we have replaced this system with in Core Civic is the monetization of warehousing human beings. If you know a bunch of people on your community, you will probably know someone caught in the web of the system that makes some people wealthy. When it is profitable for people to be put in jail, more people will go to jail. Their presence in jail puts money in a thick wallet, and does not reward the private prison for doing a good job. These prisons, some corporate and others state run, now provide a significant number of communities with their many n source of income. Trust me. In Tiptonville, Tennessee, the prison is about your only job unless you sell groceries to a person working in the prison. Horrible situation.

Title: A 10-Hour Data Center Outage Is Testing the Ambitions of KKR, GIP

Time Published: 2025-12-19T14:15:54Z
Full Content:
Data center operators are fixated on the “five nines” — an expectation that they’ll keep the infrastructure behind financial markets, e-commerce and artificial intelligence running 99.999% of the time. So as news rippled out last month that a CyrusOne facility in Aurora, Illinois, that handles trillions of dollars in trading volume each day went down for 10 hours, industry insiders were stunned. To them, it was an eternity, and the failure at the data center outside Chicago is a black eye for CyrusOne’s backers. KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners, now a unit of BlackRock Inc., announced their acquisition of CyrusOne in 2021 for $15 billion. They secured billions more in financing for the firm as they deepened their foothold in a booming industry increasingly dominated by the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. Data centers, the physical embodiment of the AI revolution, are one of the hottest bets in private markets. But as the debate rages over whether the boom is a bubble — debt levels and valuations are climbing — the challenges for Wall Street can be much more tangible: from cooling the space to literally keeping the lights on. KKR pursued the investment for years and was the driving force behind the deal as it worked to rope in various bidding partners. CyrusOne touches several of the private equity firm’s major units. Last year, KKR led part of a $7.9 billion loan to the data center operator, co-arranged by its own capital markets team and funded by its Global Atlantic insurance arm alongside some of its clients. And KKR owns its CyrusOne stake through its infrastructure and real estate funds, as well as Strategic Holdings, a unit that holds long-term investments on the firm’s balance sheet. All that cash wasn’t enough to stave off disaster at Aurora, an older property in CyrusOne’s portfolio of more than 55 operational data centers. A series of missteps by facilities workers at a site running on older systems led to a major outage for CME Group Inc. Such incidents typically require the data center operator to compensate the client, according to people familiar with the industry. CME entered a 15-year lease at the Aurora data center in 2016, according to a prior announcement. “They will need to double down on becoming a resilient data center because this is a failure that happened and shouldn’t have,” said Andrej Danis, head of AlixPartners’ Americas telecommunications and digital infrastructure practice. KKR and GIP said they’re confident in CyrusOne’s strategy and that it’s poised to benefit from growing demand. “Under our ownership, CyrusOne has accelerated its expansion, enhanced its competitive position while deepening its commitment to innovation, and reinforced its standing as a premier developer and operator of mission-critical data centers,” Waldemar Szlezak, KKR’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, said in an emailed statement. Will Brilliant, GIP’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, echoed Szlezak’s remarks in a separate statement. “We fully support CyrusOne, as we have done throughout our ownership, to invest significant resources to maintain a leading position as a provider of critical data center development and operations services for its customers,” Brilliant said. For Wall Street, the stakes are high. Data centers are a key focus for KKR’s infrastructure business, one of the fastest-growing and best-performing strategies for the firm, which is led by Co-Chief Executive Officers Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. GIP, which announced in October that it was making a bet on developerAligned Data Centers, is central to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s ambitions to expand the $13.5 trillion money manager beyond its stock-and-bond roots into more lucrative realms. n backing CyrusOne, KKR and GIP took on a dot-com-era company with a complex history. Cincinnati Bell acquired the firm from Abry Partners, before spinning it off. CyrusOne then made strategic takeovers of data centers from other companies through deals with firms including Cervalis, Sentinel Data Centers and Zenium. The Aurora data center, acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction with CME, gave CyrusOne a foothold in financial services. Knitting together assets from various deals was a complicated undertaking. As a public company, CyrusOne was wrestling with activist investor Jana Partners and leadership turnover. After longtime CEO Gary Wojtaszek departed in 2020, the company was run by a variety of successors with short tenures. They include Tesh Durvasula, an interim CEO for less than a year; Bruce Duncan, who had no prior data center experience; and David Ferdman, a co-founder who was asked to return to lead the company through the latest ownership transition. While CyrusOne received interest at various points from about a dozen parties, some prospective investors were discouraged by the management churn. Blackstone evaluated the company but never entered serious discussions, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks were confidential. Blackstone declined to comment. After KKR and GIP swooped in, they took board seats and installed Eric Schwartz as CEO. Schwartz was comfortable maintaining a lower profile than other data center CEOs, industry associates said. And he stuck with decisions that had been made before him, including one to outsource facilities operations at roughly 50 North American data centers to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That move, set in motion by Wojtaszek, divided top executives, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some argued it would help the firm offer a standardized playbook across properties, while others worried it would erode the quality of service, people said. Rivals such as QTS don’t outsource facility operations, other people said. Wojtaszek didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. Some would-be tenants opted to take their business elsewhere in part because they weren’t comfortable with CyrusOne having fewer in-house boots on the ground in case of an emergency. CyrusOne maintains oversight of operations at its data centers while tapping third-party personnel for support, another person said. Other data center companies have such arrangements, too. Industry executives said the shift showed how CyrusOne was moving further away from its roots as a data center operator to become more of an asset-gathering operation to benefit financial backers. KKR and GIP’s arrival accelerated changes at CyrusOne. The company focused on building from the ground up — and at scale. It benefited from a push by big technology firms to tap data center landlords for infrastructure and power to train AI models. But even with the AI boom in full swing, CyrusOne fell behind in market share to more dominant players like QTS in recent years, according to some industry rankings. Things came to a head at the Aurora data center on Thanksgiving, when a cascade of missteps by workers there collided with the reality that the roughly two-decade-old facility ran on outmoded architecture and didn’t automate critical functions. A day earlier, onsite staff and contractors switched the data center’s cooling towers, which keep the machines from overheating, to a new operating mode to prepare them for cold weather, according to a confidential report reviewed by Bloomberg. That transition failed to adhere with protocol and higher temperatures overwhelmed the cooling system. A spokesperson for JLL did not have immediate comment when reached by email. Initial remediation work only made the problem worse, according to the report. As heat built up, the chips and computers powering critical market functions couldn’t operate. Industry executives said the incident shows what can happen when data centers use outdated cooling technology and lack both the basic automatic controls for temperature and automation systems that can override human lapses. Meanwhile, CME didn’t have the ability to keep trading functions up and running seamlessly and opted against initiating a complex disaster recovery plan to shift operations to a secondary data center in the New York area. The money managers behind CyrusOne remain all-in on the AI boom. KKR recently struck a deal with Compass Datacenters to take a stake in a pool of data centers. Last year, the firm reached a $50 billion pact with Energy Capital Partners to develop data centers decked out with power sources so they can reduce their reliance on the grid. The duo announced earlier this year that their first project would be a $4 billion data center in Bosque County, Texas, built by CyrusOne and ECP.

Title: Here’s How Much % Of Bitcoin Supply Is Currently Sitting In Losses

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has revealed the number of Bitcoin supply that is currently sitting at a loss. This comes as the BTC price continues to trade below the psychological $90,000 level following its crash, which began last month. In a report, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC, marking the highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle. The analytics platform further noted that this represents 23.7% of the circulating supply, which is currently underwater. 10.2% of this supply is held by long-term holders and 13.5% by short-term holders. Glassnode stated that this distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, the loss-bearing Bitcoin supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term cohort. Meanwhile, the analytics platform noted that the 6-7 million range, which has been at a loss since mid-November, mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration came before a shift toward more bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower Bitcoin prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price has dropped to levels last seen in 2024, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Glassnode stated that this has left behind a dense supply cluster accumulated by top buyers in the $93,000 to $120,000 range. The resulting supply distribution is said to reflect a top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by heavy overhead sell pressure, especially in the early stages of a bearish phase. Glassnode declared that as long as the Bitcoin price remains below this range and fails to reclaim key thresholds, most notably the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101,500, the risk of further corrective downside persists. Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market flows continue to reflect an uneven demand profile across major venues. The Cumulative Volume Delta bias is said to show periodic bursts of buy-side activity, but has failed to develop into sustained accumulation, especially during the recent BTC price pullbacks. The on-chain analytics platform noted that the Coinbase spot CVD remains relatively constructive, indicating steadier participation from US-based investors. On the other hand, Binance and aggregate Bitcoin flows remain choppy and largely directionless. Glassnode stated that these dispersion points point to selective engagement rather than coordinated spot demand. Meanwhile, the platform alluded to recent Bitcoin price declines, which it pointed out have not triggered decisive expansion in positive CVD. Glassnode noted that this suggests dip-buying remains tactical and short-term. In the absence of sustained accumulation across all venues, Bitcoin’s price action continues to rely more on activity in the derivatives market and liquidity conditions rather than organic spot demand. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Share this article Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, is set to be interviewed for the role of Federal Reserve chair at Mar-a-Lago in the final week of the year, CNBC reported Friday. Rieder has spent more than a decade at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Like CEO Larry Fink, he has shifted from early skepticism about crypto to a more pragmatic stance, increasingly framing digital assets as part of a modern portfolio. In public remarks, Rieder has said investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin, describing it as a potential store of value alongside assets such as gold. The Fed chair is one of the most influential positions in global finance, responsible for setting US monetary policy and regulating the nation’s banking system. While Jerome Powell’s term as chair officially ends in mid-May 2026, the succession process is already underway. Trump is currently interviewing finalists, including Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and Rieder. The president expects to announce his nominee in late 2025 or early 2026.

Title: The Asset Layer of the Web: Tokenization Is Becoming Finance’s New Backend Infrastructure
URL: https://hackread.com/asset-layer-web-tokenization-backend-infrastructure/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T11:42:26Z
Full Content:
Retail trading and price swings have defined the public view of cryptocurrency for nearly ten years. Yet, as news outlets tracked market cycles, a structural overhaul took hold in the background that went largely unnoticed. The industry has quietly transitioned from a speculative ecosystem into the infrastructure layer modernizing global finance. This new backend, often described as the “asset layer of the web,” is upgrading the financial system by moving value from slow, siloed legacy databases to instant programmable blockchains. Market data confirms this shift is operating at scale. By December 9, 2025, the total value of stablecoins had climbed nearly 50% for the year to reach a capitalization of $312.55 billion. This surge indicates that digital value transfer is no longer experimental; it is the preferred rail for a significant portion of global liquidity. This institutional maturity was the central theme at Binance Blockchain Week 2025. Industry leaders convened not to discuss token prices, but to analyze how blockchain is functioning as a settlement engine for the real economy. During the Digital Money at Scale panel, Reeve Collins, Co-founder and Chairman of STBL, captured the essence of this utility-driven shift. “Stablecoins are simply a better way to move money globally, instantly, and for free,” Collins noted. His observation highlights the core utility driving adoption: efficiency. While price action draws attention, the true revolution lies in the friction reduction for moving capital across borders. Institutions are moving on-chain to solve specific operational inefficiencies inherent in legacy systems like SWIFT or the DTCC. Traditional finance often relies on a T+2 settlement cycle, where funds and assets take days to clear. The Asset Layer offers a solution through tokenization, converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This allows for instant settlement, 24/7 liquidity, and programmable ownership logic. This demand for efficiency has triggered an explosion in real-world assets. The market cap for tokenized RWAs has reached $18.25 billion, representing a massive, nearly 230% growth. Furthermore, the number of investors utilizing these instruments has widened, with 564,846 holders now owning tokenized assets ranging from private credit to treasury bills. Institutional portfolios are reflecting this change. A recent State Street study indicates that while institutions currently hold approximately 7% of their portfolios in digital assets, this figure is projected to rise to 16% within three years. Asset managers are moving faster than asset owners, recognizing that tokenization is arguably the most significant evolution in market infrastructure since the introduction of electronic messaging in the 1970s, a sentiment echoed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Critically, this infrastructure is already handling volumes that rival traditional clearing houses. During the Binance Blockchain Week panel, Zach Witkoff, Co-Founder and CEO of World Liberty Financial, highlighted a specific use case involving the client that proves the technology’s readiness for high-stakes finance. “USD1 was used to settle the largest transaction in crypto history, MGX investing in Binance,” Witkoff stated. “Five years ago, no one would’ve imagined a $2 billion deal settling in stablecoins.” This transaction serves as a proof point that blockchain rails are now capable of settling billion-dollar institutional deals with speed and finality that legacy banking rails struggle to match. For years, the technology to modernize finance existed, but the requisite trust did not. Major payment networks and banking giants hesitated to fully commit to blockchain rails due to regulatory ambiguity. That hesitation is now dissipating as major jurisdictions implement comprehensive legal frameworks. The regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically with the passage of legislation such as the US GENIUS Act and the implementation of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. These frameworks provide the legal certainty institutions require to treat tokenized assets as legitimate financial instruments rather than gray-market experiments. This clarity allows legacy players like Visa and Amex, which previously faced crippling diligence hurdles, to integrate stablecoins and tokenized assets into their product suites. Reeve Collins addressed this evolution directly during the panel, arguing that the barrier to entry was never technological. “The only real difference between 2018 and now is the regulatory landscape,” Collins explained. “That’s what held tokenization back, not the technology.” With rules of the road now established, corporate balance sheets are increasingly comfortable with digital asset exposure. While risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities and liquidity fragmentation remain, regulated structures compliant with MiCA are mitigating these concerns, effectively granting permission for the world’s wealth to migrate on-chain. The rise of tokenization signals the end of the separation between crypto markets and traditional markets. In the near future, there will likely be only markets, all running on a unified blockchain backend that offers superior transparency and efficiency. Just as the internet protocol TCP/IP runs invisibly beneath the web, tokenization is becoming the invisible standard for value transfer. The focus will shift away from the underlying technology to the products it enables, such as instant cross-border payments, yield-bearing stablecoins, and globally accessible capital markets. The infrastructure is built, the regulations are in place, and the asset layer of the web is now open for business. (Photo by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash) Your email address will not be published.

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The true cost of fulfilling Trump’s mass deportation agenda and who’s profiting. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s first year back in office has been the brutality of his deportation machine and his administration’s numerous attempts to upend due process. Back in March, the Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador. Ábrego Garcia’s legal status protected him from deportation to his home country for fear of persecution. “I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process,” says Ábrego Garcia’s attorney Benjamin Osorio. “There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that.” This week on The Intercept Briefing, host Akela Lacy speaks to Osorio about Ábrego Garcia’s case. After months of being shipped around detention centers, he is free and fighting deportation orders from home with his family. “I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life.” says Osorio. “In the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice.” Ábrego Garcia’s story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda and for that reason his story has become a political flashpoint. But what’s less understood is the scale and scope of fulfilling the administration’s vision of mass deportation. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research called “Deportation, Inc.: The Rise of the Immigration Enforcement Economy,” maps out a vast web of companies that make up the rapidly growing deportation economy, how we got here, and the multibillion-dollar industry driven by profit, political power, and a perverse incentive structure. “The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern,” says Tyler McBrien, managing editor of Lawfare. “And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in.” Gauri Bahuguna, deputy director of research at SITU, adds, “It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is ‘How much money can you make per detained individual?’” “Even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group,” says Bahuguna. “There is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale.” McBride underscores that the current immigration system is “treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing, I’m Akela Lacy. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s second term so far has been the brutality of his deportation machine, from masked agents tackling people in the streets to shipping people off to prisons in far-flung countries. The Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador back in March. But last week, a judge’s order finally freed him. Kilmar Ábrego Garcia: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: I stand here today with my head held up high. AL: That’s Ábrego Garcia speaking at a press conference after his release, joined by advocates and an interpreter at his side. KG: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe this injustice will come to its end. AL: Ábrego Garcia is now back in Maryland with his family and is continuing to fight deportation orders. His story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda. Joining me now to update us on Ábrego Garcia’s case is one of his lawyers, Benjamin Osorio. Benjamin, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Benjamin Osorio: Thank you. AL: Kilmar Ábrego Garcia was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — custody last Thursday. To start, can you tell us how he’s doing since his release? Benjamin Osorio: He’s pretty tired. I don’t know if you saw when he went to go check in with ICE that morning, it looked like he hadn’t slept. I think he’s exhausted from the whole process. He’s bounced around from being deported in March to detained at CECOT — obviously, he’s much happier to be out of CECOT and back in the United States. But then, re-detained again, briefly out for a weekend, back in ICE detention, and then now out. He’s ecstatic to be with his family, but at the same time, I mean, he’s still limited in what he can do and obviously still facing federal charges. AL: During the press conference when he spoke after his release, during the segment where an advocate and a pastor are speaking, you can see him visibly getting emotional. It seemed like he was tearing up. Has this episode changed him? Benjamin Osorio: I didn’t know him before, so it’s hard to say whether it’s changed him, but again, somebody having been through what he has been through, I don’t know how it could not. At this point, if I was him, I would just want resolution to everything and not be in detention. AL: Back in March, Ábrego Garcia was detained by ICE in Baltimore, as you’ve mentioned, and then within a few days he was sent to CECOT, the notorious prison in El Salvador. What can you tell us about his experience in CECOT? Benjamin Osorio: Well, it’s been reported, so this isn’t anything confidential or of that nature. But he was taken off the plane and beaten — that’s sort of their welcome greeting — was beaten as he was taken off the plane. And then their heads were shaved. They were basically beaten on a daily basis, from what it sounds like. They were put on their knees for long periods of time, and if you passed out, you were beaten. They were not allowed to go to the bathroom — many of them urinating on themselves, defecating on themselves. He would talk about, in the middle of the night, you would hear people screaming out for help and nobody doing anything. The lights on 24/7 — blinding lights. Sleeping on all metal beds: no sheets, no pillows, no nothing like that. So it doesn’t sound like a pleasant experience. AL: How did that compare to his experience at the ICE detention facilities that he was shuffled around to? BO: He’s been segregated from everybody else, so not the same group housing that you would typically find in ICE. But being in solitary and only interacting with other individuals for certain hours of the day also has a detrimental effect on your morale and psyche. AL: Of course, yeah. BO: ICE conditions aren’t good, but again, better than CECOT. AL: Can you remind us, for people who might not know the full story, from the beginning of this ordeal, what happened to him? What was the process? Why was he moved to these different centers, and what happened there? BO: Since he’s been back in the United States, he was paroled back in when he was brought back in. He’s been shuffled back and forth between both immigration and criminal custody. So that’s been one of the reasons that he’s been moved back and forth. He was taken out to Tennessee, staying in a Putnam County Jail there, while they were arraigning him on the federal charges and then figuring out whether he was going to be released on bond. Once he was released on bond, he was then re-detained by Baltimore [Enforcement and Removal Operations] and then taken down to Farmville [in Virginia]. The judge in the federal district court case had ordered him to be kept within 200 miles, and then they transferred him from Farmville to Moshannon detention center [in Pennsyvlania]. And that’s where he was released from recently. AL: Can you talk a little bit about the legal strategy of these dueling, federal attacks against him — both on the immigration front and the criminal front — and how that complicated his situation? Benjamin Osorio: I guess, let’s talk about the three-front war, right? So he’s got an immigration case, which is pending before the immigration court. He then also has the habeas case, which — even though he’s out now — continues because of some of the things that have happened in the immigration case that’s taking place in the federal district court in Maryland. And then he’s got the criminal case taking place in federal district court in Tennessee. So he’s got a criminal defense team working on the criminal case. He also has us, who are partnered with Quinn Emanuel working on the district court litigation. And then he has us just working on the immigration court litigation. “Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now.” So it’s kind of messy, but what he was granted before is called withholding of removal. Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now. So if you won withholding of removal, they can’t remove you to your home country, but they can remove you to a third country. So let’s say that he has this protection from El Salvador, they were not supposed to have been able to send him to El Salvador, but they could send him to Mexico, to Honduras, to Guatemala as part of these third-country agreements. They could do that. He would be a very visible candidate for them to try to go after to do that. We feel that we also were fighting the immigration case to try to normalize his status, get that back reopened, and adjust his status. Now when they paroled him back into the United States, they also created some new immigration options for him as well, potentially applying for asylum because he’s back within one year of having entered the United States, but also he’s married to a U.S. citizen. So now that he has a lawful entry back into the United States, he could potentially adjust status through her. So it’s messy. And obviously, the government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him. “The government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him.” AL: You mentioned like his particular circumstances made him the perfect target for this administration and what they’re trying to do. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that and how his case became a flashpoint in this administration’s immigration policies. This was the case that finally pushed Democratic senators to say, “We’re going to go and visit these detainees,” people who have been removed. Why did that happen? BO: I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process, right? There’s a reason that if somebody that we all know goes and commits a murder, they still get a trial. We don’t summarily execute them unless they’re a danger to the police officers arresting them or anything else like that. There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that. And so the Constitution is designed to protect us from the government. And so here is the government violating somebody’s due process, violating the Constitution. And I think that’s why people cared about it. I don’t think it was necessarily about Kilmar, or his specific person — or it’s not about whether Kilmar is a good guy or a bad guy. It’s about, the government owes a responsibility to do the right thing, AL: The order to release Kilmar — a federal U.S. district judge in Maryland said that federal authorities lacked a legal basis for continuing to detain him. Has his case changed anything in your view, as far as how judges are handling other similar cases, or how the administration is approaching targeting people like Kilmar? BO: Yes. The federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed. But there’s been a change in bond rules too. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with this. In September, there was a case that came out from the Board of Immigration Appeals called Matter of Yajure Hurtado, and it basically tries to change the rules to make so many people ineligible for bond. Because they were trying to change the rules without actually going through Congress to change the law — which actually governs statutes and mandatory detention and who’s eligible for bond — we started filing a ton of habeases. And so I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life. “ I think the federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed.” Like I said, they’re probably sick of it, but at the same time, they’ve been great and fast-acting on these habeas. Sometimes a habeas, a normal habeas, could pin for a while. But they’ve been great on ordering either the immigration courts to hold a bond hearing and find a head jurisdiction or beyond that ordering these people released. So in the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice. AL: What’s next for Ábrego Garcia after his release? Obviously, you mentioned his pending cases. BO: It’s hard to say. We’re still in the middle of briefing both before the immigration side of things, both at the immigration court level because the immigration judge just issued a new order the other day, and then also before the Board of Immigration Appeals. And then because of some of the acts that the board and the IJ have taken — the immigration judge — have taken, now Judge [Paula] Xinis has ordered an additional briefing on the [Temporary Restraining Order] right now in federal district court. Look, I was shocked. People were asking us when we first started if we were going to be able to bring him back. And then I was kind of shocked that Xinis found that he didn’t have a removal order. It’s not something I would’ve predicted in the beginning. But then when there was that hearing a couple weeks ago, and she was talking about there not being a valid order because he was ordered removed to Guatemala. I mean there’s been a lot of different turns here. I think it’s hard to predict what ultimately happens. Like I said, if I’m him, I just want to be out and I want to be with my family, and if that means it’s in Costa Rica or whether that’s here in the United States as long as I’m not detained, I would be happy. AL: Any final thoughts? One thing I would ask maybe if you want to elaborate on is this idea that it doesn’t really matter what kind of person it is when we’re talking about these cases. Like, what matters is the statute and the constitutional protections that are here. And that’s completely at odds with how the administration has framed all of this — that the people it’s going after are criminals who deserve whatever’s coming to them. I think that’s an important distinction, but if there’s any other point that you touched on that you want to elaborate on? BO: I just think it’s funny. I hear different officials go on TV and they say, we’re going after the individuals who are breaking the law, or we’re going after the individuals here who are here unlawfully. But there have been many cases where they are making the people unlawful. So when they take away Temporary Protected Status from people from Haiti and Sudan and from Venezuela, these countries that have ongoing crisis in them, they made them undocumented. And when they say that we want people to do things the right way — look, Congress passed Section 208 [of the Immigration and Nationality Act] and made asylum a lawful pathway. Asylum is a lawful pathway to get status here in the United States. Now, if Congress wants to change the laws, that would be well within their right to do. But until they do that, their attempts to block asylum-seekers and their attempts through different regulatory changes or through the Board of Immigration appeals to whittle away asylum and go after victims of domestic violence — I don’t know, to me, that’s not the American way, and it’s sad that our government is targeting some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society. AL: What else is on your docket right now? BO: It’s pretty crazy, the number of detentions has obviously picked up pretty significantly, and that’s sort of my specialty, is detained removal. “Our immigration system is broken.” It’s just very sad because I see so many families — and families of people with U.S. citizen spouses and families of people with U.S. citizen kids — getting ripped apart. People always ask me, they say, “Why don’t people just do it the right way?” I have friends who are not immigration lawyers or, I’m from Georgia, I have a lot of friends who have maybe very different views on immigration than I have, and they’re like, “They’ve been here for 20 years. Why haven’t they fixed their status?” And I’m like, “Our immigration system is broken. I don’t think you understand like how complicated it is for somebody who’s been here 20 years.” Even if they have a U.S. citizen spouse, if they have more than two entries, they might be subject to a 212(a)(9)(C) and be subject to the “permanent bar.” That means they have to stay outside for 10 years — away from their U.S. citizen spouse, away from their U.S. citizen kids. “People don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans.” And then I have other things, where people are active members of this community. I have a family I represent that the U.S. citizen spouse works for a local school board, and they have two small U.S. citizen kids. And it’s sort of complicated, but at one hearing where the judge was ordering him removed, even though we won later on appeal and he’s still here — a 7-year-old girl’s coming up to me. And I have 6-year-old twins. So she’s about my kids’ age, and she’s asking me, “When is Dad going to come home?” And I’m like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” And so I just think people don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the economy. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the American brand here. AL: Thank you so much for taking the time, Ben. We know you have a lot on your plate, so we really appreciate it. BO: Thank you. AL: After a quick break, we’re going to zoom out and talk about exactly who is profiting from the Trump’s deportation agenda, and take a closer look at what has become a rapidly expanding and lucrative industry. We’ll be right back. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Break AL: Welcome back to The Intercept Briefing. The militarization of U.S. borders and immigration policy is a project that’s been long in the making. Bill Clinton: We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law. George W. Bush: We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re going to make this country safer for all our citizens. Barack Obama: Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws. Unknown: President Obama has deported more undocumented workers than President Bush did. Donald Trump: And we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. AL: The violent immigration raids we see in communities across the country today could not have happened without the bipartisan efforts of past presidents — those who paved the way for an insatiable immigration bureaucracy and an unhinged administration ready to take it over. As of November, ICE is detaining more than 65,000 people, a historic high, according to The Guardian. Under the guise of protecting national security, officials have transformed U.S. immigration over the last two decades into a cash cow for private corporations. Today, Trump’s deportation machine takes up more than half of all federal law enforcement spending. And Trump’s marquee spending bill raises that to 80 percent. Democratic senators just released a report that found that the Trump administration diverted $2 billion in Pentagon funds to target immigrants, as our colleagues Nick Turse and Noah Hurowitz reported earlier this month. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research maps out this vast web that comprises the deportation economy: how U.S. immigration enforcement has evolved into a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry shaped by private profit, political power and a perverse incentive structure. Joining me now to talk about this industry are some of the folks behind the project. Tyler McBrien is the managing editor of Lawfare, a nonprofit publication covering law, national security, and foreign policy. Tyler McBrien: Thanks for having me, Akela. AL: And we’re joined by Gauri Bahuguna, a computational designer and deputy director of research at SITU Research, a visual investigations practice in Brooklyn, New York. We’ve worked with SITU on reporting on reconstructions of police responses to protests, it’s great to have you on. Welcome, Gauri. Gauri Bahuguna: Thank you for having me. AL: To start, for both of you, what drove you all to do this project? What did you feel was missing from the public’s understanding of how the system works? GB: This project actually began as far back as 2023, and at the time we were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border. So at the time we were looking at the various, the physical, the digital, and the political infrastructures that create this everywhere border, so to speak. And from there, obviously, the election last year was a huge point for us to track and study. The industry part came up in our research of how and why this immigration enforcement seems to be a growing hot- button issue. “We were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border.” TM: What we are trying to do with this project is to make visible an entire system, as much as that’s possible. All the facets of the immigration enforcement economy — be it detention, deportation, surveillance, and interdiction — because I’m sure listeners can relate, the past year has just been this feeling of jumping from fire to fire. And you can easily miss the forest for the trees. We wanted to highlight not just these big-name companies that people will be familiar with — the Palantirs, the Googles, even maybe the GEO Groups, the private prisons — but also smaller companies that do food service or IT services that make up these web of contracts for ICE and DHS. AL: Tyler, that’s a good segue because we know that this is obviously a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s agenda, but there’s been a bipartisan effort to build up this machine since long before he first took office, which really accelerated when George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security and ICE after 9/11. But what other figures helped drive that expansion prior to Trump? How did we get to where we are today? TM: The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern. And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in because of this “higher echelon” issue of national security versus civil enforcement. 2002 was a pivotal moment, but like we said, it was building before that. We really try to convey that in the videos — of having not only Trump on the campaign trail promising the biggest deportation campaign in history, but also dating back to Bush, of course to Bill Clinton, and before. Just to also back up, the framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex, and throw out this provocation that we may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics. “The framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex. … We may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics.” AL: Gauri, can you talk about the main ways that this deportation economy operates? GB: It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is “How much money can you make per detained individual?” And for now, even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group, where there is a minimum quota that ICE must fulfill in order to be in contract with these companies. And any detainees above that minimum guaranteed daily population, they get discounts on. So there is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale. TM: This is another, I think, motivation behind the project is to highlight not only the ideological and political motives of the current immigration system — think Stephen Miller’s vision — but also the profit motive driving this perpetual system. And the upshot of it is something that Gauri just touched on, which is treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit there. AL: Can you talk more about this incentive structure and who is profiting? Like you mentioned, everyone knows Palantir, GEO Group, CoreCivic, and you mentioned there’s some other names that people may not be as familiar with playing a significant role there. But yeah, I’m curious to hear more about who is actually profiting. GB: The main profiteers are those large private prison corporations like CoreCivic and GEO Group, because ICE has different kinds of facilities that range from completely owned and operated by ICE to agreements with the marshals, and then completely contracted detention facility centers. And because of the pricing structure offered by these private companies, it is the lowest price per night per detainee in private detention centers. However, ICE will often work with local and state governments, who then subcontract out to these private companies to detain populations. So what happens is that almost or close to 90 percent of all of the detainee population are held in private prisons because it just makes that much more economic sense. TM: As Gauri said the biggest ones are the private prison contractors. I think the biggest single contractor is GEO Group, which listeners will probably be familiar, but they’re also smaller firms. In surveillance, we have the big names like Google, Palantir, Clearview, but there are also smaller companies, like BI2 Technologies. There are investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard. In the video, we have this map that shows just this web of companies. But I think what was really interesting in doing this project was to come to realize that this analogy between the military–industrial complex and the immigration–industrial complex was sometimes not so much an analogy as just the extension of one into the other. So some of these firms are the same. You have Northrop Grumman, where you have big weapons manufacturers. You have gun manufacturers that are also benefiting. AL: Because they’re arming the guards? TM: Exactly. And arming for some of the immigration raids, so for example, Operation Midway Blitz. AL: Does the incentive structure that you were talking about, Gauri, does that have the potential to limit future avenues for policy change on immigration? And is that already happening? Like the idea that the incentives are built around the fact that this economy already exists and it needs to continue existing or else it’ll be bad for the economy, and does that make it harder to unwind this machine? GB: That’s an interesting question. I think because these are being detailed in the contracts themselves, I would imagine, it is something that could be addressed and there could be safeguards against having these types of quotas. Because again, it is just another expression of the detention bed quota, and they did successfully get that repealed. AL: But the idea that like, even though they repealed that, it’s still part of this structure. Like, the economy is operating with a mind of its own, like outside of the policy sphere. TM: I think that’s the dynamic that we’re warning that is already happening and will continue to happen and further entrench. So if you think about detention, for example, which is the first chapter of the video that we put out. Often companies like GEO Group will have idle facilities that were just a red line on their balance sheet. And now there’s this huge incentive to get these idle facilities up and running — fill the beds. And then the way that it can become entrenched in that community, for example, is then that creates some jobs. And it’s this perverse choice between an economic boon to the local community in some small way versus not having those jobs. And so, you can see how these incentives — these just pure economic incentives — can just keep driving the machine as you said. AL: This is obviously very linked to the broader phenomenon of mass incarceration in the U.S. and the push and pull over cutting the number of people that we have behind bars outside of the immigration system. Did that come up at all in this project? Are there characters or actors who play a major role in building up the carceral system who also play a role in this system? We know private prisons, GEO Group and CoreCivic, are a big part of this, but obviously they don’t incarcerate the majority of people in the U.S. But I’m curious how this came up, if at all, during your research and how you think about the nexus between the U.S. prison system and immigration detention. GB: Yeah, absolutely. They’re so closely tied together because GEO Group, their facilities are both, again, they’re private prisons and also immigrant detention facilities. I believe some of the private prisons were then converted into detention centers. And now because there is this tipping point where there’s just so much more money in this immigration enforcement, you see other actors [are] moving toward that. “The myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research.” I also just wanted to note that the myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research. And one of our colleagues actually took a road trip through America and visited a lot of these towns that were in close proximity to these facilities. And because of the stop-and-start nature, so sometimes they would be filled, so the detention center was operational, so there were a few jobs given out. Then it would shut down, so they would all lose their jobs immediately. And more recently, with the immigration detention facilities, because of language requirements, they were not even hiring people from the neighboring towns. So it’s not even that there was a direct benefit to the community. AL: That’s really interesting. Did they interview people who lived in the town or where, who were they talking to? GB: Yes, pretty much people in the local watering hole. This is the facility that is also mentioned in the video in Michigan, one of the GEO Group idle facilities that was just recently opened, and I believe it’s the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest. So he was speaking to a lot of people in small towns around that detention center, and they all expressed similar sentiment. AL: I also just want to touch on this idea that ICE and CBP have really exponentially increased the amount of power and influence that they have over not just immigration policy, but our government in general. “ Two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point.” There’s been so much great reporting on just how much money has been diverted from other parts of the government, or how many agents have been diverted to these agencies to sort of power this machine. But I wonder, can you talk about that phenomenon? Like, these two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point. TM: Yeah, I guess I don’t want to overstate something that I said earlier about the profit motive and the economic factors driving all of this/ That’s a fear, and something that we’ve been seeing that is driving policy. But of course the political and the ideological motives are also driving this. You see this in the national security strategy that was just released by the administration — that border security and controlling immigration is the national security threat. So you see it elevated in the political arena as well. And then it’s not just the administration. You have Congress to thank for the exponentially higher billions that are flooding into DHS and ICE, who can then award the contracts to these companies. GB: It’s the result of decadeslong lobbying campaigns, right, to push for these harsh immigration laws. So I think there’s definitely the political angle, and also because of how CBP and ICE are allowed to operate, which is slightly different from other law enforcement agencies; they have a lot more leeway. Border Patrol, for example, they have a 100-mile radius within the U.S. border, that they can stop people without a warrant and just question them. I think these types of extra powers make it easier for the conversion or the misappropriation of a military force, so to speak. TM: And just to add one point to what Gauri said about lobbying. If you take GEO Group, for example, their PAC, according to FEC filings, was the first to max out donations to Trump’s 2024 campaign. AL: On this point about this being part of the national security strategy and this lobbying apparatus, this is also a strategy that Trump and his allies want to push beyond the U.S. and into Europe, for example. Can you talk a little bit about that, how the Trump administration is essentially lobbying to export this around the world, export this system around the world? TM: Yeah. I can speak to one aspect of this. Take the video that we put out on detention. We broke it down into three ways in which the detention economy works. One is permanent facilities. We talked a lot about private prisons. One is temporary or soft-sided facilities. But the third that we cover — as a sort of form of outsourcing or contracting — is “alternative jurisdictions,” as we call it. So think El Salvador, CECOT. Think the talk about detaining migrants at Guantánamo Bay. And then of course the system of deportation, these third-country removals, these are transactional often in nature, in terms of what a country would economically benefit very often from receiving migrants from the United States. We wanted to expand the idea of what a contract could be or what this transaction could look like beyond just the U.S. government and a private company in the US. It’s really more expansive than that. AL: Can you talk about how you compiled this project? I know a lot of the information was public or open source, but tell me about your approach. Where did you start? GB: So the first step was to identify who are the main actors within this economy. And that was identified through looking at the budgets and the contracts that you mentioned. This is open-source information. And then after that, we really wanted to understand further how this is exploding as a way. So I think looking for the details within the contracts that really jumped out, like the tiered pricing, for example. And then moving into now, how do you put this all together and visualize it? And I think that’s where we started being a bit more experimental with our research. And so one example is the parametric tool that we use to visualize deployed resources, which is one of the soft-sided detention facility contractors. So just trying to visualize what detention at this scale means because I don’t think that’s something that is particularly present in most of the conversations. So it was a combination of trying to find and really parse through these government contracts and all of this jargon. And then translate it into a way that was, again, paints this picture of it being beyond the border and located to other geographies within the United States. TM: On this parametric tool. I think Gauri and some of her colleagues at SITU really helped understand projections and what these big numbers and big promises would actually mean. “What do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean?” What that gets at is just the reason for contracting in the first place. The government just doesn’t have the capacity to find, detain, and deport the numbers of people that they are setting as a goal. And sometimes not even the single facility or single company that are contracted to do something can do it, which means that there likely will be more contracts and more money going into it. So I think that’s one thing that the SITU team really helped me visualize at least, was, what do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean? AL: Tyler you brought up Stephen Miller earlier. Obviously we’re going to have to talk about him at some point. Top White House adviser Stephen Miller is widely recognized as the brains behind Trump’s deportation agenda. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent had this great piece about his vision earlier this week. He wrote, “Miller’s grander aims are best understood as an effort to destroy the entire architecture of immigration and humanitarian resettlement put in place in the post-World War II era.” I really encourage people to go read this because they interview Miller’s family members and go into like this book that his family member wrote about the immigration apparatus, like when they came to the U.S. Anyway, very interesting. But can you guys talk about Miller, his vision, and how that’s coming to life under Trump’s second term — and how that deviates or doesn’t deviate from lthe post-9/11 vision of this system? TM: I haven’t read the piece, and I can’t believe you’re asking me to crawl into Stephen Miller’s mind. [laughs] AL: Sorry, someone has to. [laughs] TM: I would go back to what I was saying in the past answer, where the way to achieve the scale at which Stephen Miller wants to deport and relocate people again is only achieved through a massive expansion of contracts. And that’s why the funding bill was so material to this. AL: You’re talking about the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” TM: Exactly, yeah. So I think Stephen Miller and even the Trump administration as a whole can announce that they want to hit these benchmarks, but it’s then these contractors who come in. GB: Yeah, I agree with what you said but also wanted to acknowledge the very prominent white nationalist undercurrent of his vision. AL: Yeah. GB: And I think that we can see that play out in how the language of how to describe migrants is very dehumanizing, “illegal aliens.” And it’s just rife with xenophobia in every news coverage. And I think that is moving the country toward a more, or less tolerant overall perspective of what migrants are and specifically which migrants are “good” and worthy of being in this country. And I think that is probably the most scary part of his vision coming to life. TM: Yeah, it’s a great point. We were constantly asking ourselves what part of this system we have today is continuity and what part is rupture. And I think to Gauri’s point, I mean that the rupture is just the destruction of any sort of refugee program, save for white Afrikaners from South Africa, is just a nakedly, racist policy. I think there’s just no other interpretation. AL: You’ve both mentioned this capacity issue — Miller and Trump have these quotas that incentivize these policies, but maybe don’t have the capacity to fulfill that vision, even though they’ve been very successful at it so far. But this brings up this notion that I heard a lot prior to Trump’s election. Policy people and reporters who cover immigration were saying, “Not that this is overblown, but take it with a grain of salt because there is no capacity to do what they’re saying that they want to do.” We’re obviously seeing that not really be borne out right now. But even if there isn’t capacity to achieve their goals, does it matter because of how much they’ve already been able to do? Obviously by diverting money, resources, and agents from all of these other departments, but despite all the handwringing over capacity, like this is still obviously happening in full force. GB: I don’t think it matters that much both for the base that they’re trying to appeal to and also the corporations and individuals involved in this large scale operation. What happens is that yes, it’s completely impossible for them to meet the targets they’re setting for themselves, but in doing so, they create like an urgency and that’s when more of these regulations start to dip and drop. [White House border czar] Tom Homan, for example, has already been calling to reduce the detention standards in ICE facilities, if it’s not permanent facilities, and we go into the tents. And then within the tents again, how much more can you pack in so you squeeze more profit, reduce the living conditions of these places, and then you have a lot more to show for that’s closer to this target, but whether or not they ever reach, it doesn’t matter to the people affected. AL: Right. I want to mention another piece that was recently published. Above the Law published this story about ICE, perhaps, inadvertently, posting a “watchlist” of immigration lawyers. We know the administration routinely attacks its perceived enemies, including immigration attorneys. What do you make of that and how the administration has gone after the legal system to power its agenda? TM: Yeah, I think it’s a clear attempt to reduce the friction that they face in the immigration system. And often that friction is happening in the courts. Some of the biggest administration immigration stories of the year have been about these high profile deportation cases. Kilmar Ábrego García, for example, Mahmoud Khalil, of course. You’re seeing the strategy deployed across other issue areas too. It’s the flip side of the capacity — they’re building out capacity while also trying to reduce the barriers, and most of the barriers are legal ones. AL: Right. GB: Even just in the geographic distribution, it’s again, trying to set up these obstacles for accessing legal counsel. So that’s very intentional, right? They’re extremely rural areas where most of these facilities are. It’s very difficult for people to be in touch with lawyers in facilities like Alligator Alcatraz; there was no access at all. So I think there is this both contempt and disregard for the law, but also intentional fear of limiting access. AL: Given where we are today and how big this deportation economy has grown and how deeply it’s spread its tentacles into all of these other sectors that we’ve touched on, is it possible to unwind this and what would that take? TM: It’s such a hard question. Like I said earlier, we throw out the analogy to Eisenhower’s military–industrial complex farewell speech. I think it’s safe to say that his warning went unheeded, and the military–industrial complex only increased exponentially. Which is one of the reasons we wanted to shift this new warning that, you know, maybe it will be heeded this time. But it is worrying to me because I think you contrast the current moment to the first administration, first Trump administration, where there were sometimes successful worker-organized protests, for example, especially at tech companies. After contracts with ICE were made public, workers came together to protest and sometimes those contracts were canceled. I feel like you’re not seeing the same dynamic here. There is, I guess, some power in the consumer base and if consumers are made aware of companies or investments that they are a part of that are also being used to detain and deport people often illegally, then perhaps there’s some sort of pressure point there. AL: And this reminds me, we didn’t even talk about this. The first anti-ICE protests that we saw under Trump [this term] brought the first National Guard deployment that we saw. And now I feel like people don’t even really — he’s deployed the National Guard to so many cities that people don’t necessarily connect that to that being an effort to tamp down on opposition to this deportation machine. GB: That actually connects quite well to what I’m about to say, which is I am a little skeptical about whether the toothpaste can be put back into the tube just because of how deep these roots have gotten into every part of our daily lives. And so the first pieces were about detention, and we’re going to do one on deportation and interdiction. Then the final one is a data surveillance piece. And I think that is really, that’s where so much money — like far beyond what the deportation and detention is estimated. I think this data surveillance piece is what will ultimately also impact citizens most directly, right? It’s being tested on migrants and then slowly, as you mentioned with the National Guard, it just creeps into daily life and becomes normalized. So I think just because of the, and we see that the large tech companies are also embedded into this administration, so I just feel like we’re moving towards a very dark point of no return. AL: Thank you for using the toothpaste and the tube analogy, because I think that is a perfect analogy for this. It’s not only impossible to do, but it’s very messy. Thank you both for joining me on the Intercept Briefing. This has been a great conversation on a depressing topic, so we really appreciate it. GB: Thank you. TM: Yeah, thanks so much for having us. AL: We’re going to add a link to the SITU and Lawfare series in our show notes and on our website. Really encourage you all to check it out.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. IT’S BEEN A DEVASTATING year for journalism — the worst in modern U.S. history. We have a president with utter contempt for truth aggressively using the government’s full powers to dismantle the free press. Corporate news outlets have cowered, becoming accessories in Trump’s project to create a post-truth America. Right-wing billionaires have pounced, buying up media organizations and rebuilding the information environment to their liking. In this most perilous moment for democracy, The Intercept is fighting back. But to do so effectively, we need to grow. That’s where you come in.

Title: Brad Lander on What It Takes to Win as a Progressive

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The outgoing New York City comptroller discusses governing on the left, his run for Congress, and why housing and affordability should define the next Democratic fight. Brad Lander, the outgoing New York City comptroller, is running for Congress against Representative Dan Goldman in New York’s 10th District. Brad Lander is leaving his post as New York City comptroller and running for Congress in New York’s 10th District, which includes parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. A longtime progressive, Lander recently mounted a mayoral bid that finished third in the Democratic primary—but under ranked-choice voting, his cross-endorsement and campaigning alongside Zohran Mamdani helped consolidate progressive support and proved pivotal to Mamdani’s victory. In conversation with Nation president Bhaskar Sunkara, Lander reflects on that race, his years as the city’s chief fiscal watchdog, and the relationship between movement pressure and governing power. —Bhaskar Sunkara Bhaskar Sunkara: You spent over a decade in the City Council. When you look back now, what do you see as the through line of your work during that period that most shaped how you view politics? Brad Lander: You can fight harder, win more, and build a broader coalition when you approach politics as a team sport. When I joined the City Council, we teamed up with the Working Families Party and other allies to create the Progressive Caucus—to bring in the workers, tenants, and community leaders that did not previously have a home in the Council to partner in campaigns for dignity for all New Yorkers. And we did well. We banned stop-and-frisk and strengthened protections for tenants against eviction. We became the first city in the country to guarantee a living wage for Uber drivers and deliveristas, stable schedules for fast food and retail workers, and strong protections for freelancers from wage theft. We desegregated the middle schools of Brooklyn’s District 15 and brought participatory budgeting to New York City. All of those campaigns were won by “inside/outside” coalitions. They won meaningful material gains, so they built trust and strength for the next fight, and for more genuinely participatory democracy. BS: Did your time as comptroller change how you think about budgeting and public management and about the practical limits of what progressive governance can do within those constraints? BL: Serving as comptroller reinforced for me that good progressive governance depends on getting the fundamentals right. The constraints—financial, legal, administrative, personnel—also turn out to be the tools. The nuts and bolts of government, constructed through contracts, public finance, and labor agreements are what actually hold up our schools and subways, public hospitals and housing and services. So you have to really understand how they work, in order to put them together in new ways. Take the pension funds: We grew New York City’s funds to over $300 billion, while divesting fossil fuels and pushing our portfolio companies and asset managers hard on decarbonization, saving 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments through an innovative investment to buy the mortgages on them when Signature Bank failed, and helping tens of thousands of workers win union contracts through neutrality agreements that we insisted on as investors. There are, of course, limits to what you can do, but we so rarely test them. BS: We last spoke when you were just launching your mayoral run. Tell me about some of the lessons you drew from that race and if there’s something, at either an ideological or practical level, that’s informing how you’re approaching this congressional campaign? BL: Obviously, the mayoral race didn’t go quite like I planned it! But I feel really proud of the campaign we ran. The cross-endorsement of Zohran not only helped defeat Andrew Cuomo; it also opened up a deep well of solidarity—that politics can be a team sport to win for our values, and also that Muslim and Jewish New Yorkers can organize together. When I was arrested by ICE agents while trying to accompany neighbors seeking asylum, it was as part of a team of organizations bearing witness, in the tradition of nonviolent resistance. So we’ve been back again every week, and the movement to resist ICE and protect neighbors is growing in every corner of the city. Our democracy is precarious because people feel so precarious. They are constantly treading water, see that the system is rigged, and want bigger change. But our system isn’t delivering it. In moments of crisis, voters want leaders who understand the stakes and are willing to fight like our lives on the line. That’s how I’m approaching this campaign. I’ve spent my life organizing my neighbors to win big fights, from stopping evictions, to building new housing, desegregating our schools, and protecting immigrants from ICE. I recognize this moment, and I’m ready to meet it. BS: NY-10 spans working-class communities and very wealthy ones—people who experience the city in fundamentally different ways. What rises to the top for you as the district’s most immediate, everyday challenges? BL: Affordability and housing. It’s just a huge issue for families across the district, whether they’re in Red Hook or in Greenwich Village. These are neighborhoods people truly love, with little leagues and small businesses and schools and religious congregations that people treasure, but they don’t know how their kids will possibly be able to live here. This has been the work of my career. Fighting evictions and building affordable housing at the Fifth Avenue Committee, community planning and organizing for the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, preserving or building over 50,000 affordable homes as comptroller. I’ll bring this expertise to Congress to help cities build housing people can actually afford, protect tenants, end homelessness, and fix public housing. BS: What federal interventions would make the most direct difference for renters and working families here? BL: We need to use every tool in our tool belt—and then construct some new tools as well. That means combining the abundance agenda with a social housing agenda, as my Local Progress colleagues recently argued in The Nation. For example, federal housing, transportation, and infrastructure subsidies should also come along with requirements that municipalities eliminate restrictive and exclusion zoning, and with incentives to experiment with new housing models, so more housing gets built overall, and more inclusively—this is the idea of Senator Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. Congress should repeal the Faircloth Amendment and work with cities and states to set up “public developers” to spark a new generation of experimentation. And the federal government should strengthen tenant protections—as we did creatively with the first-ever Responsible Property Management Standards adopted by a pension fund—because tenants shouldn’t be kicked out of their homes just because rents are rising in their community and because we won’t sustain support for growth if people believe they will be. BS: Dan Goldman votes with the Democratic caucus almost all of the time. What would you put forward that he hasn’t? BL: NY-10 voters want a representative who shares their urgency, and their values. They want a representative who will fight like our lives and our country are on the line, because they are. They don’t want a representative who is vacationing in the Bahamas in the same resort as Donald Trump Jr. during the government shutdown. They don’t want a representative trading stock to the tune of $10 million in industries he’s meant to oversee in Congress. They don’t want a representative who voted to censure Rashida Tlaib, but who views Randy Fine as a partner. They don’t want a representative who keeps voting to send 2,000-pound bombs to Netanyahu to continue the genocide in Gaza. This district needs someone who actually represents them. I am a progressive Democrat, yes, and also a veteran lawmaker. I will organize with this community to protect our neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, and fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I will also use the experience I have from 12 years on the New York City Council and four years as City Comptroller to build coalitions across ideological differences. I know how to get work done and I will be laser focused on delivering for this district. This district is full of people hungry to organize with their congressmember to protect neighbors from ICE and fight fascism, but also to fight for an economy that isn’t rigged against working people. I’ll offer bolder leadership, that’s out on the front lines organizing. As I did in the City Council, I’ll lead on workers’ rights and economic justice issues, including protecting freelancers and gig-workers who lack even basic protections or dignity. BS: What do you see as Congress’s role in pushing for peace and a Palestinian state? BL: For too long, US foreign policy leadership, including among Democrats, has failed to recognize and advance this clear truth: Israelis will only be safe and free when Palestinians are free and safe. Congress has an important oversight responsibility to ensure peace in the region and ensure that Palestinians and Israelis are each guaranteed security and sovereignty. That means Congress should stop supplying Israel with offensive weaponry contributing to the destruction of Gaza—which I recognize as a genocide, following most international human rights organizations, and after reading the works of Rafael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor who developed the term—and insist that Israel follow international law. We should recognize a Palestinian state, while insisting that it too follow international law and reject terrorism. For any of that, we must curb AIPAC’s outsized influence in our politics. More broadly, I’ll fight for a new Democratic foreign policy vision that defends human rights and international norms, emphasizes global peacemaking over militarism, and defeats authoritarianism through multilateral alliances to combat inequality and poverty. New Yorkers’ hard-earned tax dollars should not be going to fund forever wars and human rights violations—whether by foreign leaders or American ones. I will push to rebuild USAID for a new era, to protect civilians from Ukraine to Sudan to Venezuela, and to roll back the imperial presidency, whichever party is in power, and restore Congress’s constitutional role to set foreign policy. BS: What does meaningful resistance to Trump look like? BL: We need a Democratic Party that is not afraid to fight Trump but also is actually committed to creating an economy that does not solely benefit corporate interests. A Democratic Party that is capable of projecting a vision for an economy where working people can thrive, where housing, health care, and childcare aren’t out of reach, and then actually delivering that for people A Democratic Party that can win in a wider range of places, which means trying a wider range of things. We need a Democratic Party that isn’t afraid of innovating, or of holding ourselves and our leadership accountable. We have to seize this moment. Trump is facing record low popularity and Americans are growing impatient with him on affordability. They believe he is going too far on immigration. We already have openings of resistance, and it requires Democrats moving with urgency to escalate the fight, propose new ideas, and be ready to deliver on them. BS: Even with Biden-era policy wins, Democrats still struggle with working-class voters. What do you think the party is getting wrong—and how would you argue for a different direction? BL: When heirs to corporate empires hold office, people rightly feel that the party is out of touch. Working class people have watched wealth continue to flow upward, watched corruption run rampant, watch prices grow faster than wages. Democrats need to call this out plainly and propose real, concrete solutions. I’ve spent decades delivering real economic wins. We won Universal Pre-K and 3K, paid sick leave, living wages and stable schedules for deliveristas, wage theft protections. When people see Democrats deliver on bread-and-butter issues—childcare, healthcare, housing, and better jobs—it rebuilds faith that the party is listening to them. It also matters who the messengers are. We need a Democratic Party full of younger, working-class people who look like and represent their districts. I have worked hard to recruit and support young, diverse, working-class candidates, not only in New York City through WFP and the Progressive Caucus, like my City Council successor Shahana Hanif, but also through the national organization Local Progress that I helped to build along with Ady Barkan. BS: What’s your biggest regret from your council years? BL: While we made some progress in my City Council district by desegregating our middle schools and through the Gowanus Neighborhood Rezoning, where we conducted the first Racial Impact Study for a rezoning, but we fell short on broader policies to combat segregation. Two things I fought for but didn’t win: a bill banning co-op discrimination and a comprehensive planning framework that would further fair housing goals. BS: And what’s biggest regret as comptroller? BL: My last big swing is to get our pension funds to drop BlackRock, our biggest asset manager, because they are misaligned with our decarbonization plan. We’ve already divested fossil fuels and taken on big banks and utilities, but BlackRock has retreated in the face of Trump. So far, I haven’t been able to get a majority of the pension fund trustees to vote with me here. BS: What are you most proud of from your time on the City Council? BL: Desegregating the middle-schools of Community School District 15 in Brooklyn, the Gowanus Rezoning, and first-in-the-nation living wage and labor protection laws for deliveristas, Uber drivers, fast-food workers, and freelancers. BS: And how about as comptroller? BL: The investment that helped save 35,000 rent-stabilized apartments after the Signature Bank collapse. We stepped in to prevent those homes from being snapped up by speculators and preserved them as affordable housing. Every unit is preserved as rent stabilized and delivering strong returns for New York City’s retirees, too. BS: We’re in a moment of revived big ideas—from Trump’s national populism to Zohran’s democratic socialism. What’s your own larger vision for a just United States? What is “Landerism?” BL: Like I said in my campaign launch ad, it’s corny, but it’s a vision where democracy is understood as neighbors working together to make our lives in common better. Where Mr. Rogers takes on ICE, AIPAC, and corporate power to build a neighborhood that everyone can afford and where everyone is welcome. Practically, that means making a sharp critique of inequality, building a broad coalition around basic ideas of empathy, and getting into the weeds to make sure government actually delivers the goods. Over the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress. We publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public. In 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen. Through December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering. With your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now. While your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account. I hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.

Kalyani Ramadurgam, the Indian-origin co-founder of Kobalt Labs, alongside former Affirm software engineer Ashi Agrawal, have made it to the Forbes 30-Under-30 United States List for 2026 in the finance category. Founded in 2023, Kobalt Labs uses machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models to comb through “mountains of documents”. It helps banks vet their business partners, ensure compliance with financial regulations and promptly disclose security breaches, as per Forbes. Kalyani Ramadurgam formerly worked at Apple, where her role involved preventing individuals on terrorism watch lists from using Apple Pay, according to Forbes. Despite Apple's technological prowess, she was “shocked that the compliance process was analog and tedious”, requiring thousands of pages of documentation to be reviewed manually. She told the publication, “It meant reading through not just hundreds, but thousands of pages of documentation. Organisations were just throwing bodies at the problem.” This frustration inspired her to co-found Kobalt in 2023 with Agrawal, aiming to “bring compliance into the machine-learning age”. According to Forbes, Kobalt Labs uses AI to help banks comb through massive amounts of data and documents to review their partners. Its tool ensures compliance with financial laws, including disclosure of security breaches, halting money transfers from sanctioned countries and more. The company has raised $13 million in funding and has over 20 customers, including Celtic Bank and Bilt. The Forbes 30-Under-30 US 2026 list, released on 2 December 2025, features achievers who collectively raised $3.8 billion in funding. The average age is 27 years, with the youngest being 17.

Title: Are Bears Still in Control? Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shows Downside Signals Despite Fresh Inflows

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action has entered a conflicted phase, with renewed institutional inflows clashing against clear signs of market stress. After peaking above $126,000 earlier this year, the world’s largest crypto has retreated sharply and is now trading more than 30% below its all-time high. Related Reading: Bipartisan SAFE Crypto Act Unveiled: New Task Force To Combat Digital Asset Scams While some capital has returned through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), broader market signals suggest that selling pressure and weak participation continue to weigh on sentiment. Consequently, recent weeks have shown that Bitcoin’s recovery attempts remain fragile. A major source of downside pressure has been sustained selling by long-term holders. Data from K33 Research shows that roughly 1.6 million BTC that had been dormant for at least two years has been sold since early 2023. In 2025 alone, more than $300 billion worth of long-held Bitcoin has re-entered circulation. Analysts note that this type of distribution creates gradual, grinding declines rather than sharp capitulation events. With fewer active buyers in the market, the reactivated supply has proven difficult to absorb. Blockchain data indicates that the past month marked one of the heaviest long-term holder sell-offs in over five years, reinforcing the idea that structural selling remains unresolved. Institutional demand has shown brief signs of recovery. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $457 million in net inflows on December 17, snapping a multi-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund accounted for the majority of the inflows, with BlackRock also posting gains. Despite this rebound, ETF activity has been inconsistent. December inflows remain modest compared with earlier in the year, following nearly $3.5 billion in ETF outflows in November. Market observers say these inflows, while supportive, have not yet been large or sustained enough to offset ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders and cautious retail participation. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to flash bearish signals. The price has traded within a broad $82,000–$95,000 range for over a month, forming patterns such as an inverse cup and handle on the daily chart. Bitcoin has also slipped below key moving averages, while momentum indicators suggest sellers remain in control. Recent liquidation events have reinforced this weakness. Around $152 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated in a single day, and derivatives open interest has declined since the October market crash tied to macroeconomic shocks and tariff-related concerns.

Until selling from long-term holders eases and liquidity improves, downside risks are likely to remain part of the market’s near-term outlook.

He Must Call On The Power Of The People- Only We The People Can Do This- Trump Can't Do It Alone!" SummaryThe speaker urges President Trump to directly address the American people with urgency, calling on them to actively participate in saving the republic rather than portraying everything as already fixed.Key recommendations for Trump:Explain specific obstacles, such as 14 blue states blocking the "no tax on tips" policy by continuing to collect taxes, and thousands of judicial rulings that delay progress but eventually get overturned.Acknowledge achievements (e.g., gas prices down 30-50%, slowed inflation, reduced illegal border crossings by 96%) while being straightforward that serious challenges remain and the country faces existential threats from globalists.Avoid overly optimistic or technical messaging that downplays ongoing struggles; instead, emphasize the fight against deep state resistance, NGOs, and foreign influences.Mobilize citizens peacefully by enlisting their support, similar to how mobilized minority groups (e.g., Jewish and Muslim communities) defend their interests effectively despite small numbers.Frame the situation as a historic crisis requiring collective action, invoking figures like George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and JFK's "ask not what your country can do for you" call.Directly conscript the public into a "holy quest" for 1776 2.0, stressing that Trump cannot succeed alone and needs the people's full engagement in voting, activism, and support.The speaker criticizes Trump's recent speech as too technical, dense, and insufficiently urgent (grading it B+ to B-), arguing it focused on policy details and victories without adequately conveying the dire threat from globalist agendas (carbon taxes, forced injections, UN control, technocracy, replacement migration, Islamic jihad).Additional points:Past successes in Trump's first term came from advisors like Flynn, Bannon, Stone, and the speaker, who influenced policy.Warns of infighting among patriots and urges unity against known globalist plans to decentralize power from entities like BlackRock and the UN.Highlights perceived escalating threats, including Islamic jihad orders, attacks on Christians/Westerners, and left-Islam alliance for destabilization.Advises Trump to bypass legacy media, flood independent platforms (e.g., Rogan, Musk, Bannon), and repeatedly demand public involvement.Claims many of Trump's current plans (e.g., 1776 worldwide) originate from the speaker's ideas, which reach high-level White House listeners.The speaker expresses personal urgency, plans to send memos to the White House, TOPICS: KEYWORDS: alexjones; america; frootloops; ibtz; nutjobs; retarded; save; sillyhead; spammingfr; zot Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-24 next last 1 posted on 12/18/2025 3:24:53 PM PST by E.

Δ That’s according to a Thursday (Dec. 18) announcement from ADI Foundation, an Abu Dhabi-based non-profit founded with the goal of “empowering governments and institutions in emerging markets” via blockchain infrastructure. In the case of BlackRock, the asset manager has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ADI to explore accelerating blockchain adoption across financial markets and bolster the United Arab Emirates’ status as a world digital asset hub. “The partnership targets institution-grade tokenized asset structures, improved distribution, and clear regulatory frameworks that support market growth,” ADI said. The Mastercard collaboration is centered on blockchain-based payments and asset tokenization throughout the Middle East, and “brings stablecoin settlement, cross-border payments, and digital asset rails to the region with regulatory alignment built in.” And investment firm Franklin Templeton signed its MoU with the ADI Foundation to explore regulated digital asset infrastructure within Abu Dhabi Global Market. This effort “focuses on building compliant pathways for institutions to create and launch tokenized products.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It also explores creating digital rails for improved distribution and settlement, along with research into stablecoins and tokenized assets that are in keeping with regulatory requirements. “Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks,” ADI said. “These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation’s influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks.” In other blockchain news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the increasing presence of “mainstream incumbents” in this space, following a wave of crypto announcements from globally recognized names such as YouTube, BMW, HSBC, JPMorgan and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Put together, the report added, those announcements signal where digital assets are gaining traction. They share a common thread: settlement, rather than speculation or consumer hype. “Stablecoins and tokenized assets are increasingly being treated as tools for moving value with greater speed, programmability, and cost efficiency inside existing financial and commercial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. “What is emerging is a bifurcation in how blockchain is being adopted: as a new financial ecosystem on one end, and as a productized set of rails embedded into legacy institutions on the other.” Mastercard, BlackRock Join Middle East-Focused Blockchain Effort Everyday Planning and Shopping Lead Consumer Shift to AI Assistants Instacart Settles FTC Lawsuit Alleging Deceptive Advertising and Subscription Enrollments Coinbase Teams With Kalshi to Offer Prediction Market Access We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. AI visibility tracking. Brands can monitor mentions and sentiment across AI-generated answers. Competitive insights. Users gain real-time visibility into competitor presence and topic gaps. Enterprise impact. Marketing teams get immediate brand intelligence inside ChatGPT, streamlining analysis. Enterprise brands now face a new visibility challenge: tracking how AI models represent them in real-time answers. Conductor on Dec. 18 launched a ChatGPT app that delivers real-time AI search intelligence through a verified MCP server in OpenAI's App Directory. According to the company, the integration enables brands to track how they appear, are cited and are interpreted across AI-generated answers without leaving the ChatGPT interface. The app targets enterprise marketing and digital teams seeking to monitor brand visibility in large language model (LLM) outputs. Conductor asserts the tool uses a "Split Reasoning" architecture where ChatGPT handles user intent while Conductor's API provides verified data, aiming to reduce reliance on potentially outdated or hallucinated responses. The app is available as a free early access preview to Conductor customers with MCP server access and a paid ChatGPT plan. Future access will require a Conductor subscription. Key questions about Conductor’s ChatGPT app, data privacy and enterprise use. In June 2025, Conductor executed a dual transformation in go-to-market strategy and product platform. The company shifted from traditional lead generation toward content-driven brand building, a move VP of Marketing Lindsay Boyajian Hagan described as requiring "really hard conversations" across leadership. Simultaneously, Conductor unveiled Conductor AI, a platform designed to help brands win visibility in generative AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini. The bet paid off quickly. Conductor reported record Q3 results on Dec. 16, adding more than 50 new enterprise logos including Aladdin by BlackRock, Four Seasons and TD Bank. Net revenue retention exceeded 125% and monthly active usage grew 132% year over year. Forrester named Conductor a Leader in its Q3 2025 SEO Wave, citing superior content SEO, AI-enabled automation and an intuitive interface. AI-powered search is fundamentally reshaping how brands reach audiences, forcing enterprise marketers to rethink visibility strategies built for a pre-LLM era. The transition from traditional SEO to answer engine optimization (AEO) reflects how large language models now mediate between brands and consumers. Brands must measure new KPIs beyond rankings: narrative inclusion, citation frequency and sentiment within AI outputs. Industry experts project a 25-50% decline in organic website traffic, with Gartner predicting a 50% drop by 2028. Approximately 27% of Americans have replaced traditional search engines with AI chatbots. Enterprise platforms now include: Brand visibility tracking across AI overviews and LLM responses Sentiment analysis within generative AI environments Citation frequency measurement in AI-generated content Competitive benchmarking in answer engine results How are brands adapting to the shift in content discoverability? By focusing on customer engagement, predictive capabilities and continuous analysis while monitoring brand visibility across AI platforms. We're proud to be the only enterprise platform in our category included at launch, a recognition of the trusted enterprise-grade intelligence we've been building for years. - Conductor Leadership According to Conductor, the ChatGPT app introduces several capabilities designed for enterprise brand monitoring. The company differentiates from competitors like Semrush and Ahrefs by asserting its MCP server delivers AI search performance intelligence—including mentions, citations and sentiment—rather than static keyword datasets. Conductor, founded in 2006, provides an SEO and content intelligence platform tailored for mid-size to large enterprises. Its primary users are organic marketing teams, content teams and digital product managers focused on search visibility and website performance. Have a tip to share with our editorial team?

Title: Why 2025 Became the Year Crypto Stopped Chasing Hype
URL: https://beincrypto.com/biggest-crypto-narratives-from-2025/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T21:02:52Z
Full Content:
Written byCamila Grigera Naón Edited byMohammad Shahid In 2025, the most influential narratives in crypto shifted away from hype toward utility and systems delivering measurable, real-world impact. The year marked a transition to production-ready systems that enhance the global movement and settlement of value. Experts from SynFutures, Brickken, and Cake Wallet said that stablecoins, privacy, tokenized assets, and applied AI shaped adoption through genuine demand rather than speculation. In many ways, 2025 was an exceptional year. It marked the first time crypto reached this level of institutional integration, with users often interacting with crypto rails without consciously engaging with “crypto” as a product. While the sector remained shaped by volatility, only a few crypto narratives stood out for their practical utility. By contrast, those driven primarily by hype and sensationalism faded quickly. In conversations with BeInCrypto, industry representatives offered a consistent assessment: narratives grounded in integration and execution endured, while novelty-driven stories steadily lost relevance. Despite a wide range of narratives, stablecoins consistently emerged as the most frequently cited theme. Stablecoins have helped bridge the gap between risk-tolerant crypto participants and more cautious users seeking limited exposure to an industry long associated with volatility. By maintaining a peg to assets such as the US dollar or gold, stablecoins positioned themselves as a more reliable alternative to other types of digital assets. Their borderless nature also gave them particular appeal over fiat currency. Our 2026 Infra Year Ahead Report is out now!Stablecoins have become the most important infrastructure story in crypto.Every fintech wave promised to fix payments but just layered better UX on the same infrastructure. Revolut and Nubank delivered better experiences while… pic.twitter.com/zEhC6sndmv Regulatory milestones, including the passage of the GENIUS Act, further strengthened confidence in stablecoins, allowing their utility and infrastructure efficiency to stand on their own merits. “Stablecoins solved a very concrete, everyday problem: moving and settling money efficiently across borders without relying on slow, fragmented, and expensive banking rails,” said Brickken CEO Edwin Mata. “For users, they provided access to digital dollars and euros in jurisdictions where banking access is limited, costly, or unreliable,” he added. The impact was concrete, not theoretical, as Stripe and Visa integrated stablecoins into settlement and treasury operations. At the same time, Circle enabled businesses to use USDC as working capital rather than as a speculative asset. As stablecoins matured into dependable settlement tools, they enabled the expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). According to SynFutures CEO Rachel Lin, RWAs managed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto. However, the way this was achieved wasn’t comprehensive. The success of RWAs was actually much more selective than previously anticipated. “Tokenized treasuries, funds, and yield products showed real traction because they offered tangible benefits: better settlement, composability, and broader access,” Lin told BeInCrypto, adding, “However, 2025 also clarified that RWAs only work when legal clarity, liquidity, and credible issuers are in place. The narrative moved from experimentation to execution, but it’s still early.” The evidence spoke for itself, with large banks and asset managers relying on tokenization to improve efficiency. Earlier this week, JPMorgan launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, marking a move beyond internal testing or pilot programs. Meanwhile, asset managers such as BlackRock expanded tokenized fund offerings, and banks integrated stablecoins into treasury and settlement workflows. Another narrative that drew widespread attention across industries, particularly within the crypto sector, was artificial intelligence (AI). Early AI hype centered on fears that autonomous agents would replace human decision-making, a narrative that quickly lost momentum. What endured was a more practical focus on how AI could enhance the user experience by helping individuals understand exposure and manage risk. “AI added real value where it reduced cognitive and operational complexity—particularly in trading interfaces, risk controls, and decision support. Products that used AI to help users understand exposure, automate execution within guardrails, or avoid costly mistakes delivered tangible improvements,” Lin explained. The rise of AI agents also generated significant attention, though expectations became more measured over the year. Their success depended less on autonomy and more on trust, auditability, and user-defined limits. Use cases such as liquidity management, automated strategy execution, and treasury optimization demonstrated potential when clear guardrails were in place. Yet, as AI became more deeply embedded in crypto products, it also sharpened long-standing concerns around data exposure. This convergence pushed privacy from a niche concern into a central narrative of 2025. Privacy emerged as one of the most consequential crypto narratives of the year, driven by growing awareness of how financial systems expose user information and behavior. spent last night deep in the a16z state of crypto 2025 report…and wow, privacy is quietly becoming the next trillion-dollar narrative> google searches for “crypto privacy” and “financial privacy” are up 10x since january> total flows through railgun passed $200M> zcash’s… https://t.co/zv36Kcgi10 pic.twitter.com/T8p3EsR9Hn As a result, long-standing concerns around data visibility moved to the forefront. In parallel, privacy, once treated as a niche preference, increasingly appeared as a structural requirement. “One of the biggest narrative shifts in the industry to date happened this year, where people woke up to the need (and market demand) for simple, approachable privacy for their money,” Seth for Privacy, Vice President of Cake Wallet, told BeInCrypto. Rising usage of Monero, increased global media attention on Zcash, and a broader shift toward privacy features across stablecoin and Layer 2 networks reinforced this pivot. “All of that solves one of the biggest painpoints of crypto for users – how do I retain privacy that I have today in the financial system or with cash, with the decentralization and power of crypto?” Seth added. The rise of privacy solutions, alongside other successful narratives of the past year, reinforced that crypto adoption increasingly hinges exclusively on utility. As crypto continues to mature, success may be defined not by how loudly it announces itself, but by how reliably it works.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The AI talent wars show no signs of slowing, with companies making headlines weekly for their latest high-profile hires. This includes engineers they are poaching from each other or acqui-hiring but also, increasingly, senior executives that can support them as they scale up. Less than 10 days after Slack CEO Denise Dresser became OpenAI’s chief revenue officer, former British finance minister George Osborne announced he was joining Sam Altman’s company. Shortly thereafter, the crypto exchange Coinbase separately appointed Osborne to lead its internal advisory council. The announcements drew particular attention in the U.K., where commenters noted that Osborne joins a growing list of former British politicians now working for major U.S. tech companies. If you’re not familiar with him or this trend, here’s what you need to know. A former conservative Member of Parliament, George Osborne served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 — a role equivalent to that of a finance minister or treasury secretary in other countries, and currently held by Rachel Reeves. After Prime Minister David Cameron resigned following the 2016 Brexit vote, Osborne eventually left public office in 2017. Alongside multiple other engagements, including a part-time advisory role for the investment firm BlackRock, he served as editor of the Evening Standard from 2017 to 2020. During that period, he also co-founded a VC firm, 9yards Capital, with his brother Theo and Theo’s brother-in-law David Fisher as co-founders and managing partners. Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase. Osborne announced on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote on LinkedIn. Introduced in May 2025, OpenAI for Countries is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture. OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the Stargate project, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently building five new data centers across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.” As OpenAI turns 10, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “Political Currency,” underscores his extensive political connections. His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told Reuters. Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas. According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.” Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies. These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief for over six years, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic. This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure highly lucrative private sector positions. The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector isn’t new. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers like Shein — hire former government officials to help navigate regulations and influence policy. Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’” Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared. Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/18/2025 11:46:36 AM PST by E. Pluribus Unum In a move that’s raising alarms across the nation, BlackRock through its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has surged into direct ownership of U.S. energy infrastructure, shifting from passive investor to hands on controller of critical utilities and grids. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved a $6.2 billion takeover of Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, by a BlackRock led consortium with Canada Pension Plan in October 2025, granting private equity majority control over power serving 150,000 customers. Meanwhile, GIP is in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major player with renewable assets nationwide. In Texas, BlackRock’s footprint grows via GIP owned firms like Eolian, developing massive battery storage projects such as the 400 MW/1.8 GWh Padua Complex near San Antonio to stabilize ERCOT amid retiring fossil plants and exploding AI driven demand. After retreating from ESG commitments and exiting net zero alliances under political pressure, Texas removed BlackRock from its fossil fuel boycott list in June 2025, paving the way for deeper ties including Larry Fink co hosting energy investment summits with state leaders. Summary of Video TranscriptThe transcript from an InfoWars report by John Bowne criticizes BlackRock's expansion into U.S. energy infrastructure following its 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).It highlights BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's positive view of infrastructure investing as a "golden age," driven by decarbonization, AI demand, and capital needs.The report alleges BlackRock is shifting to direct ownership and control of critical utilities, potentially prioritizing profits over affordable rates.Specific claims include:A BlackRock-led consortium (with Canada Pension Plan) gaining approval in October 2025 for a $6.2 billion takeover of ALLETE (parent of Minnesota Power), serving 150,000 customers, despite opposition from consumer advocates concerned about rate hikes and reduced accountability.GIP in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major renewable energy player.BlackRock's investments in Texas projects, such as battery storage via GIP-owned firms, to support grid stability amid AI growth and fossil plant retirements.It mentions a Texas Attorney General lawsuit against BlackRock over ESG policies allegedly manipulating energy markets, and notes Blackstone's separate ongoing process to acquire the Texas-New Mexico grid operator (TXNM Energy).The report expresses concerns that private equity firms, having exhausted retail sectors, are targeting infrastructure, potentially loading debt on utilities, subsidizing big tech, and eroding public oversight.

Meanwhile, GIP is in advanced talks for a potential $38 billion acquisition of AES Corporation, a major player with renewable assets nationwide. In Texas, BlackRock’s footprint grows via GIP owned firms like Eolian, developing massive battery storage projects such as the 400 MW/1.8 GWh Padua Complex near San Antonio to stabilize ERCOT amid retiring fossil plants and exploding AI driven demand. After retreating from ESG commitments and exiting net zero alliances under political pressure, Texas removed BlackRock from its fossil fuel boycott list in June 2025, paving the way for deeper ties including Larry Fink co hosting energy investment summits with state leaders.

Title: Ray Dalio Joins Billionaires Funding ‘Trump Accounts’ for Children

The U.S. government’s “Trump accounts” have quickly attracted billionaire backers. Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio is the latest wealthy figure to support the initiative, pledging roughly $75 million to seed 300,000 accounts in his home state of Connecticut. His grant will add an extra $250 to accounts in Connecticut zip codes where the median income is $150,000 or less. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The savings accounts, set to launch next July for children with a U.S. Social Security number, were introduced earlier this year as part of Trump’s tax bill. Babies born between 2025 and 2028 will automatically receive a $1,000 deposit from the U.S. Treasury Department. All children under the age of 18 are eligible to open an account. The government is encouraging parents, philanthropists and local governments to contribute to the tax-advantaged accounts, which can be invested in stock market index funds and later convert into traditional IRAs when recipients turn 18. Funds can eventually be used for expenses such as education, job training and buying a first home. Dalio, whose net worth is estimated at $15.4 billion, praised the accounts as a tool for building financial literacy among children. “These Trump Accounts are great not just because they put money into stocks for these young people but also because they draw their attention toward how finance, stocks, companies and capitalism work to improve society and can work for them,” he wrote in a post on X yesterday (Dec. 17). His announcement mirrors a similar contribution from Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Earlier this month, the couple unveiled a $6.25 million donation that will place $250 into the Trump accounts of 25 million children aged ten and under who aren’t eligible for the Treasury’s seed deposit. The Dalios and the Dells have collaborated philanthropically before. In 2020, the Dalios purchased 60,000 Dell laptops to support virtual education during the Covid pandemic. Dalio’s broader charitable efforts also include more than $7 million in contributions to Dalio Philanthropies, his family foundation, as well as roughly $280 million donated to nonprofits in Connecticut. The Dalios’ support for Trump accounts also ties into a new component of the initiative known as the “50 State Challenge” which aims to encourage philanthropists to expand funding in their local communities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the program during a press conference yesterday. “Ray has made the first move, but we welcome other donors and foundations in Connecticut and across the country to join him,” Bessent said, adding that 20 state governments are also in talks about supplementing the accounts. The government has also launched trumpaccounts.gov, a website dedicated to the initiative that highlights “additional support” from at least eight companies nationwide. In most cases, corporate participation has taken the form of matching government contributions, with companies such as Dell, BNY and BlackRock pledging to supplement the Treasury’s $1,000 deposits for their employees’ children. Not every billionaire, however, is convinced. While calling the accounts a “nice gesture,” Elon Musk took to X yesterday to describe the initiative as unnecessary in light of A.I.’s economic potential. “There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income,” Musk wrote, echoing a Silicon Valley belief that technology-driven productivity gains will eventually provide people with steady, recurring payouts.
