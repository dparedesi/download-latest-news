Title: UK bond rout draws Truss comparisons

British government bonds tumbled sharply yesterday as a tearful appearance by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in parliament a day after the government backed down on its welfare reforms reignited concern over Britain's finances. Reeves was attending Prime Minister's Questions following the government's decision to sharply scale back plans to cut benefits. The sharp plunge in British assets immediately drew comparisons with Liz Truss' short-lived premiership nearly three years ago, which was derailed by a bond market selloff. Investors are monitoring Reeves' status after the UK government's reversal on welfare reforms meant the plans would no longer save taxpayers any money, shredding the margin Britain relies on to meet its fiscal rules. The welfare reform U-turn was "signalling that the Labour Party is a lot less concerned about what the gilt market thinks," said Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager, TwentyFour Asset Management. "I would have thought it was seared into politicians' memories what happened to Liz Truss," he added. The yield on the 10-year government bond, or gilt, rose as much as 22 basis points on the day at one point, to 4.681%, as investors ditched British debt. It then recovered somewhat to 4.60%. At its peak, the benchmark yield was set for its largest one-day jump since October 2022, the aftermath of Truss' chaotic package of large, unfunded tax cuts that scuttled her premiership. During the depths of the 2022 crisis, the yield on the 10-year gilt rose by 50 bps in a single day at one point. The selloff also hit very long dated gilts, and 30-year yields rose 17 basis points. "The latest headline would suggest more uncertainty with regards to the current government," said Simon Blundel, head of European fundamental fixed income investments at BlackRock.

Investors in bonds around the world are growing increasingly nervous about government deficits from Japan to the US, with Britain seen as among the more vulnerable. Earlier yesterday, British assets were trading slightly lower, but the selloff intensified rapidly after Reeves appeared alongside Prime Minister Kier Starmer during the weekly prime minister's questions looking exhausted and upset. Traders also focused on comments from Starmer seemingly not endorsing Reeves, though Starmer's press secretary later said Reeves has his full support, and she was upset because of "a personal matter". Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her commitment to self-imposed fiscal rules, limiting the amount Britain will borrow, and, analysts said, yesterday's market moves reflected fears that she would be replaced, creating even more uncertainty. Reeves has also been blamed by some Labour members of parliament for pushing for billions of pounds of savings that were described as cruel and targeting the most vulnerable. Sterling dropped around 1% against the dollar and also weakened sharply against the euro, which rose 0.8% to its highest on the pound in two months. Britain's domestically focused mid-cap index was down 1.3% on the day, sharply underperforming European stocks. "The deficit is going to have to be closed somehow, clearly the signal from yesterday is that can't come from substantial spending cuts, I don’t think it’s possible for the government to borrow the money, that leaves tax rises," Nick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe, said. "It's a pretty ugly outlook for sterling," he added. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Jio-Blackrock will expand Indian stock market, but not a threat to first-generation founders, says Zerodhas Nitin Kamath

Full Content:
New Delhi [India], : If any company can expand the current market, it is Jio-Blackrock with its huge distribution network, but it will not be a threat to first generation founders noted online brokerage platform Zerodha's Chief Executive Officer , Nithin Kamath, on the social media platform 'X'.Nithin Kamath via his post on 'X' expressed optimism regarding the same. He said, "Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news." Kamath further added that, "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might."However, he also raised concerns about the expansion of the Indian stock market. "The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians," he said.Kamath also shared his opinion on what his thoughts are on broking. He believes that Zerodha is not something which is following 'vanity metrics' and the principle online brokerage platform is to 'stay to stay profitable.' "At the heart of our philosophy is to always do the right thing for customers," Nithin Kamath said. Kamath also emphasised that Zerodha's strategy is not to pressure consumers to trade and to make sure that there are no obtrusive notifications, dark patterns, etc., adding that customers who trade less have a better chance of long-term success. However, Nithin Kamath also reflected on the role of other financial services businesses in the sector, who are constantly seeking to grow their business at any cost. "And yeah, I still feel our real competition is going to be more from first-generation founders who are running, breathing, and always thinking about broking. I somehow don't feel it will really come from incumbents. This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," said Nithin Kamath.

ByForbes Press Releases ByForbes Press Releases, Forbes Staff. Red Bull’s Chalerm Yoovidhya & family retain top spot SINGAPORE (July 3, 2025) – The combined wealth of tycoons on the 2025 Forbes list of Thailand’s 50 Richest rose more than 11% to US$170.5 billion, despite slower-than-expected economic growth amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. The complete list can be found here, as well as in the July issue of Forbes Asia and the August issue of Forbes Thailand. Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dollar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans. The Chearavanont brothers of the Charoen Pokphand group retained their position as the country’s second-richest with their net worth up by 23% to $35.7 billion. The group is doubling down on digital infrastructure, investing $1 billion with BlackRock to build data centers. The group’s fintech unit Ascend Money recently got approval to set up a virtual bank. Energy-and-telecoms tycoon Sarath Ratanavadi climbed two spots to No. 3 for the first time with $12 billion, up from $9.2 billion last year. Completing the merger between his Gulf Energy Development and Intouch Holdings and listing the combined entity in April as Gulf Development powered his ascent. Taking the No. 4 spot is beverage tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, whose net worth was relatively flat at $10.5 billion. In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Rounding out the top five on the list is the Central Group’s Chirathivat family, who saw their wealth decline 13% to $8.6 billion, as weak consumer sentiment impacted the retail sector. A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s (No. 18, $1.4 billion) wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs passed away since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family (No. 6, $4.2 billion) and the Viddayakorn family (No. 30, $1.1 billion). Four people fell from the ranks, including renewable energy magnate Somphote Ahunai, whose Energy Absolute faced financial stress. The minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million. The top 10 richest in Thailand are: This list was compiled using shareholding and financial information obtained from the families and individuals, stock exchanges and analysts, the Stock Exchange of Thailand and regulatory agencies.

The asset’s price has fallen 48% since it hit $293 in January, not long after the debut of U.S. President Donald Trump’s meme coin. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto-focused ETFs this year, Wednesday’s debut represents a new chapter “in the crypto ETF story,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. As the only U.S. federally chartered digital asset bank, Anchorage is safeguarding the ETF’s digital assets, while using its platform to stake the Solana. McCauley said that Anchorage’s innovation would hopefully translate to other products. “The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” he said. Anchorage began letting institutions stake Ethereum in the U.S. in 2022, not long before Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model. In April, BlackRock tapped Anchorage as a custodian to safeguard some funds for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Anchorage’s services mirror a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. As far as crypto ETFs in the U.S. go, many asset managers have chosen Coinbase as a custodian, including Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. Unlike spot crypto ETFs approved by the SEC last year, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act. That distinction required a qualified custodian, like Anchorage, to hold the fund’s assets. On Wednesday, the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF got off to a “healthy start,” Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart wrote on X, formerly Twitter, pointing to $8 million in trading volume that the fund notched in its first 20 minutes.

The Chearavanont brothers’ agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group) has lately been on a digital and regional expansion drive. In June, its fintech arm Ascend Money secured approval to establish a virtual bank, which paves the way for the firm to leverage its digital platform TrueMoney, with its countrywide base of 34 million users. ss A month earlier, True IDC, the data center and cloud services arm of the group’s telecoms giant True, which is led by its chairman Suphachai Chearavanont, teamed up with a BlackRock unit to invest $1 billion over the next three to five years to build data centers in Thailand, an up and coming ASEAN digital hub. After its 2023 merger with rival Total Access Communications, True is now the country’s largest mobile operator with nearly 49 million subscribers. With an eye on regional expansion, CP Group will be setting up a $1 billion private equity fund with Philippine sovereign wealth fund Maharlika Investment Corp. to invest in agriculture, digital innovation and renewable energy in the Philippines. Over the past 12 months, the net worth of the Chearavanont brothers has gone up by $6.7 billion to $35.7 billion.

This story is part of Forbes’ coverage of Thailand’s Richest 2025. See the full list here. Thailand’s economy is growing at a slower-than-expected pace amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. While a stronger baht mostly offset the 14% decline of the stock market index from a year ago, a huge boost in the fortunes of the top three propelled a more than 11% rise in combined wealth to $170.5 billion. ss Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dol­lar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya.

Amid weak consumer sentiment in the retail sector, the Chirathivat family’s wealth was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Last October, the group got a new partner: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund acquired a 40% stake in British retailer Selfridges from Austria’s Signa Holdings. (Central group retains 60%.) A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended.

Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family and the Viddayakorn family.

These credits, which represent greenhouse gas reductions from projects like reforestation or renewable energy, are often bought by companies aiming to offset their emissions. The firms will focus on how blockchain handles credit lifecycle management, data compatibility and registry access. "Our shared aim is to establish standardized infrastructure that enhances information and price transparency, paving the way for financial innovation and increased market liquidity," said Keerthi Moudgal, head of product at Kinexys Digital Assets. The initiative underscores JPMorgan's growing presence in the red-hot tokenization space, a sector that has attracted global banks and asset managers such as BlackRock, HSBC and Citi. Tokenization is the process of using blockchain rails to transact with traditional financial instruments, promising more efficient operations, around-the-clock settlements and increased transparency. JPMorgan has been an early leader operating its own private blockchain network Kinexys, formerly known as Onyx and JPM Coin, which now settles $2 billion in daily transactions, according to the bank. It also piloted last month a deposit token called JPMD on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Coinbase.

Title: Solana’s first ETF goes live as crypto analysts predict surge of new altcoin funds

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and now Solana. The crypto industry is flooding traditional markets with assets pegged to cryptocurrencies that mom-and-pop investors can buy up from their brokerage accounts. On Wednesday morning, the first Solana exchange-traded fund, or ETF, went live on Cboe BZX, a stock exchange based in Chicago. Dubbed the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, the fund is available to investors who want exposure to Solana, one of the top cryptocurrencies whose market capitalization is about $81 billion, according to data from Binance. In addition to tracking the price of Solana, the fund, managed jointly by REX Financial and its sister firm Osprey Funds, also pays holders a variable monthly dividend whose current rate is 7.3% The price of Solana jumped 2% after markets opened Wednesday to now around $151. The ETF has seen inflows of about $20 million before midday, Greg King, founder and CEO of REX Financial, told Fortune. When they were first launched, cryptocurrency ETFs seemed exotic to many retail investors, but the successive debut of a Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now a Solana fund suggest the products are gaining a broader appeal. The ETFs also represent an entry point for new crypto investors at a time when brokerages like Vanguard don’t let their users plug into a crypto exchange and buy the newest, hottest token. The arrival of spot crypto ETFs, or traditional market wrappers around the current price of a cryptocurrency, allow traditional and institutional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolio to crypto. For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., even though similar products were available in Europe. The SEC worried that the crypto-tied assets would be prone to market manipulation. Grayscale, a crypto investment firm, battled the regulator in the courts, and, in October 2023, a judge said the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF were “arbitrary and capricious.” In January 2024, a slew of spot Bitcoin ETFs went live, including an entry into the category from the asset management titan BlackRock. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, almost $50 billion have poured into the investment products, according to data from SoSoValue. In July 2024, BlackRock and other issuers launched ETFs for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. And then, other issuers filed ETF applications for a slew of other cryptocurrencies, including Solana. “I frankly think it would have been more difficult with the previous administration,” said King, the CEO of REX Financial. Now, amid a more friendly financial regime under President Donald Trump, analysts anticipate that the SEC will approve many of the applications to launch cryptocurrency-tied funds. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025,” James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said on X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ethereum ETFs forecast to attract $10 billion by late 2025, says Bitwise CIO

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees Ethereum ETFs surging due to easy adoption via tokenized stocks and stablecoins. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicted that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could experience up to $10 billion in inflows during the second half of 2025. His forecast, made on July 2, builds on the strong momentum observed over the past months, with Ethereum ETFs already bringing in $1.17 billion in inflows in June alone. According to SoSoValue data, Ethereum ETFs have seen total inflows of approximately $1.5 billion for the first half of 2025, despite a brief dip in March when $403 million was pulled out. These funds have recorded inflows in five of the year’s first six months, underlining the sustained investor interest and bolstering Hougan’s optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year. Hougan attributes the growing interest in Ethereum to its expanding role as a platform for tokenized assets, including stocks and stablecoins. The Bitwise executive believes that integrating these assets onto Ethereum provides a straightforward narrative that traditional investors can easily grasp. According to him: “Flows into Ethereum ETFs are going to accelerate significantly in H2. The combination of stablecoins & stocks moving over Ethereum is an easy-to-grasp narrative for traditional investors.” Ethereum has firmly established itself as the backbone of the crypto industry. Its dominance in the stablecoin market and increasing adoption by major institutions like BlackRock and Robinhood for asset tokenization have made it a key player in the sector. Meanwhile, the anticipated approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs will be another major catalyst for Ethereum ETF growth in the year’s second half. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that crypto staking does not qualify as securities offerings. Market observers believe this guidance paves the way for new Ethereum-based financial products, which would attract more attention to the current spot ETFs. Additionally, the Ethereum network itself is undergoing significant upgrades, with the Ethereum Foundation focusing on scalability through developments like the Pectra upgrade and the upcoming Glamsterdam release. Market observers believe these enhancements will solidify Ethereum’s infrastructure and position the network for long-term success. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Generating More Revenue Than its Flagship S&P 500 Fund
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-now-generates-more-revenue-than-its-flagship-s-and-p-500-fund
Time Published: 2025-07-02T17:29:49Z

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager’s most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg data. Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV’s $624 billion in total assets — IBIT’s higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly. While IBIT’s management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund

At the world’s biggest asset manager, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than its signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index. The roughly $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) has seen a torrent of cash from institutional and retail investors alike, drawing inflows in all but one of the last 18 months. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund brings in an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees, based on back-of-the-envelope math calculated by Bloomberg as of July 1. That slightly edges out the $187.1 million made by BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which is nearly nine times larger at around $624 billion in assets, and charges just 0.03%. “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” said Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” BlackRock declined to comment. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading in Jan. 2024, IBIT has attracted $52 billion of the combined $54 billion in net inflows, and it holds more than 55% of all Bitcoin ETF assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the 25-year-old IVV is the third-largest ETF among the more than 4,300 products in the US, only trailing Vanguard Group and State Street Investment Management funds that also track the S&P 500. A surge of cash rushed into Bitcoin ETFs after US regulators reluctantly opened the door to mainstream adoption, prompting an influx of capital from hedge funds, pensions and banks. IBIT, which has an expense ratio similar to its peers, is already a top-20 ETF by trading volume, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” said Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where it’s perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust.” Bitcoin’s supremacy over smaller altcoins has widened, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading above $100,000, propelled by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Wall Street’s buying spree has been led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has used its cash to accumulate a mountain of Bitcoin. Hedge funds have also piled into the firm’s convertible debt, capitalizing on arbitrage trades that involve buying the bonds while shorting the stock. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bolt’s millennial founder has just ‘killed’ its unlimited PTO perk because it was actually causing burnout

Time Published: 2025-07-02T15:43:35Z

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. On paper, unlimited PTO sounds like the holy grail of benefits a company can offer its employees—the ability to take endless vacations and avoid burnout. But for the $11 billion fintech startup Bolt, (not to be confused with the Uber rival, also called Bolt), unlimited PTO has been a double-edged sword that has caused more problems than solutions. “We just killed unlimited PTO at Bolt,” its founder and CEO, Ryan Breslow has just revealed on LinkedIn. “It sounds progressive, but it’s totally broken. When time off is undefined, the good ones don’t take PTO. The bad ones take too much.” While this is contrary to research from financial services firm Empower, which found that employees with unlimited PTO take on average 16 days off versus 14 days for those with limited policies, Breslow said much of that time was taken off by “b performers”—leaving high performers to pick up the slack. “This leads to A-performer burnout. B-performer luxuries. And feelings of unfairness across the board,” the millennial boss explained. “So we’re flipping the script: no more confusion. Every Bolter now gets four weeks of paid vacation (yes, the traditional corporate standard), with the opportunity to accrue more with tenure. Not optional,” Breslow added. “We mandate everyone take all four weeks off.” Now, the company is capping annual leave at around four weeks—but Bolt workers can accrue a maximum of 25 days leave with tenure. “We believe a team executing at the pace and scale we do deserves real, protected time off, not vague promises,” a Bolt spokesperson echoed in a statement to Fortune. “When we saw in our own data that our A-players weren’t taking enough time away, we knew we had to fix it.” Breslow rejoined Bolt this year after a rocky few months that included rounds of layoffs and a failed fundraising attempt that carried a $14 billion valuation. It was last valued at $11 billion in 2022, with investment coming from top firms like BlackRock. Reshaping Bolt’s culture has been a centrepiece of the 31-year-old’s changes since retaking the helm in March. On top of the PTO change, Breslow also publicly announced the company was doing away with its HR department in favor of “people ops”—which is more focused on efficiency over fluff, he wrote on LinkedIn. “HR is the wrong energy, format, and approach,” he said. “People ops empowers managers, streamlines decision making, and keeps the company moving at lightning speed.” The company also had some wins in recent weeks, including securing partnerships with Klarna and Palantir, but the only way to make sure that continues to happen, Breslow said, is to ensure top talent can thrive. “If we’re asking people to move fast, build hard, and operate at the highest level, we need to protect their recovery time with the same intensity,” Breslow said. “Execution requires clarity. That applies to PTO, too.” Despite growing calls from workers for better work-life balance and indications that unlimited PTO could lead to outperforming the S&P 500, the policy remains embraced by just 7% of employers, according to SHRM. Netflix is considered to be an early pioneer of the policy. Reed Hastings, the billionaire cofounder of the streaming service, has said he takes six weeks of vacation each year—and encourages his employees to do the same. “I take a lot of vacation and I’m hoping that certainly sets an example,” the former Netflix CEO said in 2015. “It is helpful. You often do your best thinking when you’re off hiking in some mountain or something. You get a different perspective on things.” Today, the company claims to not have a strict 9-to-5 workday–or even holiday schedule—and encourages workers to take time off to observe what’s important and when their mind and body need a break. More than a quarter of workers, or 26%, say they would consider a lower-paying job if it offered the unlimited option. At the same time, shifting to the policy has sometimes backfired. In 2014, Tribune Publishing—the company behind the Chicago Tribune and formerly the Los Angeles Times—attempted to transition from limited to unlimited PTO, but faced backlash from its employees. Less than two weeks later, the publisher reversed course after receiving “valuable input from employees,” citing that the new policy actually just “created confusion and concern within the company.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 'Not A Business Where Deep Pockets Mean A Large Moat': Nithin Kamath On Jio-Blackrock

Zerodha Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Nithin Kamath said on Wednesday that he does not see a competitive threat from the mutual funds and investment company Jio-Blackrock receiving a stock-broking license. Jio-Blackrock was formed as a 50:50 joint venture between telecommunication company Jio an arm of Reliance Industries Ltd., and Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, based in the US. The company paired Jio's digital reach and interconnected software service networks with Blackrock's 'Alladin Platform' to provide tech-driven analytics to customers. Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news. The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians.If anyone can expand the markets beyond theâ¦ Kamath, in a post on social media platform X, said he sees primary competition coming in from first-generation founders who he described as "running, breathing, and always thinking about broking". "This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," the co-founder of the discount brokerage firm said. Kamath said that Jio-Blackrock may expand the breadth in participation for investments saying that it is largely limited to 10 crore Indians. "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might," he said. The joint venture reportedly aims to provide its services to people across various income groups to reach those consumers who don't usually have the capital to invest by offering low-risk investment plans with a minimum investment of Rs 500. Kamath said that Zerodha was not chasing "vanity metrics" and isn't focused on using plans to draw customers in and changing the pricing structure once they have them. He enumerated the firm's principal philosophy as being against pushing customers to invest and making sure they don't have unnecessary notifications or dark patterns. "We understand that in the long term, the odds of success are better if customers trade less; most of our product decisions are based on this," he said. He said the company was "in it for the long haul" and focused on providing product offerings that help their customers grow. "I don't know if you can say the same about many other financial services businesses in the industry, who are constantly looking to grow at any cost," Kamath said.

Title: JP Morgan’s blockchain unit plans to tokenise carbon credits

Time Published: 2025-07-02T13:34:36Z

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is taking steps to modernize the voluntary carbon market by testing a new blockchain-based system for tokenizing carbon credits. The initiative is being led by Kinexys, the bank’s blockchain unit, in collaboration with S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry, and the International Carbon Registry. The goal is to determine whether blockchain technology can effectively track the ownership and lifecycle of carbon credits from issuance through retirement. Tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets as digital tokens on a blockchain, has gained traction across Wall Street. Institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank have explored their use to simplify and accelerate the settlement of traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds. By applying this technology to carbon credits, JPMorgan and its partners aim to address persistent challenges in the carbon market, including inefficiency, lack of transparency, market fragmentation, and the absence of standardized systems. According to JPMorgan, a unified tokenized ecosystem could enable carbon credits to move seamlessly between buyers and sellers, improving overall market functionality. Alastair Northway, head of natural resource advisory at JPMorgan Payments, believes the voluntary carbon market is “ripe for innovation.” He emphasized that blockchain tokenization could underpin a more transparent and interoperable global system, potentially increasing liquidity and trust in the market. Enhanced visibility into pricing and project data is one potential benefit of adopting digital infrastructure. A carbon credit typically signifies one metric ton of carbon dioxide that has either been removed from or not released into the atmosphere. These credits often originate from renewable energy or forestry projects. In a tokenized system, each credit would exist as a digital asset on a blockchain, offering a verifiable and tradable representation of the environmental benefit. Despite growing institutional and governmental interest in carbon trading, the market has struggled with credibility issues. Allegations of greenwashing and shortcomings in project effectiveness have raised doubts about the integrity of some carbon offset programs. JPMorgan itself has previously financed carbon projects and purchased carbon removal credits and now aims to be recognized as the “carbon bank of choice.” In a report released Wednesday, JPMorgan noted that while carbon credits are “poised to mature as market infrastructure strengthens,” that outcome is far from guaranteed. The bank warned that failure to address market integrity issues or foster innovation could further damage confidence in a market that has recently stalled after a period of contraction. The report also referenced earlier efforts by other organizations to tokenize carbon credits, some of which raised concerns about double-counting and transactions involving already-retired credits. Such missteps have undermined trust and highlighted the need for more robust frameworks to support digital carbon markets. As part of this new trial, JPMorgan and its partners aim to avoid those pitfalls by working with established registry systems and prioritizing accountability and traceability.

Recent industry analyses, including insights from prominent digital asset commentators such as @AltcoinGordon and IBM Quantum’s Jay Gambetta, the severity of the threat. Quantum computing is rapidly approaching the capability to break the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that underpins Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to cybersecurity researchers, over 4 million BTC, approximately 25% of the usable supply, are stored in addresses with exposed public keys, making them prime targets once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has formally recognized this risk by listing quantum computing as a material threat in its Bitcoin ETF filings.

Title: “What If” US Bombing of Iran Was Not What Meets the Eye? Peter Koenig

Unconfirmed reports from different sources paint a different scenario from the ones that have made the mainstream, as well as non-mainstream news about President Trump’s intervention in Iran, bombing of nuclear research sites, as described in this article and this. Since nothing is confirmed or proven, however to some extent credible, let us approach this topic with “What If”…. What if previous assessments of President Trump’s actions on Iran are wrong? What if before June 22, when the United States Air Force and Navy attacked three Iranian nuclear research facilities: Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, in an operation called “Midnight Hammer”, President Trump told / warned Iran of the attack, so that they could evacuate all the nuclear material and people from the sites? Therefore, it would appear, no enriched material (up to 60% according to the IAEA) was destroyed. This may be the reason why the IAEA reported no radiation after the attack. Also, apparently nobody was killed or hurt during the attack. Trump also informed Putin of his plan. What if the plan was telling Israel that he, President Trump, would take care of the nuclear “danger”, and Israel should stop aggressing Iran and possibly causing a nuclear WWIII? There was no more reason after 22 June to attack Iran. This was supposed to be good for Israel because the damage Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes on Israel was devastating. The truth of the damage has not (yet) come out in the western media. Also, Israel’s Air Defense System was made almost useless by Iranian drone attacks. Apparently, that’s why Israel agreed to a ceasefire, which was broken or not broken by both parties, depending whom to believe, but it may have been the reason why Trump exclaimed “They are stupid”, before he boarded the plane to the G7 farce in Canada. Iran also used her “homemade” Fattah-1, Iran’s first hypersonic missile which is claimed to be capable of penetrating advanced missile defenses. It has a range of 1,400 kilometers and is reported to reach speeds of Mach 14. Iran may have used a few Fattah-1 to cause considerable damage to Tel Aviv, Haifa, and possibly even Israeli nuclear sites. Image: Zardari in 2024 (CC BY 4.0) What if President Trump also spoke with Pakistan’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, a US-implant – if Israel uses nukes on Iran, Pakistan was free to “help” Iran, while Israel was also made aware of this possibility? Pakistan nor Israel is part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). What if Trump’s idea was indeed to avoid a nuclear WWIII with this maneuver; converting a potential atomic WWIII into a 10-day war? Full Stop. From 13 June, when the Israeli unprovoked, surprise-missile-attacked Iran, to 22 June 2025, when the US bombing of the three nuclear research sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, was done and over. Maybe that is also the reason, encouraged by Pakistani’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, why Trump was boasting lately and loudly that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Who knows? What if he will get it? Obama got it, before he did anything. Then he started, enhanced, and continued six new and existing wars; did not stop one. What if – has of course quite a few elements of speculation. But strategically, it would make sense. Wait and see what happens next on the Middle East / Western Asia front. Still unresolved is the Israeli genocide on Gaza and the apparently “never-ending” Ukraine [US-NATO] – Russia war. The former cannot even be categorized anymore as genocide, as a violation of International Law, an infraction of Human Rights – it is systematic, targeted killing, slaughter, ethnic cleansing, and outright expulsion from their land. The latter is Big Business for BlackRock, literally privatizing Ukraine, and the War industry, contributing mightily to the West’s GDP [a linear western invention to categorize world economies] – since destruction leads to construction, thus growth. What if – the West is doomed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have traded sideways since May—even as U.S. president Donald Trump’s crypto czar predicts a “big” July—after it surged through the first few months of Trump’s second presidency. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is up almost double from July last year, with predictions of “trillions and trillions” of dollars still on the sidelines helping to fuel sky-high bitcoin price bets.

More not for Donald Trump's global trade tariffs—something that some think could further boost the bitcoin price. "As M2 money supply begins to rise again, history suggests that a portion of this liquidity will flow into bitcoin and other digital assets," Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. Historically, the bitcoin price has tracked the M2 money supply, which is the Federal Reserve’s estimate of liquid assets, including cash, money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles such as money market funds. "If bitcoin continues to follow money supply growth, we could see $150,000 per coin before year end," Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, a crypto influencer who’s set to lead a new bitcoin acquisition company, wrote in an emailed note. The increase in the M2 money supply comes as Fed chair Jerome Powell continues to argue the case for keeping interest rates on hold.

More supply. “In effect we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs," Powell said this week during a conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Guardian newspaper, referring to Trump’s Liberation Day of trade tariffs that sent shockwaves through the global economy. "Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn’t overreact, in fact we didn’t react at all. We’re simply taking some time.” Last month, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September, despite a growing number of Fed officials arguing for rate cuts. “It’s clear that the Fed expects inflation to continue above target,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “That being the case, it sounds as if the Fed will only cut rates if the U.S. employment situation deteriorates significantly.”

Title: Crypto ETFs Are Diversifying. Can Demand Keep Up?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/crypto-etfs-are-diversifying-can-demand-keep-up/
Time Published: 2025-07-02T10:00:00Z

Numerous products have been awaiting approval by the SEC, and more, such as an index-based crypto ETF, are in development. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com What the world needs now is … another crypto ETF? That may be what asset managers are hoping. The list of would-be products seeking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval keeps growing. One of the latest proposed ETFs, from KraneShares, would invest across a considerable range of crypto assets. That fund, the KraneShares CF Large Cap Crypto Index ETF, for which the firm filed a registration statement for SEC review last Friday, would hold bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano and Hedera, according to the initial prospectus. And another firm, Bitwise, filed last week for three products that would expand its crypto coverage: The Bitwise Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF; Bitwise Aptos ETF; and Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. In the short history of the crypto ETF market, sales and assets have been dominated by a few players, most notably BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF represents nearly $75 billion. That hasn’t stopped companies from developing new ETFs, but there is a question about demand. “[For] your average investor, only 8% are concerned about adding crypto products to their portfolios,” said Stephen Caruso, associate director of wealth management at Cerulli Associates. The SEC has yet to approve a range of spot-price crypto ETFs. Regardless, the product space has branched out since the first bitcoin ETFs were approved in 2024. There are iterations of income-focused bitcoin ETFs, for example, and firms are preparing funds that offer staking capabilities, in the case of Solana and other crypto assets. There is increasing interest among retail investors in crypto ETFs broadly, and that can translate to opportunities for conversation with financial advisors, Caruso said. For example, about 20% of retail investors who haven’t worked with advisors before, but are strongly considering doing so, are interested in crypto ETFs, he said. Survey data show that demand for crypto ETFs varies by age and wealth: Competing for That Coin: “Crypto is not one-size-fits-all, and most of these digital assets have drastically different use cases and profiles … Ultimately, you want to understand why you are holding any digital asset and how it fits into your overall portfolio,” said Kevin Feig, founder of Walk You to Wealth and previously head of risk at crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. “More ETF options from multiple providers will likely lead to price competition and expense-ratio reductions, which is always a win for individual investors.” Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. Rich investors with large stock portfolios and capital gains get a tax bonus with 351 ETF exchanges. The fund enters into swap agreements with J.P. Morgan and tracks an index from MerQube. People are also more informed than ever about their ETF investments, per a Nasdaq report. The buy now, pay later business has a stigma that could hold back a proposed ETF focused on the market, one observer noted. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. The RIA’s investment manager recently launched a suite of nine products across a range of asset classes. Asset managers said active strategies are among their top choices for new products, per Morningstar. Most of the affected Vanguard index mutual funds and ETFs have co-managers, but several are now operating under single portfolio managers. A new ETF from several firms is banking on opportunities for active management amid a deregulatory White House agenda. The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

LAST UPDATE | 2 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney faces up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls, according to court documents. 77-year-old Gibney will appear before a Florida court in the US next week after he was arrested by US Marshals on foot of an Irish extradition warrant yesterday. Gardaí have been investigating fresh allegations that Gibney sexually abused multiple children in his care while working as a swimming coach in Ireland decades ago. Documents detail that the former coach was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. Taoiseach Micheál Martin, speaking in Japan this morning, said the arrest shows the importance of judicial cooperation with the United States. “I think we all listened to the podcast. I think it’s important that we have an agreement with the US. Gardaí have been working very diligently and in a detailed way, I have no doubt,” he said. Advertisement “We will await the next step now.” Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes yesterday afternoon. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge next Friday, 11 July, for a detention hearing. Gardaí said that they are aware of the arrest of a male aged in his 70s in the United States on the foot of an international warrant but would not be commenting “as this is currently a matter for the US authorities”. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. Now aged in his 70s, he was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction, preventing the DPP from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. The probe was then five years ago in the wake of the podcast series. The podcast centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by Gibney. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. The DPP would be free to seek Gibney’s extradition from the US if it were to proceed with charges.

Title: Crypto Presales Live News Today: Latest Opportunities & Updates (July 2)

Check out our Live Update Coverage on the Best Crypto Presales for July 2, 2025! Crypto presales are kicking gains day in and day out, motivated by impactful players like Mastercard, Visa, and the influx of new ETFs. These early-stage crypto projects are often significantly more profitable than established coins like Bitcoin. We’ll give you live updates on the trending presales, whale activities, projecting funding and development rounds, and critical alerts—everything you’ll need to get an edger. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the hottest presales, so keep refreshing! July 2, 2025 • 12:25 UTC The 15-day streak of net inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs finally came to an end Tuesday, when $342M flowed out. Blackrock’s flagship $IBIT ETF also saw its 15-day streak finish, though the fund saw net-zero flows. Evidence points to a pause in ETF demand, rather than an outright reversal, particularly as Bitcoin has seen steady support in ‘diamond hand’ holders, per a report from Glassnode. Bitcoin ETFs still hold a cumulative $128B in assets under management. The momentum is still bullish for institutional crypto demand; Ethereum spot ETFs saw $40.7M inflows the same day. The demand bodes well for cutting-edge crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the first and fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 with SVM integration. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) at the official presale page. July 2, 2025 • 11:22 UTC Stablecoins keep making headlines. Now, a Layer-1 blockchain (called Stable) powered by Tether ($USDT) as a gas token plans to fix many of the issues plaguing the crypto industry now: Stable can take stablecoins to a faster, cheaper, and more accessible experience for users. The documentation mentions sub-second finality for transactions, USDT0 integration, and full EVM compatibility. The project will also offer exclusive features for institutional users, which goes hand in hand with the recent asset manager interest in stablecoins. If you want to take part in the future of stablecoins, then a non-custodial wallet like Best Wallet is your best bet. It not only offers self-custody with MPC security but a growing decentralized ecosystem through Best Wallet Token. Visit the official Best Wallet token website to learn more about the project. July 2, 2025 • 10:19 UTC According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, public companies have now been buying more Bitcoin than ETFs for the third quarter in a row, with 131,000 $BTC purchases in Q2 2025, 18%, up from the previous quarter. Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, justified the disparity as pure profit-hunting: ‘The institutional buyer who is getting exposure to Bitcoin through the ETFs are not buying for the same reason as those public companies who are basically trying to accumulate Bitcoin to increase shareholder value at the end of the day.’ This explains why public companies now hold 4% of the total Bitcoin supply, or 885,000 $BTC, with Strategy leading the pack with 597,325. The growing adoption rate is likely to fuel Bitcoin in 2025 and beyond, along with side projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which show great long-term promise. As Bitcoin’s Layer-2 upgrade, Bitcoin Hyper promises to enhance Bitcoin’s infrastructure for faster transactions and lower costs. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) on the official presale page. July 2, 2025 • 09:19 UTC Unrealized profits among Bitcoiners reached over $1.2T, with Bitcoin’s total market cap at $2.14T. So more than half of that is HODLer profit, which is absolutely amazing to see. Glassnode’s ‘liveliness’ gauge is also going down, which again proves that holding is the dominant play among most Bitcoiners. What this means is that the market is more resilient than others would have you believe. Even through the Iran-Israel conflict, the bulls pushed $BTC back from under $100K to over $107K. And if there was ever a period to invest in up-and-coming cryptos (especially presales), it’s now. With so many ETFs coming, giants like JPMorgan jumping into the game, and Bitcoin reserves popping, it’s the best time to make some money. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which introduces the first-ever Bitcoin Layer-2 integrated with Solana’s Virtual Machine. This adds smart contract and dApp support to Bitcoin, aside from lower fees, higher-speed transactions, and a 2025 makeover that Bitcoin sorely needs. Check out Bitcoin Hyper’s presale page for more information on the project. July 2, 2025 • 08:22 UTC Fresh data for June reveals a significant boost for the crypto and Web3 sectors. Startups raised an impressive $1.15B across 140 deals, marking a 9% increase in deal count from May. The surge demonstrates growing investor confidence and a positive environment for decentralized technologies. Major players like Kalshi and cryptography firm Zama FHE secured significant investment rounds ($185M & $57M respectively), highlighting a focus on foundational innovation. Amidst this bullish trend, investors will start looking for strategic opportunities. One such project is the BTCBULL token ($BTCBULL), designed to directly benefit from $BTC’s ascent. With unique features like real Bitcoin airdrops for holders as $BTC hits key milestones, $BTCBULL offers a unique way to take part in the market’s upward trajectory. The $BTC is dropped into your Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets) when the targets are met. We’re seeing the crypto landscape mature rapidly, opening new avenues for savvy investors. Learn more about BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) on its presale page. July 2, 2025 • 07:26 UTC BlackRock’s $3.85B Bitcoin buying spree in June reflects renewed institutional appetite for crypto, which can only be good news for some of the best new presales. BlackRock’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which is expected to continue in July, indicates that traditional finance and crypto are coming together faster than expected. The trend is clear: traditional finance firms increasingly treat Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Heavyweights like Strategy, Tesla, Block, Coinbase, and financial giants such as BlackRock and JPMorgan are all stacking, marking increasing institutional acceptance of BTC. When huge organizations invest billions of dollars into Bitcoin, it can inspire confidence and trigger bullish trends ahead. New investors are looking to jump on the next big thing to blow in a bull run. Top crypto presales, like the degenerate new meme token TOKEN6900 and Snorter Token with its Solana trading bot, could offer just that. Find out more about the best new presales to buy in a Bitcoin bull run. July 2, 2025 • 07:25 UTC Bitget has just released their first zero-fee crypto card in partnership with Mastercard and Immersve. This announcement comes just two weeks after Mastercard partnered with Chainlink to enable on-chain crypto purchases, which would open roughly 3.5B cards to the blockchain. Scott Abrams, Executive Vice President, Global Partnerships at Mastercard, welcomes the partnership by stating: ‘At Mastercard, we’re committed to working with innovative companies like Bitget Wallet and Immersve to make crypto transactions simple, secure, and accessible at scale.’ Bitget currently reaches over 80 million users globally and supports over 130 blockchains, 20k distributed apps, and 1M tokens. The news is likely to not only bump Bitget’s stocks, but also support more user-friendly non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet, currently with its trademark $BEST token in presale.

Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars. Queue forms to the right! To all of the folks helping to make our Scandinavian sojourn amazing! We asked, you answered! Thanks so much to all the folks who shared good wishes and travel advice for our upcoming Scandinavian adventure: Stuart, Leah, Marjorie, DGH, and Roger. Thank you, thank you! Stuart: the Vasa Museum is one of our must-see sites! Gotland and Stumholmen are saved for our next trip. Leah: thanks for the sweater advice – we’re setting aside a budget for Bergen. And Chip might be booking a table at Bryggen Tracteursted as I write. DGH: Pending good weather, the Norse Folkemuseum and time to wander around Bygdøy are on the itinerary. Also, do we like cinnamon rolls? “Like” is such an understatement. WB Samson, got it! Roger: We are doing the Norway in a Nutshell with an overnight in Flåm. Since you and Leah both made note of the hiking/walking opportunities, we’ll see what we can fit in. We also have Frogner Park on the list! And, many thanks, always, to the steady contributors who help us keep the lights on and our spirits up: the good folks at S&F Investment Advisors, Wilson, Greg, William, William, Stephen, Brian, David, Doug, and Altaf.

The IPO was subscribed 16.69 times, powered by institutional interest signalling renewed investor appetite for large public offerings. Following a successful IPO, the company has fixed the issue price at ₹740. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) drove demand, with the reserved portion getting subscribed 55.47 times, while the non-institutional investor segment showed moderate interest with 9.99 times subscription. The quota reserved for retail investors was subscribed 1.41 times, with most opting for cut-off price bids. The employee category witnessed 5.71 times subscription, while existing shareholders (HDFC Bank) subscribed 4.26 times over their reserved quota. The overall issue size is ₹12,500 crore — compriseing fresh issue worth ₹2,500 crore and an offer-for-sale of up to ₹10,000 crore by HDFC Bank. The IPO is the largest in 2025 so far. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said after years of anticipation, HDB Financial Services is finally set to debut on the Indian stock exchanges, and early indicators point to a healthy 8–10 per cent listing gain, reflecting strong investor appetite. “The IPO garnered over ₹1.61 lakh crore in bids, underscoring massive institutional and retail interest. This makes HDB’s offering the second most subscribed IPO among ₹10,000+ crore issues, trailing only the record-breaking Tata Technologies listing. However, it did fall short of surpassing the all-time high ₹3 lakh crore+ subscription seen in the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO,” he added. “We believe the robust response signals market confidence in HDB’s business model, parentage (as an HDFC group company), and long-term growth potential in the NBFC space. If the listing meets expectations, it would reaffirm investor appetite for high-quality financial services plays, especially those backed by trusted legacy institutions,” he further said. In a recent interaction with businessline, G Ramesh, MD and CEO of HDB Financial Services, said the IPO proceeds would be used for on-lending, growth and strengthening the NBFC’s capital base. He clarified that HDB operates independent of HDFC Bank, not sharing business leads, office space or operational support. The company proposes using the fresh issue’s net proceeds to augment its Tier—I Capital base to meet its future capital requirements, including onward lending under any of its business verticals, i.e., Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. Further, a portion of the proceeds from the Fresh Issue will be used to meet Offer Expenses His remarks came amid the RBI’s 2024 draft norms proposing that only a single entity in a bank group can engage in a specific line of business.

Title: CBS Documentary Decrying Oligarchs Omits Notorious Lefty Billionaires

All Rights Reserved. Text to Speech A CBS News documentary blasted America’s supposed transition to a so-called “Gilded Age” of oligarchs to attack President Trump and the tech leaders who stood with him at his inauguration. As if CBS stood for Channeling Bernie Sanders. The problem: The documentary conveniently excluded any mention about the most notorious left-wing billionaires in U.S. politics that have used their cash to either try to buy elections or drastically overhaul U.S. policy over the years. Coincidence? We think not. The CBS documentary released June 28, “Is America in a New Gilded Age? Wealth, Power and Democracy,” relied mostly on whiny anti-capitalist commentary from radical talking heads like millionaires Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Clinton stooge Robert Reich to slam American capitalism as the culprit for Trump’s return to the White House, and by extension X owner Elon Musk’s tenure as the overseer of DOGE. “[A]fter the last presidential election, tensions over wealth, power and democracy have only heightened,” sensationalized CBS senior business and technology correspondent Jo Ling Kent. She admitted during a CBS Mornings appearance the day prior to her documentary’s release that her work was inspired by millionaire President Joe Biden’s farewell address warning about a rising “oligarchy.” See where this is going? Kent propped up Sanders and like-minded leftist legislators like fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who “began the Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies around the country to push back against what he argues is a corrupting influence of billionaires on U.S. politics.” But for all Kent and others’ grumbling over figures like Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Kent completely bypassed the ungodly political influence of other lefty billionaire titans who have built empires on the amount of political power they’ve gained during their lengthy careers. WATCH: CBS News Reporter Jo Ling Kent Hawks Her Anti-Billionaire Documentary on CBS Mornings (June 27, 2025). These include George Soros (and now his son Alex by extension) who has spewed $32 billion into his Open Society Foundations to foment racial strife, buoy climate change fanaticism, stoke LGBTQ political furor, push for open borders and undercut American sovereignty on the world stage. In addition, Soros spent hundreds of millions collectively on electing extremist political candidates and soft-on-crime prosecutors in order to shape politics to be the mirror reflection of his unhinged, anti-American worldview. His son Alex, who now controls his father's empire, openly promotes his enormous political pull with America's and the world's most powerful leaders on social media, including Biden. (Left to right: Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Reid Hoffman) Other high-profile billionaires missing from the documentary included Michael Bloomberg, who spent over $1 billion trying to buy the 2020 election, pledged another $1 billion at least to wipe out the U.S. coal industry, and spent $47 million during the 2024 election alone to elect Vice President Kamala Harris and help Democrats maintain control over the House; and deranged LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman who spent millions to elect Harris in 2024 and who personally bankrolled the highly politicized sexual abuse lawsuit against Trump brought by leftist E. Jean Carroll. Reid Hoffman was specifically part of a cohort of left-wing billionaires like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, philanthropist Laurene Powell-Jobs and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz who spent fortunes on secretive political machines to help Biden get elected in 2020. These weren’t mentioned by Kent either, which is even more telling given she also cited leftist anti-Trump author Andrea Bernstein who chirped, “What are you going to do if you’re wealthy and you have a lot of money? You’re going to put some of that into the political system to try to influence outcomes so that you can hang on to even more money. That’s the way the system works.” Ironic. To Kent’s credit, she did interview four guests who rebuffed the idea that America was reentering a Gilded Age (including Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley and Competitive Enterprise Institute President Kent Lassman), but these were largely dwarfed by another eight commentators who were just attacking and smearing the billionaires who have coalesced around Trump. For example, Kent tee’d up Dartmouth Sociology Professor Brooke Harrington, whose antagonistic term “broligarchs” she defined as rich people who “decide that they get to keep all the money and that they’re not going to pay any of their fair share of the costs of the society that made them prosperous.” Harrington then used this term to go after Musk and his businesses, but not other powerful billionaires who share her anti-capitalist views, such as Soros. Hypocritically, Kent didn’t bother to mention the enormous ESG asset manager giants that represent three of the top four institutional shareholders of her parent company Paramount Global and her liberal competitor networks at NBC, ABC, and CNN: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which manage over $26 trillion in assets. Sounds pretty oligarchy-adjacent, but apparently not for Kent. She had the audacity to cherry-pick Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post and Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of social media giant Twitter as examples of the inherent problems in business tycoons owning media. “One of the real dangers of great concentrated wealth is that not only does it exert influence politically, but it also exerts influence through its ownership of the media,” Reich complained to Kent. The CBS journalist followed up by referring back to how “in the Gilded Age, the ultra-wealthy could buy almost anything. And one prize for many was the means to influence public opinion.” Pretty sure the C-suites at BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were just tickled pink over that, eh Jo? “Owning a media company has always been viewed as an accessory for the very powerful,” pontificated Bloomberg Businessweek editor Brad Stone, who along with Kent apparently forgot that eco-activist Michael Bloomberg, worth $104 billion, owns his magazine. But Kent sure let him get in some digs at Bezos for daring to exercise his authority as The Post owner to shift the Opinion Page to a more free market position and ban the editorial board’s objectivity-wrecking tradition of endorsing political candidates. Riley, in one of his brief appearances in the documentary, slammed the hypocrisy of the left in fixating on billionaires when they seem to be oblivious to the special interests financing their own side. “Are people on the left complaining that other wealthy individuals decide to spend their money on electing people who want to go soft on criminals that are raising hell in low income communities?” He continued: “If you’re spending your money a certain way, you’re okay. If you’re spending it on free market ideas and principles — if you want lower taxes, if you want smaller government and so forth — somehow you are villainous.” Kent conceded that 80 billionaires donated to Harris’s campaign in 2024, while just over 50 billionaires did the same for Trump. But her documentary was clear in its implication that the only titans that matter to her and the CBS media giant are the ones that curry favor with Trump, while ignoring other, more dangerous political players on the left, including her own shareholder bosses.

Title: US dollar suffers worst start to a year since 1973 over Trump tariff concerns
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/01/business/us-dollar-suffers-worst-start-to-year-since-1973/

The US dollar suffered its worst first-half decline in more than 50 years as fears over President Trump’s tariff policies have driven down the world’s principal reserve currency. The greenback weakened 10.7% in the first six months of the year compared to a basket of currencies from major trading partners – the worst drop since 1973 when President Nixon stopped tying the dollar to the price of gold. But its decline could be part of Trump’s broader vision to devalue the dollar — an idea reportedly floated by Stephen Miran, recently appointed Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers in what has been dubbed the Mar-a-Lago Accord. Miran has denied this conspiracy in the past. A weaker dollar makes US exports much cheaper, and could aid Trump’s oft-stated goal of boosting manufacturing at home, as well as reducing the nation’s trade deficit, the thinking goes. When he was campaigning for a second term, an official in the first Trump administration told Politico that “currency revaluation is likely to be a priority” because of “the viewpoint that [an overvalued dollar] contributes to the trade deficit.” Trump has not weighed in on the speculation about devaluing the dollar. “President Trump has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency,” White House press spokesman Kush Desai told The Post on Tuesday. “Ten-year Treasury yields rallying down nearly 40 basis points since Inauguration Day, four consecutive expectation-beating inflation reports, and the trillions in historic investment commitments that have poured into the United States since Election Day are all indicative of the confidence that investors and markets continue to have in our economy and currency.” But many experts claim Trump’s hefty tariffs are putting pressure on the dollar and forcing global investors to rethink their ties to the currency. “Trump is definitely playing with fire,“ Stephen Miller, a consultant for GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Corp. in Australia, told Bloomberg. While a weaker dollar should theoretically help US exporters, there’s still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to global trade because of the Trump administration’s ongoing negotiations with key nations, which are staring down a fast-approaching July 9 deadline. The dollar’s fall comes after it soared on Trump’s re-election win and peaked in mid-January on hopes he would bring a pro-growth mindset to the White House. But in April, Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement revealed tariffs that were much stiffer than analysts and economists had predicted, spurring a broad shift away from US investments. “Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said in the company’s most recent forecast. But the drop in confidence in the US dollar, which is typically seen as a safe haven asset, is concerning – and could worsen with a rise in government debt, according to Rieder. Trump’s massive budget bill, which is projected to add $3 trillion in national debt, narrowly squeaked through the Senate on Tuesday. It awaits final approval in the House. The concerns over higher inflation and debt have have pushed long-term Treasury yields lower. The 10-year yield started near 5% this year and has steadily fallen, reaching 4.267% on Tuesday. “I think we’re going to continue to have this higher pressure on the low end of the yield curve because we haven’t really dealt anything away with the deficit or inflation for that matter. In fact, there’s more risk now than anything,” Ben Emons, founder of FedWatch Advisors, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday. “I do think it’s related to Treasuries, that if Treasuries get more under pressure, the dollar will get weaker.” Advertisement

Title: Live From ETHCC Robinhood Launches Tokenized OpenAI Access

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Robinhood is making significant headlines live from ETHcc in France (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty ... More Images) At the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Cannes this week, I’ve been keynoting, speaking on panels, networking, and diving deep into topics like decentralized AI and next-gen blockchains. One announcement that truly stood out was Robinhood’s bold leap forward. They’re evolving from a retail brokerage into a next-gen financial super app—with blockchain at the core. Tokenized Nvidia shares? That’s the kind of real-world utility that actually moves the needle. From tokenizing over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs to building its own Layer 2 blockchain, Robinhood is positioning itself at the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance. The implications could be transformative, not only for the company but for the future of digital assets globally. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, unveiled the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies – like SpaceX —offered exclusively to eligible customers in the European Union. These digital assets are initially issued on Arbitrum, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution known for speed and low fees. Over time, Robinhood plans to migrate its offerings to a proprietary blockchain, currently in development. Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, announcing the launch of tokenized stocks for private companies ... More like SpaceX and OpenAI, available to European Union customers. This announcement wasn’t just a headline moment—it marked the beginning of a broader integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Robinhood’s move into tokenization is designed to provide 24/5 access to over 200 U.S. stocks and ETFs with no commissions, no added spreads, dividend support, and crypto wallet compatibility. In addition, Robinhood shared that tokenized shares of select privately held companies—most notably OpenAI (see below for updates) and SpaceX—will be made available to eligible EU customers later this summer, expanding access to high-profile, previously inaccessible private equity. The timing is no accident. Robinhood recently secured new licenses in Europe, and unveiling this initiative at ETHCC underscores its ambitions to expand globally and deepen its footprint in the blockchain space. The regulatory contrast between regions is sharp. While U.S. customers are now gaining access to crypto staking (starting with Ethereum and Solana), European users are unlocking access to tokenized public and private equities. It’s a bold move that positions the EU as the first major market to experience tokenized real-world assets at scale, through a consumer-facing platform. The news triggered a powerful market response: Robinhood’s shares surged to a fresh all‑time high, climbing 11–13% on the day, reflecting investor confidence in this strategic pivot and the market’s enthusiasm for bringing high-value assets onchain. Robinhood’s rollout of tokenized shares in Europe took a dramatic turn when OpenAI publicly disavowed any involvement. While Robinhood discussed their ability to offer users fractional exposure to companies like OpenAI and SpaceX through blockchain-wrapped assets, OpenAI made it clear: no partnership, no equity transfer, no endorsement. It’s the financial equivalent of putting a company’s logo on a t-shirt and selling it—without ever talking to the brand. This clash underscores a growing tension: platforms are racing to tokenize access, while companies are scrambling to retain control of their cap tables. Robinhood argues this is about unlocking opportunity through indirect exposure via special purpose vehicles. But OpenAI’s reaction is a reminder that not all “access” is created equal—especially when real ownership isn’t part of the equation. This move mirrors a similar announcement from Republic earlier in the week, yet the mechanics differ substantially. Republic issues equity‑backed Digital Asset Receipts (DARTs), representing true on‑chain ownership of shares held in trusts or SPVs. This approach is pure “on-chain equity”—combining legal rights with digital portability. The difference in tokenization of stocks between Robinhood and Republic By contrast, Robinhood’s offering appears to be more like synthetic exposure or broker‑held tokens. They grant economic participation—such as dividend gains and tradability—without conferring legal shareholder status. In short, Republic’s approach is “on‑chain equity,” while Robinhood’s may be closer to “on‑chain access.” Different infrastructural models, same goal: unlocking elite investment opportunities via blockchain. Tokenized equities are just the beginning. Robinhood has layered in multiple crypto and blockchain features across its platforms. Following its completion of the Bitstamp acquisition, EU users will soon gain access to perpetual futures with up to 3x leverage—a tool typically favored by advanced traders. These derivatives are slated to launch later this summer. In the US, Robinhood has introduced crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana, aligning with regulatory guidance clarifying staking doesn't qualify as a security. Eligible users in approved states can now earn yield directly within Robinhood’s platform. Additional user incentives include a 1–2% bonus on transferred crypto deposits, upcoming cashback-to-crypto conversion via the Robinhood Gold credit card, and advanced tax‑lot selection tools—giving retail traders greater control over capital gains and reporting. Robinhood is achieving what few other platforms can: operationalizing tokenized equity for the masses within a regulated, mobile‑first environment. Major financial players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs explore similar blockchain models behind the scenes, but Robinhood is delivering real‑world asset tokenization directly to mainstream retail users. Industry estimates suggest tokenized assets could reach $13.55 trillion by 2030. With licenses secured and a product roadmap underway, Robinhood is racing against competitors like Coinbase, Kraken, and Republic to define how riders experience tokenized finance. Bankless co‑founder David Hoffman commented that Robinhood—armed with regulatory approval and pre‑IPO access—is well‑positioned to leapfrog crypto‑native platforms in this race. Robinhood’s long-term vision extends well beyond tokenized stocks. The company is stacking in features like an AI‑driven investing assistant (Cortex), smart order routing across liquidity pools, advanced mobile charting, and eventually a full-fledged Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 optimized for real‑world asset tokenization. This next-gen blockchain infrastructure is designed for 24/7 trading, cross-chain asset bridging, and self‑custody—redefining retail access in the age of TradFi meets DeFi. Robinhood’s ETHCC 2025 announcements mark a pivotal moment in digital finance, not just product innovation. By bringing tokenized private equity like SpaceX into its mobile app, layering in staking and perpetual futures, and building blockchain infrastructure, Robinhood is staking a claim as a frontrunner in the financial super app space. As tokenized investing becomes a tangible reality for millions, the lines between centralized brokerages and decentralized protocols are blurring—setting a high bar for the next generation of financial platforms.

FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney has been arrested by US authorities in Florida this afternoon. He was taken into custody by US Marshals on foot of an Irish extradition warrant and is being detained pending a court appearance. Gardaí have been investigating fresh allegations that Gibney sexually abused multiple children in his care while working as a swimming coach in Ireland decades ago. The investigation was reopened in 2020 after several individuals made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’, prompting a specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau to begin a detailed inquiry. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. In a statement today, gardaí said that they are”aware of the arrest of a male aged in his 70s in the United States” on the foot of an Irish international arrest warrant. “As this is currently a matter for the US authorities, An Garda Síochána will not be commenting further at this time,” a spokesperson said. Advertisement Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. Now aged in his 70s, he was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993. However, the charges of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge were dropped in 1994 after he secured an injunction in the High Court preventing the DPP from prosecuting him. Gibney left Ireland and moved to Scotland where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. This investigation did not result in a prosecution. In 2020, the ‘Where is George Gibney?’ podcast, a ten-part investigative series produced by BBC Sounds and Second Captains, gave an in-depth at look the circumstances and child abuse accusations surrounding Gibney. The series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by Gibney, and it became one of the most impactful pieces of journalism of recent years – many new survivors came forward to tell their story, and gardaí commenced a new investigation after the podcast was broadcast. An appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. A number of alleged victims did come forward with allegations. The DPP would be free to seek Gibney’s extradition from the US if it was to proceed with charges. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

UniCredit links investment certificate to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, ensuring capital protection for clients. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. European banking behemoth UniCredit is entering the crypto arena with a structured product tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on July 1, citing an internal memo. Under the plan, UniCredit will offer professional clients a five-year, U.S. dollar-denominated investment certificate linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The product will guarantee 100% capital protection at maturity. BlackRock launched its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe in March, listing under the ticker “IB1T” on Euronext Paris and Xetra, and “BTCN” on Euronext Amsterdam. The firm’s U.S.-listed IBIT fund has amassed over $73 billion in assets under management, making it the most successful crypto-linked financial product by investment capital to date. The move comes amid a sweeping embrace of digital assets by European banks, enabled by the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory regime becoming effective across the bloc. Deutsche Bank last week confirmed it will launch institutional crypto custody services in 2026. It follows a June announcement that the lender is also exploring stablecoin issuance and blockchain payment projects in step with MiCA guidelines. Simultaneously, Germany’s Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, comprising local savings banks with over 50 million customers, is preparing to roll out regulated crypto trading access for its retail clients by summer 2026, offering assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Meanwhile, Deutsche Boerse’s custody arm, Clearstream, began providing institutional clients with Bitcoin and Ethereum settlement and custody services earlier this year. France’s Societe Generale is also continuing its expansion into digital finance and launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD CoinVertible, via its SG-FORGE subsidiary this month.dy. Spain’s BBVA, commonly cautious on crypto, now advises affluent clients to hold 3%–7% of their portfolios in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The lender has also secured approval to launch crypto trading services. However, European regulators remain cautious. ECB Governor Fabio Panetta recently reiterated concerns of reputational risks from crypto services inside regulated banks and stressed the need to manage investor expectations and consider a digital euro to preserve confidence in financial systems.

Title: Trump Is Setting the U.S. Economy Up for Another Great Financial Crisis

Time Published: 2025-07-01T18:00:00Z

This story was originally published in Truthout. The financial system of the United States has always been prone to instability and crises. Now, however, under the new Trump administration, which is pushing for major cuts in regulation, including in the cryptocurrency sector in which the Trump family has a major financial stake, the financial system has become more vulnerable than ever, posing serious risks to the wider economy. Of course, this matters very little to Donald Trump, his family, and his billionaire friends. For Trump, the actual meaning of ​“America First” is ​“self-enrichment.” In the interview that follows, progressive economist Gerald Epstein, a leading expert in finance and banking, talks about the changing nature of the U.S. finance system under Trump 2.0. He argues that Trump is turning the entire financial system into ​“a Wild West of unregulated institutions and markets,” thus potentially setting the stage for a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. Epstein is professor of economics and co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of Busting the Bankers’ Club: Finance for the Rest of Us. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. C.J. Polychroniou: The U.S. financial landscape is always evolving, but not necessarily in a desirable direction. Financial technology (fintech), artificial intelligence (AI), the shadow banking system, and deregulation are raising concerns about financial instability and even warnings of another financial crisis. Indeed, just recently, even The Economist—a champion of free markets, deregulation, and financialization — ran an article titled, ​“American finance, always unique, is now uniquely dangerous.” Can you briefly address the evolving nature of the U.S. financial system since the 2007-08 financial crisis and whether concerns about an increase in financial stability risks are valid? Gerald Epstein: The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009 hurt millions of Americans and was costly to countless others elsewhere. Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and saw public services — such as resources for schools, health care, and subsidized child care — experience major cuts. As I show in Busting the Bankers’ Club: Finance for the Rest of Us, the roots of the GFC stem from radical financial deregulation by both Democratic and Republican administrations, and also joined by European governments, that permitted megabanks and their top personnel to take on huge risks and win large payoffs. And when the markets collapsed, they were bailed out by central banks and governments without penalty to themselves or their banks. More specifically, bankers and other operatives in the financial system, such as credit rating agencies, were able to profit from massive conflicts of interest; huge and often hidden levels of debt (leverage); deliberately overly complex and opaque financial products that their customers, and often themselves, did not understand; large-scale fraud and corruption that went largely unpunished; and, in the end, massive government bailouts that saved them and their institutions but came at the expense of the taxpayers and the overall economy, as the work of the late James Crotty has shown. The financial reform laws, in the United States known as Dodd-Frank, were hard-fought but ended up with only moderate improvements in the financial regulations. These reforms promised to make banking less risky by reducing leverage and by increasing bank capital and liquidity; they also promised to make banking activities less opaque by increasing regulatory monitoring of the largest banks. But the effectiveness of these rules eroded over time. This erosion occurred partly because, under Trump 1.0, they were rolled back and weakened in some important respects. And the rules became less effective because the financial markets innovated around them. These changes were well described in the Economist article and included increasing the size of the less regulated areas, increasing the roles of private credit, including asset management firms like BlackRock, hedge funds, and private equity funds, thereby increasing the financial footprint of relatively unregulated credit institutions. Of course, none of this was inevitable. Had there been governments serious about regulating finance in the U.S. and in Europe, they could have strengthened their restrictions, but they had no such interest in doing so. On the contrary, when there was a banking crisis in 2022 (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, USB, etc.), the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury bailed out all of their depositors and some of their debt holders and shareholders. This gave a clear sense to these markets that they could keep growing. All of these trends have now gotten much, much worse because of the actions of Trump 2.0. The Trump administration and the Republican Congress with the help of the Supreme Court and some Democrats are trying to take down almost the entire edifice of financial regulation, including trying to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, place finance-friendly regulators in all the key regulatory agencies, and mostly commit themselves to a free-for-all approach to regulation. The result is increasingly one of conflicts of interest, artificially created complexity and opaqueness, allowing large increases in debt (leverage) throughout the system and massive increases in the potential for fraud and corruption. In other words, they are turning the entire financial system into a ​“shadow” financial system, that is a system that is largely unmonitored and unregulated, a system of ​“private credit,” a Wild West of unregulated institutions and markets. Polychroniou: The private credit market has exploded in recent years, challenging the process of traditional lending. Does the growth of private credit in itself pose a risk to financial system stability? Epstein: As Lenore Palladino and Harrison Karlewicz among others have shown, there has been a massive growth of ​“private credit” as a share of the total financial market assets in recent years. As they point out, private funds have approximately tripled in size in the last decade to $26 trillion in gross assets (compared to the $23 trillion in the U.S. commercial banking industry). These funds include pension funds and insurance company assets which are now increasingly managed by private credit firms such as asset management firms with relatively less regulatory oversight. But as I suggested, even the megabanks themselves are finding many ways to avoid much oversight in this new era of deregulation. Even though The Economist issue you lead with points to some of these dangers, their warnings are almost always balanced off by suggesting that these financial ​“innovations” offer benefits to the clients and to the overall economy. But in fact, in most cases, there is little evidence for these benefits. Highly managed asset portfolios do worse than index funds that simply purchase a share of the whole (or a segment of) the financial markets; and one does not need private credit institutions to make these standard investments. More complex investments tend to have higher fees, less liquidity, more risk. Polychroniou: Trump and congressional Republicans, with the help of a number of key Democrats, are pushing legislation to make cryptocurrencies occupy a central position in the U.S. financial system. What problems will this create for the economy? Epstein: The poster child for the even more extreme risks coming down the road is the gigantic push being made now by Donald Trump, his family and a whole phalanx of billionaires, Republican politicians, and some Democrats. They want to place cryptocurrencies and assets at the center of the financial system and make tech capitalists such as Elon Musk and Trump himself the kingpins of the financial system. They also aim to transform tech firms into money and credit creators that will be able to print money — like the Federal Reserve and the banks — but will have virtually none of the regulation. In this way, these tech billionaires and Trump family members will be able to privatize the U.S. dollar and the U.S. financial system with virtually no oversight. The key legislative initiatives here are the so-called GENIUS Act, which was just passed by the Senate, and the CLARITY Act, which is set to go to the House of Representatives. Senate passage of the GENIUS Act on June 18, with 18 Democrats voting for it, illustrates the massive spending by cryptocurrency companies and lobbyists, first in primary elections to defeat anti-crypto Democrats, and then in the November election to elect pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats. We can expect them to spend even more in the 2026 election to push out sensible crypto-questioning Democrats. Polychroniou: Overall, Trump’s reckless policies are plunging the U.S economy into chaos and are negatively impacting global economies. Could they trigger a financial crisis? Epstein: Yes. These policies, and especially the cryptocurrency push, are very dangerous. And that was a point made implicitly by the Economist article. But there is an important point that is missed here: Even short of a financial crisis, these highly speculative, risky, exploitative, and fraud-ridden financial markets hurt workers, families, and communities on a daily basis. As Juan Montecino and I showed in our article, ​“Overcharged: The High Cost of High Finance,” this kind of financial system fails to provide the financial services that workers, small businesses, households, and communities need. Yes, there are the multitrillion-dollar costs of financial crises caused by such financial systems, but there is the huge cost of misallocation of human and financial resources in a speculative, wasteful, destructive, financial economy. Polychroniou: What can be done to prevent the implementation of the reckless finance reform policies undertaken by the Trump administration? Epstein: We have to defeat Trumpism, the leading edge of this crony financialized capitalism, as well as the neoliberal Democratic opportunists who support and benefit from these policies. C.J.

Terry Savage, Tribune Content Agency, Terry Savage Posted 07/01/2025 at 1:28 pm EST Wall Street has a new target. With nearly $9 trillion in assets, 401(k) plans have caught the eye of Wall Street insiders. For years, they have been investing in “private equity” and venture capital deals. They find small, promising companies and lend their capital and management expertise — hoping to sell out in the public stock markets for huge gains. But in recent years, there has been little opportunity for these insiders to cash in and realize profits to be distributed back to their investors. A slowing market for initial public offerings (IPOs) means many are “stuck” in their deals, with little liquidity. Stock market volatility, higher interest rates, and a preference for large tech companies have muted deal activity, and the chance to redeploy profits (and fees) into new deals. Those who need to sell out of these deals must take a huge discount because there are so few buyers. Ordinary investors aren’t aware of this dire situation for Wall Street tycoons, since individuals have been largely prohibited from investing in private equity, unless they can demonstrate they have significant risk capital and financial assets outside the value of their home. That’s all about to change. Now Wall Street is looking to let ordinary investor get in on these deals — by including them as investment options inside their 401k) plans. And they’re getting help from the current administration. The SEC’s Office of the Investor Advocate has named the inclusion of private equity and other alternatives in retirement plans as a top policy priority for 2026. Is the SEC protecting the small investor here, or the big boy investors who are stuck in their deals? Major asset managers like BlackRock are preparing to launch target-date funds for 401(k)s with a 5%–20% allocation to private investments, including PE and private credit, starting in 2026. But such investments come with concerns for plan sponsors, who are supposed to act as fiduciaries. In 2020 the Labor Department, which regulates retirement plans, cautiously opened the door to small amounts of private investments in 401(k) plans, while warning about valuation and liquidity risks. That is a sophisticated way of saying that no one really knows what these investments are worth — until they try to sell out and get their cash back. As private equity, there is — by definition — no public market to set prices for all to see. Even worse, there may be no buyers, leaving investors stuck. Huge public pension funds started investing in private equity many years ago, expecting easy and profitable liquidation of these assets in 6-10 years — just when they’d need the cash to pay our promised pensions. Now they’re scrambling to increase liquidity by selling other assets. Recent data show that the pace of private equity exits has fallen to a two-year low. And PE funds haven’t been making distributions to their pension fund investors, amid this “exit drought." Inside Wall Street, private equity is being compared to a “roach motel” — easy to get into, and almost impossible to get out! Now they are opening the doors of that roach motel to YOU via your retirement plan. And you’re supposed to be grateful for this unprecedented opportunity. You may soon find these private equity deals inside a target-date retirement plan, or as stand-alone investment choices offered by prestigious Wall Street firms. My advice is: Don’t take the bait. Investment firms are required to warn that past returns are no guarantee of future performance. That’s never been more true than today, despite huge wins in the past. Now the world of private equity is searching for liquidity and eyeing the unsuspecting trillions of dollars in company retirement plans. If you step into this roach motel, they won’t “leave the light on for ya.” And that’s The Savage Truth.

Title: UN report lists companies complicit in Israel’s ‘genocide’: Who are they?

UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese has issued a report naming several US giants among companies aiding Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza. Companies from other countries – from China to Mexico – are also named. The United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) has released a new report mapping the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza, in breach of international law. Francesca Albanese’s latest report, which is scheduled to be presented at a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, names 48 corporate actors, including United States tech giants Microsoft, Alphabet Inc. – Google’s parent company – and Amazon. A database of more than 1000 corporate entities was also put together as part of the investigation. “[Israel’s] forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely,” the report said. “Companies are no longer merely implicated in occupation – they may be embedded in an economy of genocide,” it said, in a reference to Israel’s ongoing assault on the Gaza Strip. In an expert opinion last year, Albanese said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe Israel was committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave. The report stated that its findings illustrate “why Israel’s genocide continues”. “Because it is lucrative for many,” it said. Israel’s procurement of F-35 fighter jets is part of the world’s largest arms procurement programme, relying on at least 1,600 companies across eight nations. It is led by US-based Lockheed Martin, but F-35 components are constructed globally. Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A is listed as a main contributor in the military sector, while Japan’s FANUC Corporation provides robotic machinery for weapons production lines. The tech sector, meanwhile, has enabled the collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, “supporting Israel’s discriminatory permit regime”, the report said. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon grant Israel “virtually government-wide access to their cloud and AI technologies”, enhancing its data processing and surveillance capacities. The US tech company IBM has also been responsible for training military and intelligence personnel, as well as managing the central database of Israel’s Population, Immigration and Borders Authority (PIBA) that stores the biometric data of Palestinians, the report said. It found US software platform Palantir Technologies expanded its support to the Israeli military since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023. The report said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe the company provided automatic predictive policing technology used for automated decision-making in the battlefield, to process data and generate lists of targets including through artificial intelligence systems like “Lavender”, “Gospel” and “Where’s Daddy?” The report also lists several companies developing civilian technologies that serve as “dual-use tools” for Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. These include Caterpillar, Leonardo-owned Rada Electronic Industries, South Korea’s HD Hyundai and Sweden’s Volvo Group, which provide heavy machinery for home demolitions and the development of illegal settlements in the West Bank. Rental platforms Booking and Airbnb also aid illegal settlements by listing properties and hotel rooms in Israeli-occupied territory. The report named the US’s Drummond Company and Switzerland’s Glencore as the primary suppliers of coal for electricity to Israel, originating primarily from Colombia. In the agriculture sector, Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which benefits from land seized from Palestinians in Israel’s illegal outposts. Netafim, a company providing drip irrigation technology that is 80-percent owned by Mexico’s Orbia Advance Corporation, provides infrastructure to exploit water resources in the occupied West Bank. Treasury bonds have also played a critical role in funding the ongoing war on Gaza, according to the report, with some of the world’s largest banks, including France’s BNP Paribas and the UK’s Barclays, listed as having stepped in to allow Israel to contain the interest rate premium despite a credit downgrade. The report identified US multinational investment companies BlackRock and Vanguard as the main investors behind several listed companies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is listed as the second largest institutional investor in Palantir (8.6 percent), Microsoft (7.8 percent), Amazon (6.6 percent), Alphabet (6.6 percent) and IBM (8.6 per cent), and the third largest in Lockheed Martin (7.2 percent) and Caterpillar (7.5 percent). Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is the largest institutional investor in Caterpillar (9.8 percent), Chevron (8.9 percent) and Palantir (9.1 percent), and the second largest in Lockheed Martin (9.2 percent) and Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems (2 percent). The report states that “colonial endeavours and their associated genocides have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector.” Israel’s expansion on Palestinian land is one example of “colonial racial capitalism”, where corporate entities profit from an illegal occupation. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, “entities that previously enabled and profited from Palestinian elimination and erasure within the economy of occupation, instead of disengaging are now involved in the economy of genocide,” the report said. For foreign arms companies, the war has been a lucrative venture. Israel’s military spending from 2023 to 2024 surged 65 percent, amounting to $46.5bn – one of the highest per capita worldwide. Several entities listed on the exchange market – particularly in the arms, tech and infrastructure sectors – have seen their profits rise since October 2023. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also rose an unprecedented 179 percent, adding $157.9bn in market value. Global insurance companies, including Allianz and AXA, invested large sums in shares and bonds linked to Israel’s occupation, the report said, partly as capital reserves but primarily to generate returns. Booking and Airbnb also continue to profit from rentals in Israeli-occupied land. Airbnb briefly delisted properties on illegal settlements in 2018 but later reverted to donating profits from such listings to humanitarian causes, a practice the report referred to as “humanitarian-washing”. According to Albanese’s report, yes. Corporate entities are under an obligation to avoid violating human rights through direct action or in their business partnerships. States have the primary responsibility to ensure that corporate entities respect human rights and must prevent, investigate and punish abuses by private actors. However, corporations must respect human rights even if the state where they operate does not. A company must therefore assess whether activities or relationships throughout its supply chain risk causing human rights violations or contributing to them, according to the report. The failure to act in line with international law may result in criminal liability. Individual executives can be held criminally liable, including before international courts. The report called on companies to divest from all activities linked to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, which is illegal under international law. In July 2024, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion ruling that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem should come to an end “as rapidly as possible”. In light of this advisory opinion, the UN General Assembly demanded that Israel bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory by September 2025. Albanese’s report said the ICJ’s ruling “effectively qualifies the occupation as an act of aggression … Consequently, any dealings that support or sustain the occupation and its associated apparatus may amount to complicity in an international crime under the Rome Statute. “States must not provide aid or assistance or enter into economic or trade dealings, and must take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that would assist in maintaining the illegal situation created by Israel in the oPt.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Why The Pro-Crypto SEC Is Exploring Tokenized IPOs

ByChristopher Perkins ByChristopher Perkins, Contributor. UNITED STATES - JUNE 3: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins testifies during the Senate Appropriations ... More Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government hearing titled "A Review of the President's FY2026 Budget Request for the Securities and Exchange Commission," in Dirksen building on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Public markets are springing back to life. The crypto industry, considering its reputation for disrupting the legacy system, is actually breathing life back into it. The exuberance of the oversubscribed Circle ($CRCL) IPO, whose share price skyrocketed nearly 10x after its public debut, has catalyzed excitement for the crypto companies across Wall Street. It’s no surprise that Gemini, FalconX, and Bullish are among the crypto firms preparing for IPOs of their own. There’s a simultaneous flurry of special purpose acquisition companies and reverse mergers of public companies rushing to the market, especially those busily acquiring crypto assets on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, podcaster Eleanor Terrett reported the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring ways to streamline crypto exchange-traded fund applications to forgo the required 19b-4 filing. When it comes to crypto companies, public markets are open for business. Despite this recent glimmer of hope, injected by crypto bull market excitement, overall public companies are struggling. In his 2024 letter to shareholders, JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said, “Our public markets have been shrinking dramatically, which I do not believe is a good thing. The number of public companies has gone from 7,300 in 1996 to 4,000 today – it should be 15,000 today.” Blaming overly zealous regulation, Dimon continued: “Regulations should encourage, rather than discourage, companies to go public.” In 2024, 176 companies in the U.S. raised a mere $33 billion through their IPOs. Just 20 years prior, in 2004, $43 million was raised across 233 companies. With the exception of the COVID anomalies of 2020-2021, where an unprecedented level of liquidity was injected into markets, the IPO market has been anemic at best. So far, in 2025, crypto companies (and companies investing in crypto) are proving to be the most resilient and adaptable players in an otherwise lethargic public market. This is not the first time that Wall Street has been swept up in blockchain mania. In 2017, Long Island Ice Tea Corp. rebranded to “Long Blockchain Corp.” and saw its share price surge 200%. The blockchain bubble eventually burst and the crypto industry entered a protracted bear market. While skeptics will suggest that this cycle is no different, there is a bigger change brewing beneath these headlines that could have an enduring impact on public markets. This is the metamorphosis of market structure itself--now made possible by integrating blockchain technology--and supported by a pro-crypto SEC. It’s expensive to go public. To IPO, companies work with investment bankers to build a syndicate of buyers and set an opening price. Underwriting fees can cost up to 7% of funds raised. Add compliance, audit and legal costs, and fees to go public typically reach into the millions of dollars. The costs do not stop there. It’s also expensive to stay public. Since a string of high profile accounting scandals, including Enron, rocked markets in the early 2000s, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 materially increased the ongoing compliance and reporting burden for public companies. According to a Harvard study in 2022, audit fees alone cost public companies an average of over $2 million per year. Former SEC Chair Gensler did not help matters. His relentless focus on enforcement actions, in addition to tighter disclosure rules on a range of corporate issues like climate change, added to the burden—and cost—of being public. It’s no surprise that companies are staying private. According to Blackrock, 81% of companies with over $100 million in revenue are privately held in the U.S. The issue with private markets is that they are indeed private, depriving ordinary people from investing in the most exciting and innovative companies. The new SEC is poised to address this. Last month at the Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Tokenization, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins noted, “A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” When it comes to issuance, direct listings on blockchains could be the answer. Unlike traditional IPOs, which are supported by investment bank middlemen, direct listing is a form of going public that allows companies to issue shares directly and let market forces set the price. Blockchains are an obvious technology to support transfer agents, which are organizations that manage company stockholder records. By wrapping securities as tokens and issuing them on blockchains, anyone in the world with an internet connection could theoretically buy them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The SEC would need to allow this in order for it to become the norm. Last month, the Solana Policy Institute, along with a consortium of crypto leaders, proposed a direct listing framework to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Under this proposed model, issuers could issue “their token shares” directly on blockchains. Disclosures and registration would remain, and a series of exemptions from current regulations would be needed for the proposal to work. The markets seem to be ready. While memecoins, like dogecoin ($DOGE), have no intrinsic value or utility, there has been abundance of willing buyers. Last year, the combined market capitalization of memecoins soared to a whopping $140 billion . Robinhood ($HOOD) seems to think that those buyers would remain if it offered tokenized equities. This week it announced 24 hour-a-day stock trading for customers in Europe, supported by its own blockchain. If tokenized equity direct listings are allowed, this wouldn’t be the first time the SEC helped an innovative new product get off the ground. Equity tokens could be the new ETFs. In the 1990s, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden pushed a reluctant SEC staff to allow ETFs in the United States. By “wrapping” previously inaccessible (and, at times, sophisticated) assets as a security, retail investors could trade ETFs seamlessly from their brokerage account. By 2024, ETFs had grown to become a $13 trillion industry. When Breeden championed innovation through the launch of ETFs, he had an astute Chief of Staff. His name was Paul Atkins. It may be no coincidence that Atkins was sworn in as the new SEC chairman in April, nominated by the pro-bitcoin President Donald Trump. It remains to be seen whether this approach to fintech regulation will revive public markets.

Title: Is Crypto Ready for Q-Day?

Are you ready for Q-Day? Do you even know what Q-Day is? If you don't, you're sleepwalking into a digital apocalypse that's not coming—it's already here. Q-Day isn't some distant theoretical event. It's the moment quantum computing shatters every lock, breaks every code, and renders every secret naked. While your most powerful supercomputer would need billions of years to crack modern encryption that currently secures crypto wallets, blockchains, digital banking assets, and WhatsApp chats, a quantum computer could do it over lunch. Every "secure" transaction, every "private" communication, every "protected" system becomes an open book. As Jay Gambetta, Vice President of IBM Quantum, warns: "The quantum threat isn't coming—it's here. Nation-states are harvesting encrypted data TODAY, betting they'll decrypt it tomorrow. If you're not quantum-safe now, you're already compromised." Let me be brutally clear: whether Q-Day arrives in one year, two years, or five years is completely irrelevant. Why? Because of "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks. Right now, as you read this, malicious nation states and criminal actors are vacuuming up encrypted data including medical records, financial transactions, state secrets, and your personal communications. They can't read it today, but they're betting on quantum to unlock it tomorrow. Computer scientist Deborah Frincke from Sandia National Laboratories doesn't mince words: "Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption. Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing commands to shut down networks, influence the energy grid, or create financial disruption." In May 2025, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion under management, did something unprecedented. They added quantum computing as a critical risk warning to their Bitcoin ETF filing, warning that quantum advances could "undermine the viability" of cryptographic algorithms used not just in Bitcoin but across the entire global tech stack. Researchers warn that 4 million bitcoin—roughly 25% of all usable BTC—could be stolen once quantum computers advance enough to break their encryption. Leading quantum expert. It's not just Bitcoin. Ethereum and most blockchains today rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and quantum will shatter that. Experts predict that Q-Day will come within the next five-to-seven years, but it could be sooner. Quantum is coming for bitcoin like meteors came for the dinosaurs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has already proposed emergency hard-fork solutions for when quantum computers crack Ethereum accounts. The Ethereum blockchain would need to be paused for an unknown time until it's restored to a new quantum-resistant blockchain, a process that could take years. Behind closed doors at private crypto conferences, influential cryptographers and business leaders are concerned about a potential catastrophe where a computer strong enough to reverse engineer wallets' private keys could flood exchanges with ancient Bitcoin, sending prices spiraling. This isn't about losing your Netflix password. This is about the complete collapse of digital trust across Bitcoin wallets, Ethereum smart contracts, DeFi protocols, banking systems, power grids, military communications, healthcare records, and government secrets. By leveraging its computational power, a quantum miner could consistently solve the mathematical puzzles required to add new blocks to the blockchain, transforming mining from a decentralized global industry into an oligopoly controlled by quantum-capable entities. Some optimists say we have until 2030 before quantum computers can break encryption. They're missing the point entirely. The damage is being done today. Every piece of data transmitted now is a future casualty. According to a December 2023 Reuters report, Tilo Kunz of cybersecurity firm Quantum Defen5e told Defense Information Systems Agency officials that Q-day could come as soon as 2025. Google Quantum AI has already lowered the barrier to breaking widely used RSA-2048 encryption to fewer than one million qubits, dramatically reducing the resources needed for crypto-breaking quantum attacks. Forget patches, updates, or hoping someone else will solve this. Quantum resistance must be built into the foundation, not bolted on as an afterthought. We need post-quantum cryptography that can withstand both classical and quantum attacks, quantum-resistant digital signatures using hash-based and lattice-based cryptography, complete blockchain infrastructure overhauls, immediate migration from vulnerable crypto addresses, and action now, not committees discussing action later. QRL’s Iain Wood warns: "It is now no longer controversial to say that all blockchains that exist by 2035 will have to be post-quantum secure." Researchers at the University of Kent say that upgrading to post-quantum crypto-systems could take 75 days of downtime for Bitcoin, or over 300 days if the network operated at 75% capacity. Think about what that means for a trillion-dollar asset class. Q-Day isn't a future problem—it's a present crisis. While everyone's chasing AI dreams, the quantum nightmare is unfolding. The harvest is happening now. The decryption is coming. 2025 is probably our last chance to start migration to post-quantum cryptography before we are all undone by cryptographically relevant quantum computers. Stop asking when Q-Day will arrive. It's here. The only question is: will you be ready, or will you be roadkill on the quantum highway? In the quantum age, there are only two types of data: quantum-safe and future-compromised. For crypto holders, there are only two types of digital assets: post-quantum secured and future-worthless. Your Bitcoin, your Ethereum, your entire crypto portfolio hangs in the balance. The quantum clock is ticking, and every second you wait is another step toward total cryptographic annihilation.

Title: Circle Applies to Establish National Trust Bank in the U.S. to Manage USDC reserves, Switching from BlackRock

Circle, a crypto company that issues USDC stablecoin, has applied to establish a national trust bank to manage USDC reserves on the company’s behalf and abide by US regulations. Circle has applied for the trust from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If the OCC approves, the trust would allow Circle to operate as a US-recognised trust institution. The announcement comes as US companies such as Circle try to integrate their services within traditional frameworks. Circle’s digital banking services would be better situated to provide USDC stablecoins to institutional investors, with the added benefit of custodial business services. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) can now decide whether Circle can operate a regulated trust institution. The trust will effectively allow Circle to manage its USDC holdings and validate its stablecoin issuing. This move would bolster USDC’s infrastructure and make it more competitive against larger stablecoins like Tether’s USDT. The new trust will also allow Circle to align its business practices with the new Genius Act, which has strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, to ensure that consumers get a fair go when investing in digital assets. There is another reason that Circle is taking the time to meet regulatory requirements. Circle is extending the reach of the US dollar to make it more powerful and to dominate foreign markets. The First National Digital Currency Bank, the name Circle gave to the new entity, would allow Circle to manage the custody of USDC for institutional clients. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, said that the approval would enable a financial network on the internet that is regulated yet accessible. In the meantime, BlackRock and BNY Mellon manage Circle’s USDC reserves. Allaire said the new currency bank would focus on digitising stocks and bonds. Circle maintains a strong relationship with BlackRock and BNY Mellon, wishing to use their services even with the new currency bank managing USDC reserves. Circle seems to be more interested in traditional services than working with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Circle may be trying to increase the dominance of the US dollar by seeking approval from federal and local authorities, one regulation at a time. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, commented that the company always sought the highest standards to build client trust. Allaire said that this was why he sought out a publicly listed company in the US, and now created a national trust company, to build trust by seeking high standards. Crypto was meant to be a trustless technology from the beginning. Who are these high standards built for, institutional investors or retail traders? There seems to be a demand for trust, even when trading trustless technologies, because crypto often has to be mediated through centralised exchanges. Stablecoins usually involve one-to-one pegging of a token with a real-world asset, such as Gold or USD. Many of these US stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins were used to transfer tokens on exchanges, such as between Ethereum and USDT. However, institutional investors have recently discovered that stablecoins could enable cheap transfers and fast cross-border transactions. Circle currently holds treasury bills to back up its USDC tokens. Circle employs BlackRock to manage its treasury bills. JPMorgan said that many companies, such as Amazon, MasterCard, and Walmart, may decide to create stablecoins to compete with USDC. With its IPO, Circle had such a resounding success that it may have inspired other companies to engage in stablecoin reserves. The race has begun for stablecoin dominance. But there was a stablecoin market way before the US companies started to cotton on to their potential. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, has been around for a long time and dominates the stablecoin market. There are serious risks involved in starting a stablecoin market. USDC already has a low share of stablecoins compared to other major issuers. Circle, therefore, may struggle to maintain dominance when other companies enter the market. Circle, however, has the advantage of maintaining a good relationship with US authorities. They may be able to extend this advantage to engaging with European markets. Circle (CRCL), meanwhile, experienced an all-time high last week at $260 on the stock market.
