Title: Whale alert: Over $1B in USDT minted as Bitcoin investors gear up to buy the dip

Bitcoin broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and is poised to hit the $88,500 level. Bitcoin [BTC], the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, appears bullish and is poised for massive upside momentum. This bullish outlook is further supported by the recent minting of 1 billion USDT by Tether, as reported by Arkham on X (formerly Twitter), indicating increased demand from institutions or exchanges. Historically, the minting of USDT is often seen as a bullish sign for the crypto industry, especially for large assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result of this mint, the overall cryptocurrency market is already witnessing an uptrend, rising by 1.80% over the past 24 hours, with BTC also breaking out from a bullish pattern. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, BTC has turned bullish on the smaller time frame. Recently, with ongoing upside momentum, it broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the hourly time frame. Based on the recent price momentum, if BTC closes its hourly candle above the $84,000 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50% to reach the upcoming resistance at $88,500 in the near future. Source: TraduingView At press time, BTC’s price was facing resistance from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame and appeared to be breaching it as well. If this occurs, BTC could see an imminent rally. In addition to this bullish price action, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain recently shared a post on X stating that Tether bought 8,888 BTC worth $735 million in Q1 2025. This occurred during a period when BTC experienced a price drop of over 18%, indicating that the current level could be an ideal buying opportunity. Tether is not the only major player that bought BTC during the recent price crash. Major firms like Strategy (MSTR), BlackRock, and others have also seized this opportunity and accumulated BTC. This massive purchase by these industry giants gives hope that the current level might be an ideal buying opportunity. At press time, BTC was trading near $84,100, having experienced a price surge of over 2.60% in the past 24 hours. Following the minting of 1 billion USDT and the recent breakout of a bullish pattern, traders and investors have shown strong interest in the asset, leading to a 45% jump in BTC’s trading volume during the same period. This surge in trading volume is explained by traders’ $1 billion worth of bullish bets. Today, the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that traders are over-leveraged at the $81,800 level on the lower side and $84,355 on the upper level, which is on the verge of liquidation. Source: Coinglass Data revealed that traders have built $989 million worth of long positions and $287 million worth of short positions at these over-leveraged levels in the past 24 hours. So, bulls are back, and that BTC could see an impressive upside move. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: China Blocks Panama Canal Port Sale — Report Claims Xi Jinping Infuriated by Deal Sought Without His Approval
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/04/01/china-blocks-panama-canal-port-sale-report-claims-xi-jinping-infuriated-by-deal-sought-without-his-approval/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T22:16:54Z
Full Content:
Chinese antitrust regulators on Friday blocked a deal by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison conglomerate to sell two ports along the Panama Canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock. The $22.8 billion transaction between CK Hutchison, which is controlled by 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, and BlackRock involved 43 port facilities around the world. It was scheduled to conclude by April 2. The most strategically important, and politically explosive, acquisitions of the sale were ports located at either end of the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has portrayed Chinese-owned ports on the Panama Canal as threats to American national security because the Chinese military could potentially use them to shut down the canal. He hailed the BlackRock deal as a major step toward alleviating that threat when it was announced in last month. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” Trump said on March 5. International markets seemed to like the arrangement as well, sending CK Hutchison stocks into the stratosphere. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not echoed this enthusiasm, according to new reporting by Al Jazeera and Watcher Guru, a finance and cryptocurrency website. Per the reports, Dictator Xi Jinping has allegedly been displeased that Li did not consult with him about the deal or clear it with Party officials. According to Al Jazeera: The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper [the Chinese state-run Ta Kung Pao] said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. Watcher Guru also cited a recent Ta Kung Pao op-ed as describing the transaction as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” Influential Chinese state media blasted CK Hutchison in mid-March for “spineless groveling,” while Beijing’s puppet administrator in Hong Kong, John Lee, ominously muttered that the deal deserved “serious attention” from regulators – even though there was no obvious legal pretext for the Chinese government to get involved. The necessary pretext was evidently discovered at the eleventh hour, as China’s State Administration for Market Regulation suddenly announced it would investigate the deal to “protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest.” Within hours of that announcement on Friday, CK Hutchison said “there will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week.” The sale is not technically dead, but there is presently no indication of how long the Chinese government intends to continue its vague antitrust investigation. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told the New York Post on Monday. The Post editorial board said Beijing’s effort to scuttle the BlackRock deal proves Trump was “dead right” about the menace China poses to U.S. interests in the Panama Canal. “China’s rulers look determined to retain control of the strategically critical maritime conduit – whether to threaten U.S. access to the key shipping lane or to ensure it will remain open to Chinese vessels no matter what,” the editors wrote. “Beijing might stand down when it realizes its heavy hand in Hong Kong’s commercial market will frighten more firms out of doing business there – yet another step toward killing the golden goose of what had been a global financial center,” they suggested. Beijing has indeed been fretting about the flight of foreign capital from Chinese markets, in part because the overbearing Communist regime has launched a string of crackdowns against both Chinese and foreign business operations. Also, despite carefully worded promises that Xi’s deranged citywide coronavirus lockdowns will never be repeated, the shadow of the immense damage from the pandemic looms large over foreign business decisions. BlackRock itself has about $16 billion invested in Chinese stocks, which might give the gigantic investment company enough leverage to get the CK Hutchison deal rolling again after a brief regulatory delay. Or Xi could use those investments as leverage against the company, threatening its portfolio to ensure BlackRock accepts the quiet demise of its Panama Canal ambitions. Al Jazeera on Tuesday suggested an internal Chinese political and cultural angle that might be almost as significant as the international ramifications of the Panama Canal deal. It suggested that there is bad blood between aging Chinese dictator Xi and the even more aged CK Hutchison tycoon Li Ka-shing. Li is something of a legend among Hong Kong investors, and Xi is severely allergic to businessmen who have a stronger grip on the public imagination than he does. Per Al Jazeera: Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. … In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. Legal and business analysts quoted by Al Jazeera tended to side with the White House official who spoke to the New York Post, predicting that it will be legally difficult for Beijing to kill the deal if Panama exercises its jurisdiction over the canal and gives its blessing. For that matter, the legal authority of Beijing’s top market regulator to quash transactions made by a Hong Kong company is dubious. The antitrust investigation announced on Friday could be an attempt to intimidate Li, his family, and CK Hutchison executives into backing out of the sale. And it could perhaps send a signal to other Chinese businessmen as the trade war heats up that no matter whose names are printed on their company letterhead, Xi Jinping is the chief executive officer of every business in China.

Title: Commentary: Even Hong Kong’s Li family can’t escape the politics of China-US rivalry

Commentary For two weeks, Hong Kong’s richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, held firm against Beijing over the planned sale of its Panama ports assets to BlackRock. That, in itself, is truly extraordinary, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: The arm wrestling between Beijing and Hong Kong's richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, over the controversial sale of Panama Canal ports to BlackRock, an American investment giant, has surprisingly persisted longer than anticipated. After two weeks of apparent silent defiance, the Li family seemed to relent on Friday (Mar 28) when local media, citing sources close to CK Hutchison, reported that the conglomerate founded by Mr Li would not proceed with the expected signing of a deal on Apr 2 to sell its two strategic ports at the Panama Canal. This development marks the latest flashpoint in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. On the same day, news emerged that Beijing would launch an antitrust probe into the sale, part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports across 23 countries to a consortium led by BlackRock. While Beijing may appear to have succeeded in delaying the sale, this does not necessarily mean the deal is dead. The saga is expected to continue in the coming weeks or even months, potentially involving top leadership in both Beijing and Washington. CK Hutchison announced the deal on Mar 4. Less than 10 days later, Beijing-controlled newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, which is based in Hong Kong, published two sharply worded commentaries, urging the Li family to “stop being naïve and confused”. They criticised CK Hutchison of being unpatriotic and "selling out all Chinese people." This marks the first time Beijing has publicly singled out Hong Kong's most prominent conglomerate for sharp criticism in the 27 years since the city's return to Chinese sovereignty, causing jitters and concerns about the politicisation of business in the local and broader business community. Beijing's apparent loss of composure stems from not being informed of the deal in advance, amid US media reports that BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink called US President Donald Trump to secure his blessing. Mr Trump hailed the deal as part of his administration's efforts to reclaim the Panama Canal. Despite finding themselves in a political storm, the Li family has surprisingly kept its cool. In fact, the Mar 4 announcement, which stated that the sale was purely commercial in nature and unrelated to geopolitics concerning the Panama ports, remains CK Hutchison's only public statement to date. Incensed by the silent treatment, Ta Kung Pao and another pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po have published at least 20 news stories and commentaries urging the Li family to respond to "public concerns" and halt the deal in the name of national interests and security. The wrangling reached a climax on Mar 26 when Bloomberg cited sources reporting that CK Hutchison was believed to be moving forward with the deal as scheduled, despite Beijing's anger over the transaction. In response, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office again signalled its displeasure by reposting two articles published by Ta Kung Pao on Mar 26 and 27, criticising CK Hutchison for capitulating to US pressure and sacrificing national interests. The following day, CK Hutchison finally relented amid reports that the State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing would investigate the deal "to ensure fair competition" and "safeguard the public interest." Until then, Beijing had hoped that intense media pressure would suffice to persuade the Li family to pause the deal, mindful of the potential impact on business confidence in Hong Kong and China if it intervened directly. Ta Kung Pao's use of politically charged language in its commentaries has caused dismay among Hong Kong businessmen, with accusations of "aiding and abetting evil" reminiscent of wording frequently used in China's past political campaigns. In the past, such pressure tactics would have quickly forced any Hong Kong company to capitulate. The Li family's ability to withstand the pressure for two weeks is truly extraordinary. In another extraordinary development, Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, seems to be distancing himself from CK Hutchison, which is controlled by his elder brother Victor Li. The younger Li attended a high-profile forum in Beijing with senior Chinese officials and global executives on Mar 23 and 24, in his capacity as founder of Pacific Century Group. On Mar 28, China's leading business media outlets, including Caixin, published stories stating that Pacific Century Group’s businesses operate independently. The articles particularly noted that Richard Li resigned from all positions at CK Hutchison in 2000. What happens next? The delay could mean that the main parties involved in the deal, including CK Hutchison and BlackRock, will have to renegotiate the terms to accommodate both Beijing's and Washington's concerns. More likely, it will be a topic of discussion in an anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump, expected to take place in the coming months.

Title: Will TikTok Be Banned Again? As Deadline Nears, Trump Says ‘I’d Like to See TikTok Remain Alive’

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Here we go again! TikTok faces a potential shutdown in the U.S. after Saturday, April 5, if its Chinese parent company doesn’t reach an agreement to sell a controlling interest in the hugely popular video app. Will TikTok go dark? With just days to go before the deadline set by President Trump, it’s not clear what will happen next for TikTok, which claims to have 170 million users in the U.S. Some background: A federal bill passed last year with bipartisan congressional support and signed into law by President Biden mandated that ByteDance sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or essentially face a nationwide ban of the app. TikTok, after losing an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, shut down the app in the U.S. on Jan. 18 ahead of the law’s deadline. But TikTok restored service to U.S. users about 14 hours later, citing President Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to broker a solution keeping the app legal. Related Stories VIP+ New Ubisoft Subsidiary for ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Underscores Need for IP Preservation in Transmedia Era Academy Apologizes for Not Naming 'No Other Land' Director Hamdan Ballal Amid Outcry From More Than 800 Voters Trump, who in his first term sought to force a sale of TikTok over national security concerns, now wants to keep it legal. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” he said in December, citing his belief that the app helped drive younger Americans to vote for him. Popular on Variety On Sunday, Trump told told reporters on Air Force One, “I’d like to see TikTok remain alive.” Regarding discussions about a sale of a stake in TikTok, he said, “We have a lot of potential buyers. There’s tremendous interest in TikTok,” adding, “The decision is gonna be my decision.” Who could end up owning a piece of TikTok? Oracle, which has an agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data, reportedly has been in discussions about a deal. Private-equity firm Blackstone has been mulling taking a “small stake” in the app, the New York Times reported, while others — including YouTube superstar MrBeast — have been in the mix among possible buyers. But there are wrinkles in clinching a deal. The TikTok divest-or-ban law expressly prohibits TikTok’s operation in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance; meanwhile, the Chinese government has expressed opposition to any TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. “We see no way that the TikTok algorithm is sold as Beijing and ByteDance would view this as a non-starter in a deal,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note Tuesday. Last week, Trump suggested he would use U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports as a bargaining chip in trying to win approval for a TikTok deal. “Maybe I’ll give [China] a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he told reporters. One percentage point in tariffs with China “would probably be worth more than all of TikTok, as valuable as TikTok is,” the president added. Some observers believe if April 5 comes and goes without a TikTok deal nailed down, Trump would simply declare another extension. On Jan. 20, Trump issued an executive order deferring enforcement of the divest-or-ban law by 75 days — a move that the law’s supporters said had no legal basis. As directed by Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent both Apple and Google letters that they wouldn’t be liable for hosting TikTok during the 75-day period, prompting both tech companies to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores. VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban — and It’s Not RedNote If there’s no deal by April 5, Trump would likely issue another order delaying the TikTok ban by “30 days or longer” to “fully iron out the complex deal structure,” according to Ives. The analyst said a point of deal negotiation would be ByteDance retaining minority ownership in TikTok “but potentially higher than the 20% threshold currently required by U.S. law.” Ives expects ByteDance will continue to control TikTok’s content algorithm. “We believe TikTok’s valuation is roughly $100 billion, but without the golden jewel algorithm the deal price/valuation is closer to $30 billion to $40 billion in our view,” he wrote. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees (including U.S. employees). According to the U.S.’s divest-or-ban law that targets TikTok, ByteDance is prohibited from directly or indirectly owning more than 20% of TikTok. Amid the uncertainty about TikTok’s future in the U.S., the company has seen some senior execs exit. Those include Ole Obermann, global head of music business development, and Blake Chandlee, who oversaw ad sales and marketing as head of global business solutions. Meanwhile, TikTok last week hired Nathaniel Brown, formerly Warner Bros. Discovery’s head of corporate communications, as global corporate communications chief. It’s worth noting that ByteDance did, at one point, consider selling a large position in TikTok to U.S.-based companies. Back in 2020, after Trump ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok to U.S. entities, ByteDance reached a tentative deal with Oracle and Walmart, which under the proposed terms would have acquired a combined 20% stake in TikTok. But that was scrapped after Biden assumed office in 2021 and the new administration repealed Trump’s executive order pending further review.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is Challenging a 73-Year-Old Investing Principle

For over 70 years, professional investors have relied on an investment strategy known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Developed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and Bill Sharpe, MPT popularized the classic 60/40 portfolio—roughly 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds—as a way to diversify risk and maximize returns. But Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, is now questioning that long-standing principle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the global financial system evolves, Fink argues, a better formula to allocate assets should be something like a 50/30/20 portfolio: 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 20 percent private assets, such as infrastructure, real estate and equity in privately owned companies. Fink proposed this idea in his annual letter to investors published this week, dedicating a substantial section to private markets and calling for broader access to private assets for retail investors. Private assets encompass infrastructure projects like ports, bridges, and power grids, as well as companies that aren’t publicly traded. Historically, these investments have been the domain of governments, bank loans, and wealthy individuals who have to meet strict income or capital thresholds. While they carry higher risks, these investments also tend to offer greater returns. As more companies (especially rapidly-growing ones in Silicon Valley) stay private for longer and the demand for infrastructure surges, governments and banks are struggling to keep up. “Assets that will define the future…aren’t available to most investors,” Fink wrote. “As we enter our century’s second quarter, there’s a growing mismatch between the demand for investment and the capital available from traditional sources.” To help close this funding gap, BlackRock is channeling its clients into private market opportunities through a series of strategic acquisitions. BlackRock’s clients include institutional investors—like pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies—as well as retail investors who can own a piece of BlackRock’s portfolio through its mutual funds and iShare ETFs. In October 2024, BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a firm owning and operating assets in energy, transportation, water and waste management, and digital infrastructure sectors. BlackRock is also in the process of acquiring Preqin, a leading data provider specializing in private markets, and HPS Investment Partners, an asset manager of private credit. Beyond access, another obstacle that discourages investors from entering private markets is a lack of transparency. “Investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible,” Fink wrote. “For decades, private markets have been among the most opaque corners of finance. Investors know these assets hold long-term value—but exactly how much value? That’s not always easy to determine,” he added. The answer to that questions lies in data—think how Zillow brings clarity on real estate and what Bloomberg terminals do for stocks and bonds. BlackRock aims to provide the same level of transparency to private markets through data providers like Preqin, which tracks 190,000 funds and 60,000 private asset managers globally. “Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing,” Fink wrote. “With clearer, more timely data, it becomes possible to index private markets just like we do now with the S&P 500,” the CEO added. “Once that happens, private markets will be accessible, simple markets. Easy to buy. Easy to track. And that means capital will flow more freely throughout the economy.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock Plans for Texas ETF Amid Its Push Into Lone Star State

BlackRock Inc. is going even bigger in Texas. The world’s biggest asset manager applied for the iShares Texas Equity exchange-traded fund, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The planned ETF would be passively managed and invest in companies that are headquartered in Texas. It’s the latest in a charm offensive of sorts in the state for the investing giant and founder Larry Fink after the firm’s embrace of environmental, social and governance investing drew the ire of Republican lawmakers. BlackRock, alongside Citadel Securities, is also an early backer of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange, which aims to begin trading in 2026. While declining to comment on the ETF beyond the filing, a BlackRock spokesperson said there’s client demand for Texas exposure. “Our clients have expressed interest in accessing the Texas economy, which has a GDP of $2.6 trillion according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and would be the eighth largest economy in the world on a standalone basis,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email. Nasdaq announced earlier this month that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas, stating that it has about 800 clients in Texas. About 200 companies listed on Nasdaq are headquartered in the Lone Star state. The New York Stock Exchange said in February that it would launch a fully electronic exchange in Dallas and reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas. Fees and a ticker for the fund were not yet listed in the filing. While many asset managers — including BlackRock — control single-country equity funds, state-specific stock funds are far less common. The Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (ticker TXS) and the Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF (TXSS), which both launched in 2023, have amassed about $28 million and $12 million, respectively. “The rationale here is that Texas is a good environment for businesses, and a lot are moving there,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “Anybody can buy this if it starts to crush it, and if it starts to crush it, then the narrative will kick in.” Topics Texas

Title: Kevin Mayer Talks Candle Media, Tightening Content Market, YouTube, TikTok and Blackstone at Paley Dialogues Event

Hollywood content 'is becoming less and less relevant' to young consumers, a trend that creates a 'substantial secular challenge,' veteran executive says By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Fiddling while Rome burns? Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer asserted that Hollywood should be much more concerned about demographic shifts and changes in consumer behavior as the math doesn’t look good for the traditional TV and film business. Mayer spoke Monday evening at the Paley Dialogue session hosted by the Paley Center for Media at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. In the session moderated by Jenelle Riley, deputy awards and features editor for Variety, Mayer said the traditional entertainment industry needs to act with more urgency to find new ways to reach consumers. Since the dawn of the millennial generation, time spent with traditional TV shows and movies is falling by double digits every couple of decades, he asserted. Related Stories VIP+ Sports Rights: Streamers vs. TV Networks – A Special Report Why Oscars and Golden Globes Announcing Their Hosts and Dates Early Helps Awards Season “Not only is Hollywood becoming less and less relevant and less and less time spent on it, the time is spent is less profitable,” Mayer said, citing the economics of streaming content versus linear TV of old. “So there is a very substantial secular challenge that the industry is facing. There’s been some alarm, but maybe not quite enough.” Popular on Variety Mayer, who spent more than 15 years as a senior executive at Disney and then briefly served as CEO of TikTok’s U.S. operations in 2020, cited the dramatic shifts in the content marketplace that have emerged since the end of the pandemic and the double strikes that crippled the industry in 2023. Candle Media was created in 2021 by Mayer and his former Disney colleague Tom Staggs on the theory that high-end independent production would become more valuable in a world increasingly dominated by verticially integrated studios and streamers — like the operation he helped build at Disney. Mayer acknowledged that the sharp post-strikes contraction in content commissions by global giants has created some challenges for Candle. But the other foundational idea behind the company has proven to be very prescient given all the industry gyrations and the embrace by younger consumers of social-driven video platforms. “So it’s been much harder to sell content than the streamers now than it was three years ago when we launched,” Mayer said. “So that part of our thesis was pretty incorrect. The other part of the thesis was that there would be a flywheel that would evolve. And this is something that came from my TikTok days — that if you marry social media storytelling with traditional media storytelling, film and TV, on platforms where there’s an interactivity and you can interact with your audience and gain their trust and then sell them things, then commerce would be a big thing. And that is what we call content, community and commerce. That’s a flywheel that we felt would be a really powerful one. And that is definitively true today.” Candle’s early spree of acquisitions — including Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and “Cocomelon” producer Moonbug Entertainment — were financed by coin from private equity giant Blackrock. Despite the shifting sands in the content marketplace, Mayer assured the crowd of industry insiders that Blackrock remains steadfast in its Candle investment. “We have an incredibly great private equity partner, Blackstone, which is the biggest alternative investment manager in the world by quite a big margin. They are super0supportive,” Mayer says. They’ve been with us through thick and thin. And when we find great acquisitions, they’re ready to go and support us quite well.” Mayer suggested that future acquisitions would be “on the Moonbug side,” presumably focused on digital native content with a strong social media component. Mayer and Riley spent a good deal of time talking about the importance of YouTube as a distribution platform. “YouTube has been slogging away for 20 years, and it’s the biggest out there,” Mayer said. Most important, he added, is that YouTube shells out real money to the most popular content creators. “They pay content creators now — no one else does that. You can make money on Instagram and TikTok by going directly to a marketer and cutting a deal with them for doing an influencer marketing campaign. But the player that actually directly pays in a meaningful way its creators is YouTube.” The conversational naturally wound its way around to AI and the impact of powerful new generative AI and machine learning tools on the craft and business of entertainment. Mayer said he absorbed enormous lessons after in four months at the helm of TikTok in the U.S. “TikTok really derives its value due to his AI recommendation,” he said. “It really is another form of AI which just understands your preferences and can react and get your recommendations. And that’s what Tiktok engine is. This algorithm is one big AI code that detects your most nuanced usage of the app and can tell you exactly what you love in a way that even you don’t even know.” His four-month run as CEO of TikTok USA and COO of parent company Bytedance was more turbulent than he could have imagined. It was clear after a short time that it was untenable during President Donald Trump’s first term. Four years later, however, Trump gave TikTok a stay of digital execution as he returned to the White House. He allowed the app to resume limited operations, after the Biden administration set a deadline for the app to be sold to an American-owned firm or go dark in the U.S., while stepping up efforts to find a buyer. “I was there for a short period of time because Trump was shutting us down and issued executive orders shutting down TikTok –it was very tough to be an American executive and be the head of that company. So I stepped away from that,” he said. “I don’t know for sure what’s going on there. Seems like it has a decent chance of sticking around. But the story about TikTok is almost as interesting as using TikTok itself.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Bill Amending Oklahoma’s Anti-ESG Law Dies

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. A bill in the Oklahoma Legislature to amend the state’s three-year-old anti-ESG law died last week after criticism that it would water down efforts to avoid public investments in companies boycotting oil and gas companies. ESG is an acronym for environmental, social, and governance-based investing. Oklahoma’s 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee had advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, a Republican. Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore, also a Republican, sponsored a House version. But state GOP lawmakers were divided on the matter. The bill would have removed responsibility for enforcing the law—that deals with pension investments—from the state treasurer’s office to the state attorney general’s office. “Overall, the bill would have diluted anti-ESG protections. So, I was glad to see it go,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader, the Senate sponsor, previously told The Daily Signal his bill was to “make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit.” He added that the legislation was to keep the anti-ESG law applicable, not to dilute it. Hild argued that litigation still working through the courts is not grounds to make changes. “The lawsuit was without merit,” Hild said. “The district judge overreached. It should be a basic function of government to decide who it does business with. The Legislature was overwhelmingly in support of this. Using the judiciary as an excuse not to enforce this is absurd.” Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies, including BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. The failed state Senate bill would have transferred enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. It would have also changed disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. “I was one of the many thousands of Oklahomans that called senators urging them to stop the consideration of SB 714 from forcing radical pro-ESG policies on our state,” Suzanne Ashmore, a Heritage Action for America Grassroots Sentinel from Norman, Oklahoma, told The Daily Signal. “Sentinels met with our representatives and senators in Oklahoma City to urge them to protect our oil and gas jobs and our hard earned savings from woke politics. We won’t let corporate elites crush our way of life. I’m encouraged that legislators listened.” Critics said the bill’s language would allow large asset managers to pressure companies to cut fossil fuel production through threats to vote against board members. Further, critics said that the bill would create a loophole for government agencies to ignore the statute. “ESG has become a political tool used by the Left to impose its progressive ideology on the American people. It is divisive, creates inefficiency, and has no place in Oklahoma. Heritage Action is pleased the Oklahoma Senate recognized the dangers of SB 714’s pro-ESG’s provisions and stopped it in its tracks,” Catherine Gunsalus, director of state advocacy for Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal. “We look forward to continuing the work alongside an army of grassroots Americans across the country to ensure ESG does not interfere with their livelihoods.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Dublin office market continues on road to recovery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/01/dublin-office-market-continues-on-road-to-recovery/

The Dublin office leasing market continued its recovery in the first quarter of this year with take-up totalling nearly 39,500 sq m (425,025 sq ft). This is more than double the level seen in the same period in the first three months of 2024, but continues to lag behind the long-term quarterly average of nearly 60,000 sq m (425,175 sq ft). The improvement in the latest period follows a rebound in activity in the second half of last year. The full-year take-up for 2024 was up 66 per cent year on year. There is currently nearly 140,000 sq m (1.5 million sq ft) of stock reserved in the city, with nearly 30 per cent of this (44,129 sq m /475,000 sq ft) accounted for by Workday’s agreement to locate its new European headquarters offices at College Square, the major mixed-use scheme being developed by Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in Dublin city centre. Workday’s decision to locate at College Square was first reported by The Irish Times in August of last year. The largest deal of the latest quarter meanwhile was at Three Wilton Park, where big-four accounting group EY exercised their option to take an additional 5,100 sq m (54,896 sq ft) of space following their deal last year to lease 12,400 sq m (133,472 sq ft) at the neighbouring Two Wilton Park. The deal means that there is now no more available space at the Wilton Park scheme, where Stripe will occupy Number One, EY will occupy Number Two and three floors at Number Three, with LinkedIn occupying the remaining space. Other notable deals in the quarter include the signing of a long-term lease for two floors at Four Park Place, where a private-and-confidential occupier secured 3,512 sq m (36,712 sq ft). US-headquartered financial giant Blackrock secured a deal to occupy 2,000 sq m (21,527 sq ft) of space at Glencar House in Ballsbridge in Dublin 4. Just over 40 per cent of all deal activity in the quarter involved sustainable (Grade A+) buildings. Technology occupiers were the most active tenant group during the quarter, accounting for 27 per cent of take-up, while professional-services occupiers accounted for a further 24 per cent of all activity. Colin Richardson, head of research at CBRE Ireland said: “Rather than focusing solely on the volume of leasing completed in the first three-month period, we take encouragement from the outstanding requirements in the market.” “Demand is trending positively, and the level of reserved stock is a positive leading indicator. We expect take-up to continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of global macroeconomic uncertainty has yet to be felt in the Dublin market, but subject to announcements this week, will likely impact some decision-making as the year progresses.” Ronald Quinlan is Property Editor of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/01/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-renewable-energy-pragmatism-wind-solar/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, historically a supporter of green energy initiatives, acknowledged that wind and solar alone “can’t reliably keep the lights on” without “major breakthroughs in storage” and wrote that it’s necessary to be “clear-eyed about our energy mix” in his annual chairman’s letter to investors on Monday. Fink supported the transition to green energy in the past and heads BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, which has pushed for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG). Fink said in 2023 that he would no longer use the term ESG due to its political connotation, though he’s “not ashamed” of the term and believes in “conscious capitalism.” Fink praised nuclear power and raised doubts Monday regarding the reliability of solar and wind energy alone due to storage issues in his annual chairman’s letter. “We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix,” Fink wrote in the letter. “Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can’t reliably keep the lights on.” (RELATED: ‘Gambling With The Grid’: New Data Highlights Achilles’ Heel Of One Of Biden’s Favorite Green Power Sources) Andrew Ross Sorkin speaks with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink during the New York Times DealBook Summit on November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) “In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down,” Fink said. “Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear.” In the letter, Fink points out that more nuclear power plants have been shut down than built in the U.S. over the past 55 years and lays out the benefits to nuclear energy. “Today’s nuclear isn’t the old model of massive plants with the ominous cooling towers,” he continued. “Small modular reactors (SMRs) are everything old nuclear wasn’t — cheaper to build, safer to run, and you can build them anywhere.” (RELATED: Nuclear Energy Could Be A Godsend For Biden’s Green Agenda. Here’s What’s Holding It Back) In 2020, Fink’s letter to CEOs was focused on the fight against climate change. His 2024 chairman’s letter also called for “energy pragmatism,” though it noted that countries were increasingly installing renewables “with wind and solar power,” as it was “now cheaper in many places than fossil-fuel-generated electricity.” Fink noted that pursuing these energy sources was “also a major way to address climate change.” “We follow our clients’ mandates,” Fink wrote in the 2024 letter. “BlackRock has more than $300 billion invested in traditional energy firms on behalf of our clients. Of that $300 billion, more than half – $170 billion – is in the U.S. We invest in these energy companies for one simple reason: It’s our clients’ money. If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it – the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients.” Fink’s 2025 letter did not mention climate change, though it noted that China’s push for nuclear energy demonstrates that “they see decarbonization as a way to own the future of industry.” House Republicans sent letters to BlackRock and other asset management companies in 2023 to address concerns that their ESG efforts violated federal antitrust laws. Lawmakers wrote at the time that the companies appeared to have colluded “to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management.” BlackRock exited the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative in January of this year.

Fink added that tokenization would ‘democratize’ markets and would one day become familiar to investors like ETFs are today. Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, projected that Bitcoin [BTC] could dislodge the U.S. dollar from global reserve status. Fink cautioned that the U.S. dollar has enjoyed world reserve currency for decades, but that won’t last forever. Part of his annual letter to investors read, “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Source: BlackRock The U.S. currently has about $36 trillion in debt, with interest payments alone amounting to nearly $1 trillion for 2025. Fink added, “By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit.” In 2023, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz made a similar projection, as rising fiscal debt raises fears of currency devaluation and inflation. In fact, BlackRock made another recent call, stating that a recession would boost BTC’s value. In such a scenario, investors could resort to scarce alternatives, like gold and BTC, as a store of value. Besides, Fink expected real-world tokenized assets (RWA) to gain traction and called it ‘democratization.’ “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close.” Reacting to the Link’s statement, Nate Geraci of ETF Store said that top assets managers were ‘all in.’ For his part, DeFi research analyst, Ignas, termed Fink’s outlook on tokenization as ‘super bullish for crypto.’ Source: BlackRock That said, BTC was valued at $83K ahead of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs update.

On March 4, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. ... China President Xi Jinping is reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s plans to sell its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand ... The timing of the deal’s announcement, coming just before the start of the “two sessions,” China’s most significant annual political and economic gathering, only deepened the offense for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Panama Canal — used extensively by both the US and China — has reemerged as a flashpoint in global politics after President Trump renewed his pledge to assert American dominance over the waterway. Beijing’s move to influence the affairs of CK Hutchison reinforced concerns among global observers about China’s diminishing distinction between private and public sectors as well as its aggressive encroachment into Hong Kong’s affairs.

by Boris Groysberg and Eric Lin Our previous article on the persistent negative impact of resume gaps received a good deal of reader attention. It’s not surprising, given the events of 2024 in the white-collar talent market. From the very start of the year, companies like Amazon, BlackRock, and Citigroup announced white-collar job reduction efforts. In the fall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported one in four American workers who lost their jobs last year came from the business and professional services sector. In September alone, nearly half a million such jobs were eliminated, the highest number for such positions in two years. Tech, media, consulting, and finance jobs are drying up at alarming rates.

Title: Investors are stunned after the stock market closed its worst quarter in 3 year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/investors-have-pain-ahead-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-01T11:42:13Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Congratulations to Vice President JD Vance, who sold his home just outside Washington, DC, for $172,000 over the asking price after less than three weeks on the market. The buyer? A former Trump official. In today's big story, investors are shocked to be battling against President Donald Trump as the stock market closed its worst quarter in three years. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is setting his sights on private markets. Tech: Move over, Disney. YouTube is about to dominate media. Business: America has an affordable housing problem. Paris has the solution. But first, there may be more pain ahead for Wall Street. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Investors have come to a grim realization: Trump's not in their corner. The stock market on Monday wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022. After back-to-back years of double-digit gains, yesterday's plunge showed just how much Trump has surprised markets since returning to the White House. It seems he is no longer the market's champion. The White House has telegraphed its position stating as much, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. "Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers," the Treasury secretary said last month. Instead of equity prices, the White House is focusing on the 10-year Treasury yield to lower borrowing costs. Meanwhile, inflation and recession fears have intensified under Trump's tariff campaign. Consumer sentiment has dropped to multi-year lows and CEO confidence is spiraling as planning for the future becomes more difficult. To make matters worse, investors should prepare for another three months of pain ahead. Once-bullish investors are feeling shellshocked coming into the second quarter. "The expected fallout from Trump 2.0's Reign of Tariffs undercuts our former bullishness and dims the prospects of our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario for now," veteran analyst Ed Yardeni wrote. He lowered his S&P 500 year-end target to 6,100 from a prior forecast of 6,400. At the same time, Goldman Sachs cut its three-month target for the index to 5,300, a possible 5% drop from current levels. It's now the eve of Trump's "Liberation Day," and investors are nervously awaiting the unveiling of a range of reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. With so much uncertainty ahead, Deutsche Bank flagged three risks to watch in the coming quarter. 1. Floyd Mayweather's big commercial real estate boasts don't match reality. The retired boxing champ has bragged about a $400 million purchase of 62 Manhattan apartment buildings. But in the month since his announcement, there's been no evidence of a sale. 2. CEO Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock. After decades of dominating the liquid markets, BlackRock is betting big on private markets. Fink wrote about the transformation in his annual letter to investors, saying the firm is focused on a "$68 trillion boom" in infrastructure. 3. Newsmax might be the newest Trump trade. The conservative media company soared more than 700% in its stock market debut, valuing Newsmax at about $8 billion. That's double the valuation of Trump Media and a third of Fox Corp. 1. YouTube is about to eclipse Disney as the biggest media company in the world. The company brought in $54.2 billion in revenue in 2024, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, which is only $5.5 billion behind Disney. But people still don't seem to understand how big YouTube really is, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 2. Elon Musk is spending millions on a supercomputer, but can he run it? xAI is spending at least $400 million on building the world's largest supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to documents viewed by BI. But it's short on the power needed to operate it. 3. Tumblr is Gen Z's newest safe space. Yes, millennials, you heard that right. Gen Zers, fed up with Musk and Zuckerberg, are reviving Tumblr dot com. How long they'll stay, however, is another question. 1. Tesla told salesworkers to "stay vigilant" in a video sent before last weekend's protests. The company described a "dynamic environment" in a clip sent to sales staff. It featured smiling employees, promo footage of Optimus and Robotaxi, and a dog — but no direct mention of the recent protests. One employee called it "trivial" and "disappointing." 2. To fix America's affordable housing problem, be more French. Paris' 19th-century redesign achieved both an unrivaled urban population density and a signature look for the city. Adopting Euro-style zoning can help US cities lower housing costs and look good doing it. 3. Don't be surprised to see Gucci ads on Fox News. Conservative media outlets say they're seeing an uptick in advertising from major brands. It's a sign advertisers now see avoiding right-leaning media as a risk — and it's also a 180 from the brand boycotts of Trump's first term.

From Aurelien by e-mail: She’s speaking at the moment but it doesn’t look good. What she did was not unprecedented in the French system (basically moving money around to meet costs elsewhere) but it was done very clumsily, and left a paper trail behind. She also denied everything from the word go, in spite of the evidence, and her defence witnesses were very unconvincing. It just goes to show that the RN is actually a pretty amateurish organisation, with a very limited capability outside Le Pen herself. I don’t think anyone else is capable of running in 2027. The political consequences are effectively impossible to predict at this stage. From Politico’s EU morning newsletter: IS LE PEN MIGHTIER THAN THE COURT? “I’m combative. I won’t let myself be eliminated,” a visibly infuriated Marine Le Pen said Monday evening. In her first interview after an embezzlement conviction that leaves her unable to run for office for five years, the far-right icon conspicuously refused to endorse her lieutenant in the National Rally, Jordan Bardella. That was the first sign of where Le Pen’s head is at as she makes an agonizing choice, as my colleagues Clea Caulcutt and Marion Solletty lay out: — Let them eat cake: After painstakingly transforming her father’s racist party into an electable force, Le Pen was a strong contender to win the French presidency in 2027. So she could boost Bardella to take the top spot on the ticket. — Après Marine, le déluge? Or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the French justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. Both options come with risks. Bardella is still seen as green (profile here). And so far, the French public seem pretty comfortable with Monday’s court ruling. An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro published Monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that France had a healthy democracy. Another 65 percent said they were “satisfied” or “indifferent” to the verdict, Victor Goury-Laffont reports. LIBERAL UNEASE: Yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. Sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law — Le Pen was convicted of misusing European Parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. But it’s not a popular rejection by the demo.

On a side note, the phrase ‘Empire of Chaos’ dates to at least 1814. Not the first time that Khartoum has been under siege and has fallen- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6UfPtyjYQo (4:43 mins) I was lucky enough to visit Khartoum for a wedding fifteen or so years ago (an Establishment British friend married a high society British-Sudanese girl). It was quite an affair (2,000 people in a tent, every man with his stick, three days of celebrations and not a drop to drink…) and the city and country were a wonderful experience. We had to take cash and travellers’ cheques though because the country was cut off from SWIFT and only Diners card worked. As a result, the “Hilton” had long ago stopped paying licence fees to the brand owner but had kept the name. :-) We visited the pyramids at Meroe (now controlled by warlords); we spent afternoons in the fabulous National Museum (now looted); we saw the Sufi’s whirling in Omdurman (now a horror scene along with Khartoum). It was a well ordered, proud, dignified society that had made the best of a thin hand after it threw off colonial rule. The destruction of Sudan by Great Power meddling is a great crime. That sounds like an amazing experience. I knew a few cyclists who managed to cycle through the country back before it was ruined – they said that in all of Africa they had never experienced such hospitality, and they always felt safe. I was immediately struck by this headline. But the reason was that I could no longer imagine any horrors that were “unimaginable.” As I read on this was confirmed, the horrors sounded all too familiar. For example: “…They recount a siege of theft and murder, as a trigger-happy RSF militia shot those who resisted their demands. Afraid to carry their dead to graveyards, people buried those killed in shallow graves in their own streets and back yards. Elsewhere, corpses have been left to decompose where they fell. Widespread sexual violence against the civilian population has been reported from the early days of the war. It is an indication of the total siege that Khartoum was under that there isn’t yet a reliable estimate of the death toll.” For “RSF” substitute “IDF,” and for “Khartoum” substitute “Gaza.” As Clark’s list suggests, we could play this game all day. There’s no shortage of such scenes. Far from being “unimaginable,” we have to fight to keep from being numb to them. I’ve been in Khartoum a number of times for professional reasons, and whilst I can’t say it’s my favourite African country, I was always well looked after and the people are very hospitable. The Sudanese are an also a proud people and I remember being taken around the National Museum, and being told that the Sudanese had pyramids when the Egyptians were in short trousers. They were also proud of never being an Arab colony, but adopting Islam voluntarily because it had a well-developed system of commercial law. But the problem is a regime that has kept power by force (with a brutality comparable with we’ve seen in recent days) and cynically instrumentalised Islam as a way of controlling the population. It was always argued that the regime’s practice of subcontracting security to militias in distant areas of the country would backfire, and now it has. With regards to your quote on news about Marine LePen, i was wondering that OK, RN schemes were clumsily done and left a trail, but, what if in other cases there are similar trails to be followed but those aren’t followed because there is less interest in doing the same with “establishment” parties. The orders could be “focus please only on parties deemed as menaces” no matter what you find. Just as a possibility. Re: Honey bee collapse. I am a bee keeper myself and a pretty big one as hobby keepers go. It is the same story like with bird flu. You have completely unnatural conditions that result in bad immunity that result in enhanced disease. Nobody looks at the underlying conditions and “specialists” “veterinarians” a.s.o. look for some magic solution. Some basics: bees in nature stay in one place and then collect nektar, pollen a.s.o. from plants that offer the bees sustenance at various times of spring into the summer. All that in a natural order. First bloom the cherries, then the apples and at the end the chestnut trees. On top there are hundreds of different flowers, scrubs a.s.o. Each plant offers something slightly different to the bees. In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year. After the first half of the year you take away the larger part of honey and substitute it with sugar. That is how small beekeepers work all over the world. Big commercial bee keepers move from one mass flowering to the next. For instance canola to almonds. As you have mono cultures you can´t leave the bees in place. In an almond grove there would be no other food but the nektar from almonds and after the bloom bees would simply starve to death. And as the almonds groves are so massive in California you must get the bees from out of state. So commercial bee keepers need to truck their bees over hundreds and thousands of miles. From the above you can see that it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food. All that is apart from all the pesticides and fungicides that are in use in intensive agriculture. Just as you won´t get rid of bird flu in chicken concentration camps you will also never have healthy bees under such circumstances. There is no other option but to dial back the industrialisation of agriculture. Except it won´t happen unless there´s a catastrophy. Seems like we are heading that way. As with bird flu – in order not to be forced to look at the whole picture – they will try ever new band aids and find ever new “reasons” for the sudden problems. “… it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food.” Interestingly it’s also how we’re harming ourselves with highly processed foods. Lack of the right mix of foods to support good gut health and lack of vital micro nutrients that never make it through the processing of the food ingredients. Almonds have really been a disaster cloaked initially by being so damn profitable, which only encouraged everybody and their mother to plant ever more of the jackrabbit of food bearing trees (some varieties will get you a commercial crop after only 4 years) to the point where there are more almond trees in Cali than there are citizens in the USA, and every last one of them needs pollinators. Then the wholesale price went from $4.50 to a buck fifty a pound, and growers are going b/k all over the place, but not before playing a huge part in the destruction of our bee population in the USA. Bees there-done that “In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year.” Wasn’t there also the practice in traditional agriculture to have some late-flowering plants (e.g. ivy) around to enable bees to forage in Autumn? In the traditional agriculture in my yard, I have plants that bloom from early spring (crocus) to late fall (aster) with the intention that there will always be something around for the bees. I do plant a vegetable garden too, and I have gotten in the habit of letting at least some of my broccoli go to flower. The bees really like the yellow blossoms in the fall since they are one of the few flowers around in our area at that time. Didn’t this happen also in the early 2000s? I remember a save the bees campaign back then with predictions of a crop apocalypse. What happened, why no apocalypse that time? It was Neonicotinoids then I believe Support your local beekeepers. I have had an at least one serving per day honey habit for years. My local sources include one beekeeper who sells at the farmers market in MA and another from an activist beekeeper up north in VT. I also have a jar of Oacaxa honey (very intense) for special occasions. (A long time ago in college I worked at the usda bee culture lab in Madison. Which is where I learned to out honey in burns.) Nice to hear that you buy honey local. In fact the honey will be in sync with nature around you and with you as well. Also ask your local bee keeper to give you some propolis and some wax. Propolis helps against all kind of ailments and it is not difficult to make your own tincture and ointment once you have the above. Big pharma doesn´t like propolis ointments (acting through the FDA) but you can make your own. The farmers market here starts again in about three weeks. I will ask. Thanks. To the extent that people in cities, towns and suburbs spend some of their disposable income on “artisanal” food from relatively nearby, to just that extent will little zones of artisanal and “artisindustrial” agriculture survive right near those centers of customer spending on less-industrial food. And pay cash if you can. Many commercial beekeepers treat bees like slave labourers, starve them, destroy their social behaviours, overcrowd them and infest them with pests, and then are shocked – Shocked! – they die in droves. And expect people to pity them and compensate them for their losses. Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam!

Coming soon: Skipper “Body Shop” mix and match gender transactional clinic with attached Playground. The swings go both ways! That is funny! Diego Garcia is a gift to Iran. A military base used by the USA but technically controlled by the UK (we can ignore Mauritius’s claims) with essentially no civilian population who might be hit (there was an encampment of some unlucky migrants who washed up in a boat years ago but they were recently removed). It’s the perfect target for a demonstration of strength. Or do the UK and USA see this and encourage it? Has the USA moved all its B2 bombers there to tempt Iran into doing something it can use as an excuse for USA and Israeli escalation? They certainly didn’t move them there to bomb Iran. Those aren’t fighting bombers, they’re for trading etc…. Another western own-goal….in that the US is/will be using B-2s over Yemen as apparently the US Navy can’t park a carrier off the coast of Yemen (as the US did in 1967 off of Vietnam) without using all of its anti-air ammo. B-2s have a finite, expensive lifespan before needing lots of maintenance. Billions of dollars of capital, operating at millions of dollars per hour…all to “destroy” a military operated by a country that is not even recognized by 100% of the countries around the world. Team Trump is continuing Team Biden’s strategy of (a) “doing something” and kicking the can down the road is better than (b) sitting at a table and hashing out an agreement that might be incrementally negative for Israel. Someone should show Trump a map. Maybe leave it on his Oval Office desk. On this map, Yemen is labeled in big red letters “Mini Vietnam” Iran “Big Vietnam” Ukraine “Big Mama Vietnam” and China-Taiwan “Big Daddy Vietnam”. GOP = MAGA held by the puppet strings of “I stand with Zion”…. even Trump can’t grasp that Diego Garcia plays a prominent role in Twilight’s Last Gleaning, JM Greer’s all too plausible story of how the American empire finally comes crashing down Remember that part of the book well. The Chinese take Diego Garcia in a well planned raid but that was in response to the US bombing a Chinese mainland air base to teach them a lesson. Yeah, and events in the non-fiction world are proceeding unnervingly like they do in the book. Doesn’t take much imagination to see an aircraft carrier washed up on a beach somewhere. The story ends on a rather hopeful note – won’t give it away, but it’s not the worst possible outcome, not by a long shot I found that ending to be very hopeful as well. But to think that it all started because the US tried to smash & grab an African country so that they steal their newly discovered oil. Can’t imagine where Greer got that idea I just watched the movie “Twilight’s Last Gleaming,” 1977, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Perhaps there’s a different movie of the same name but the one I saw doesn’t seem to match up with comments like “American empire finally comes crashing down..” In the movie I saw Lancaster convinced the president played by Charles During to admit to the public the reason for the Viet Nam war. In the end Durning, Lancaster, and his cohorts are all shot down to prevent the public from knowing the truth. I found it heartening that in 1977 a producer had the balls to air such truth in public. Not that it did much good. The ending where the president is gunned down and the only one to run to his side was his Aide showed the disdain of all the rest of his advisors and cabinet members for his desire to speak the truth. I imagine this bears some element of truth about presidential politics even today. It also showed that even the president is expendable if he doesn’t go along with the “agenda.” Our current and future presidents may want to avoid pissing off government and non-government organizations who might wish him (or her) to retire early. Different story. Greer’s book was published in 2014. Well worth a read ‘Megatron @Megatron_ron BREAKING: 🇺🇲🇾🇪 Yemen’s Houthi have shot down an American MQ-9 ‘Reaper’ drone above the city of Marib’ By their own count, this is the sixteenth MQ-9 Reaper Drone that they have shot down. At about $30 million a pop, you are talking about nearly half a billion dollars worth of Reapers turned to ash. Start cranking all the other associated costs and now you are talking well north of half a billion bucks. If they can do this, then it is only a matter of time until they get a luck hit on a Navy ship in the Red Sea. So what will Trump do then? Rage that he will unleash hell or some such? Offer to make a deal? If he can’t break tiny Yemen, than what makes him think that he can do so to Iran? Stephanie Kelton to debate Steve Moore April 16th, she gonna eat his lunch and snacks! Colorado River Water disappearing. Here I thought it was over-appropriation and use by humans. It’s the damned headwaters biomes! Blame the ecosystem, NOT the humans! I saw that too. All that freeloading, parasitic vegetation sucking up all that water which could used for almonds farms or whatever. I got an idea. They should spray Agent Orange all over that region and kill off all that lazy, unproductive vegetation so that all that water will have the freedom to flow unhindered to the Colorado river. Problem solved! An idea that Trump himself could be proud of. They’ve tried that already, the Mekong River. So, the Colorado “deforestation” campaign will be the Beta test? (Do they have Marmot Cong in Colorado?) Water is for lying over/Whiskey is for lying under: dept. The difference from Cali water and Colorado River water, is the latter allows for so much potential pilfering compared to the relatively short delivery span of aqua here-less chances of chicanery. Trump should impose tariffs on those free loading plants. Because it will make him feel better without actually doing harm to anyone or thing. It’s almost all orchards here in the southern San Joaquin Valley, and farmers & local officials of the far right persuasion refer to the pines that get first dibs on water in the higher climes as: ‘Straws’ I can just imagine those orchard owners looking up to all those pines while fingering a cigarette lighter in their pocket. There are an estimated 129 million dead trees in CA that are no longer water straws. But they are ready to burn. I remember reading that there is great concern that CA will have the most massive wildfire, ever, in the Sierra Nevada. Methinks the number is closer to 200 million newlydeads in the Sierra Nevada, and the 129 million number is from the 2012-16 drought. In the earlier epoch rarely did a pine above 7,500 feet succumb to the bark beetles, now its closer to a 9,000 foot ceiling for the die-off. It’s my contention that Bill Gates stays awake at night fretting about all those birds sleeping for free in his trees. The man really hates Nature. Maybe this would help him: “Mother Earth.” You laugh… The Tamarisk Hunters Canadians were clubbing the baby seals because seals ate their fish… Stabroek Block Oil reserves estimate of 11 Billion barrels… Hess believes more.

Legal update: CFPB spared, for now: https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5220651-federal-judge-trump-cfpb/ A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from effectively dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an early target of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson barred the administration from stopping work and firing employees at the CFPB and ordered the reinstatement of previously terminated workers. She also blocked the destruction of any CFPB records and ordered the recission (sic) of any “wholesale” contract cancellations issued on or after Feb. 11. However, USAID has met its fate. An Appeals court lifted a lower court’s TRO restraining and held that the Trump admin and Elon may proceed feeding it headfirst into the wood-chipper. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that social-media posts like Musk’s declaration that he “fed USAID into the wood chipper” didn’t legally prove he was making the orders. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/appeals-court-clears-way-for-doge-to-keep-operating-at-usaid/ar-AA1BRPGO Musk is feeding more than the agency into the wood chipper: The axing of some 10,000 programs has consigned untold numbers of children and refugees to death, officials say. https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-usaid-rubio-marocco-canceled-programs-gaza-syria-congo-hiv-ebola Are we 100% sure that all those programs are what they seem? USAID is a front for the CIA after all. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna While I’m not a fan of the chainsaw budget cutting, he might inadvertently be doing a lot of people a favor. Of course we can’t possibly be 100% sure. Is it 100% certain that the Guardian article is true? It’s clear, though, that the humanitarian programs exist and are crucial to the health and survival of many people around the world in poor countries, even if the CIA is involved in some cases. This is according to media reports, the UN, multiple private aid agencies, government officials, etc. Pretty sure these are actual programs that help people: S. Africa: USAID cuts could prompt over 500,000 HIV deaths https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420 and https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-trump-funding-pause-500-million-food-spoilage-risk/ “USAID plays a major role in coordinating earthquake assistance.” https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-notified-congress-intent-reorganize-usaid-rubio-says-2025-03-28/ There are many more examples. I doubt the CIA is involved in all of them. Why couldn’t the aid have been continued de-coupled from any spook activities? Axing all of them at once is unconscionable. But, Musk obviously doesn’t care about that and scored political points by doing so. It was probably the humanitarian programs in particular which upset Musk. A short critical German comment on USAID by Austrian Hannes Hofbauer (whose restrictive views on migration I e.g. do not share.) machine-translation from German NACHDENKSEITEN On the end of USAID: self-empowerment instead of external control https://archive.is/frJFL “(…) Development of underdevelopment Malaria: widespread. HIV: Africa’s hostage. Hunger: not eradicated. Since the term “development aid” was popularized in the 1960s, hopes have rested on it – in vain, as history shows. According to a UNICEF report, 733 million people worldwide were affected by hunger in 2023, 152 million more than four years previously. Africa leads the field, with a 20 percent increase in the number of hungry people. Since 2010, the number of undernourished people has also been rising sharply again – in sub-Saharan Africa from 18 percent to 23 percent.[ The entire paradigm of development aid – rich north helping poor south – has failed across the board. Honest aid workers can hardly admit this, and those who abuse it as an instrument to build political influence and economic outflow cling to it anyway, out of self-interest. (…) Through so-called partnership agreements, the EU has also opened markets to EU-European goods with over 30 African and Caribbean countries, driving local businesses, farmers, and fishermen to ruin. Their sons, deprived of their livelihoods, are drawn north, across the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to Europe. (…)” Of course within a huge structure through e.g. inertia some positive outcomes of any such opertion are not impossible. Just look at British or French colonial history. In fact to offer genuine aid bolsters any form of serious control. But the strategic relentless prerogative shouldn´t be denied. USAID reminds me a bit of philanthropy: People turn into billionaires by destroying the lives of millions ripping off entire countries. While at home using that profit they pay for cultural or social services to the benefit of a few hundred or thousand – admired by media. Like shooting off someone´s leg in order to steal his home but then getting him a wheel-chair for free under the eyes of the press. p.s. To clearify: An Elon Musk doesn´t care for the Global South any more than any EU-Commission member or Boeing. So the positive effects of USAID dismantled again are certainly not intended. I must admit to quite a bit of schadenfreude watching Musk whine about vandalism on his lots on Fox’s “The Five” this afternoon. Poor baby after taking a chainsaw to the lives of thousands. Otherwise, things are getting biblical. The SSA change that ends using phones for making changes to one’s SS account quickly became, in some news circles, a decree that all SS recipients come into the offices that are still open to prove their identity. Made it seem all Christmassy to me: “And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world…” Then to satisfy my curiosity about the UK’s breakdown, I watched this fellow get interviewed by the same hard right British “channel” as interviewed the frightening young fellow I linked several days ago. This guy, who was a Tory and UKIP member of Parliament for more than a decade, says that “being born in a stable doesn’t make you a horse.” He proposes that Britain should “remigrate” up to the second generation of descendants of immigrants back to the countries where their ancestors came from. In other words, if your grandpa came from Jamaica, even if legally, back you go. But this Mr. Carswell offers his advice not from a post in not-so-merry old England but from the American state of Mississippi where he is the CEO of some non-profit funded by somebody who shouldn’t be allowed to have money. So when I heard Carswell advocate for returning the first and second generation of British descendants of immigrants, legal or illegal, this sprung to mind: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me Crazy times. “Trump to Unveil Country-Based Tariffs April 2 in Rose Garden” Of course the whole thing is a shakedown. He is putting a tariff on every country that there is but I think that the real reason is so that he can extract economic concessions from them. I think that there are two or three demands that the Trump regime is making of Oz. One is to get rid of our PBS subsidized drugs so that Big Pharma can make big profits here like in the US but that is absolutely the third rail in Oz politics. Another is stranger. There is an attack on our Goods & Services tax here in Oz. In short, you buy something or pay for a service here, you have to pay a tax on it. The US is crying that it is an unfair tax but many States in the US do exactly that- https://theconversation.com/is-australias-gst-a-tax-or-a-tariff-and-why-has-it-become-a-target-in-the-trade-wars-250041 I think that the problem is that the US buys more from Oz than Oz buys from the US and Trump is upset by that. But there is a solution. The biggest export to the US by a country mile is gold which is why the imbalance. So I propose that we stop selling gold to the US. Immediately the deficit will run the other way, Trump is happy and I am pretty sure that Oz can find another country to sell our gold to. Anybody know the telephone area code for Beijing? AI is “running out of juice” (The Register) https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/14/ai_running_out_of_juice/ If you look closely at what Microsoft has been doing with AI, you’ll see that it’s pulling back in places some of us wouldn’t think to look. Microsoft has canceled more than a gigawatt of datacenter operations in addition to numerous 100-plus MW agreements. I’m old enough to remember when the “Juice” ran for 2003 yards, breaking Jim Brown’s NFL rushing record in the old Shea Stadium. Maybe AI must bring back “the Juice” for the man in the street? Regarding the ruckus about the USA moving airforce assets to Diego Garcia: “The media and some readers argued that Iran might not be able to reach Diego Garcia. Iran is signaling otherwise.” There is another hypothesis: those B2 & co bombers are not there to attack Iran, but to subdue Yemen. I agree with that hypothesis. I already commented here that I believe the USA first has to crush Yemen if a joint Israel-USA attack against Iran is really to take place: having Ansarallah capable of wreaking havoc in the rear is something that must be excluded for such an offensive to have any chance of success (and even then). The massive bombardments that are now taking place against Yemen (several dozens of attacks daily) show that the focus is on eliminating Ansarallah as a player able to lob missiles and drones at Israeli and American ships and bases in the region. If and when this is achieved, then the USA will be able to proceed with Iran. I see Iran has three Kilo-class submarine. Can you imagine what would happen if after the US launched an attack against Iran, that one of them surfaced near Diego Garcia and lobbed a few missiles into the airbase just as those planes were getting ready to land again? Just sink (or debilitate) US Navy oilers in random corners of the world. The US only has so many. even losing one makes things more complicated The US military has a logistical chain built on playdoh Not sure the Iranian Kilo boats have missile capability? RE: The Code That Controls Your Money I notice that it is written by someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC (paraphrasing): I can no longer see any way for a human to progress without harming another Which resonated then, and booms emptily more these days. a natural consequence of having 8+ billion people on the planet, and the politically incorrect observation that certain jurisdictions have 0, or negative, non-migration population growth while others don’t. PS, I hate the Club of Rome and their intellectual heirs I think that is a bit of a stretch, we (as a species) are bearing the consequences of earlier globalisations, destabilising previously stable populations. Do you enjoy being historically incorrect as much as politically? “someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC” I doubt it. The article states that Clive Thompson is a journalist who writes about science and technology and as far as I can remember, NakedCapitalism commentator Clive was a software engineer, not a journalist. Since the article talks about COBOL, let me add a few points. 1) Learning COBOL — or most other programming languages — is not that difficult. While this is the first obstacle to having programmers able to deal with those legacy systems, the other software components and libraries that those COBOL programs rely upon constitute a really big hurdle. I bet that many of those banking/financial/insurance COBOL programs make use of the services of such software systems as CICS and IMS — IBM technology from the 1960s to deal with transactions and databases. Yes, IBM is still maintaining all of it. This is something that is often forgotten: learning a programming language is not enough; one must be knowledgeable with a large set of external libraries, additional software components, and ancillary services to develop or maintain anything of value. This does not just affect COBOL; the situation is the same with modern programming languages (for instance, since they are mentioned in the article, Java, Python, JavaScript). 2) By the mid-1980s, development had moved from programming individual COBOL statements that invoke those auxiliary libraries and modules explicitly, to embedding some higher-level descriptions or instructions in the COBOL program that would then be processed and automatically transformed into the necessary COBOL code. For instance, one would insert a (properly tagged) SQL statement that would then be replaced by the necessary COBOL calls to the database management system. This was possible not just for database functions, but also for user interfaces, report writers, communications, etc. So when reading about the sheer amount of existing COBOL code, remember that a large fraction of it is not hand-coded, but automatically generated from other formalisms (at least from the late 1980s onwards). 3) Ah, the infamous “GOTO”! Two things: first, it is “GO TO” in COBOL, not “GOTO”. Second, the real killer in COBOL is the “ALTER” statement. I will not explain it, but suffices to say that our teacher of COBOL refused to explain its semantics, telling us to never use it, and that one of my colleagues once joked about making use of one such statement to make life “interesting” for future maintainers of the application he was developing. Disclaimer: I learned COBOL at the University, and developed in COBOL in the mid-1980s. What I remember is the hierarchy between application programmers and systems programmers. The systems guys were the high priests needed to make things work — they knew the inner workings of the OS. In my DoD days we had Ada as the language that would incorporate all the best software engineering ideas. Problem was it was competing with the private sector C and then C++/C# with OOA/OOP concepts and while DoD was important, thanks to the mini/micro revolution it wasn’t big enough to command things. Agree that much of the problem is a system engineering one. Interfacing systems, understanding and implementing APIs, testing interoperability. I guess Rust is coming on as the language de jour, with JSON and REST getting a lot of the web interfacing chores. Much respect, thanks for this comment. I was employed for about 5 years writing Javascript in my mid-30s back when the WWW was fairly new, after failing Comp Sci 101 in the 80s with punchcards. But I’ve always been fascinated by the history of computing. “Germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war” This could get interesting. I can just see the next general NATO meeting now and where the German representative stands up and says- ‘OK now. Just for the official record. So you want Germany to build up our military into a powerful force once more.’ Lots of nods. ‘Then you want German tank armies to go charging across the plains of Poland.’ More nods from the other NATO members. ‘Then you want the German army fighting the Russians in front of the gates of Moscow.’ Yet more nods. ‘And nobody sees a problem with any of this.’ The other NATO members then shake their heads. Lighten up,Kev. This is very much the age of looking forward,not back. Are you going to hold Baerbock and Baroness VDL to account for their descendants’ honourable sins forever? Then Mark Rutte says “I assume I’ll be getting a raise?” to many nods and whispers Wait,…did I just hear a champagne cork…? Annalena Baerbock (AB): Radek, why our all those new tanks you bought recently parked at our border? Radek Sikorski (RS): We wanted to protect them from the Russians. Hold them in reserve. AB: Ok, that makes sense but why are they all still pointing towards Germany? RS: It costs lots of fuel to even turn those big boys around so we just left them like that for now. But don’t worry, we can have them do a full 360 in a flash. AB: Thanks for the reassurance. Do you think you could lend us a few attack helicopters. I read you bought a bunch of those recently too. RS: Sorry, no. AB: Are you still planning to do a joint build with South Korea of fighter jets in Poland? RS: Sorry, can’t discuss that. Do you need some old MIG’s? AB: No, I hate anything Russian. RS: Well, at least we have that in common. Good luck. But isn’t there also a history of Germany forcing overthrow of the Russian government followed by civil war? Only when the Romanovs were still in charge, right? Never even close since then. Rev Kev that is pure comedy! RE:The Senescence Loop What do you expect from a lamarckian process?

Heaven knows my predictive powers are at best crummy; I have predicted 10 out of the last 2 bear markets. This is the point in time where, in the past, Ben Bernanke or Greenspan would have dropped a surprise 50bps rate drop on the market, effectively nuking “Da Bears” from low Earth orbit. But this ain’t 2007 or 1998, so perhaps we are going to see this stinking market crater into oblivion. When CNBC puts up the “Markets in Crisis” banner that’s time to buy. In the hundred daze campaign by our Tettotalitarian Leader, he’s done everything to alienate anybody left that still has a scintilla of sense, and they’re all tied to us via the almighty buck, yuck.

Adios hegemony~ Don’t even want to bring up Hiroshima & Nagasaki, but we’re zeroing in on the fourth turning there, too. I have a bad feeling about this, to quote Indiana Jones. There will be some rip-your-face-off countertrend rallies in the coming bear market, to be sure. But it’s clear to me that AI has come a cropper, and deglobalization won’t come easily. Predatory late-stage capitalism doesn’t have a reverse gear … that means driving us all off a cliff is the endgame. Can you imagine various European nations recommending their citizenry to have 72 hours worth of rations on hand, in late August of 1939? That’s the feel of goings on, prepping for 3 days-not 2,200 days. I just assumed that was a form of narrative building, i.e. “evil Russkies, mama!” meant to scare the locals into a docile and subservient position. My operating assumption is that WWIII has already begun. But to your point, the notion that it will all be over in 72 hours, and then we can to back to our regularly scheduled episodes of “Real Housewives of the ATL” is rather comical. More likely, it will play out like “The Walking Dead.” BTW, error noted – Han Solo said “I have a bad feeling about this” not Indiana Jones. Quite true that- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogIuFclGE8 (1:52 mins) Yes. “It’s a trap!” The German title for Don Siegel´s “Madigan” was – “Nur noch 72 Stunden” / “72 hours left” The German title for Paul Haggis´s remake “The Next Three Days” was – “72 Stunden – The next three days” The German title for Javier Gutiérrez´s “Tres Dias” was – “72 Stunden – nur noch 3 Tage” Germans seem to have a math problem. So if you bring in 2,200 days that´s not gonna end well. Total confusion. By total I mean – a “One thousand” – kind of confusion. (“360-degrees-syndrom” also made in Germany) p.s. as Ian Proud is concerned – that was an April 1st prank by him on us In the UK, many families don’t have the next meal on hand and our government just doesn’t care. Now that more working class and middle class families find their earners trapped in the gig economy, they are beginning to rely on food banks rather than making donations to them. And when the middle class feel the bite of hunger and the threat of permanent impoverishment for their offspring, that’s when the need for real political reform takes shape in their minds and they take the first faltering steps towards reality. I think we are reaching the position where Farage will make a real breakthrough and Reform becomes a broad enough church to win the next election. It might be a good idea to have a government relying on a parliamentary majority consisting of people with little or no political experience who have become politicians out of necessity because they’ve given up hope in the existing order and not because it is a good career choice for someone on the make. But as with other countries in Europe, will the British establishment allow new politicians into power or find creative ways to block them? “Taiwan accuses Chinese chipmakers of illegally poaching engineers” Maybe that story is not so simple. Maybe those Taiwanese bosses told some of their engineers that they have a new assignment for them. That they will be sent to the US to go work in setting up a new chipmaking foundry there. And those engineers sat down after work in a bar sharing their thoughts. Working and living in America would be a great experience. Doing the same in Trump America may be not so much. Even Canadians are avoiding traveling there and the number of ways that you can fall afoul of law enforcement/ICE/FBI, etc. is legion. On the other hand they can actually see China from their office windows. You could work there and see family every weekend. They talk the same language and have the same customs. For any Taiwanese engineer that would be a great temptation and it is not like Taiwan values its workers that much. The headline just seems to conjure images of Chinese poachers, dressed in Ghillie suits, stalking the streets of Taipei and darting unsuspecting engineers with trank guns, then dragging their unconscious forms off to Shanghai. I suppose that even works as a resurrection of the old verb “shanghai,” right?

I’ve no idea what a useful path forward may be but does not seem like an ideal time to go to sleep. Crazy that we’re losing a debate on the merits of the Magna Carta in 2025. Seems like only yesterday this anti-Due Process crowd was livid over cancel culture. “Trump Administration Targets Harvard With Review of $9 Billion in Federal Funding ” My take is that Big Ed, much like DEI-wokeworld made a lot of enemies and alienated almost all potential allies. Now the Republicans in power are going to smack them around a bit. It’s a cheap giveaway to some of their allies with the bonus of dinging what has become a power base for the Democrats. Perhaps they can keep Harvard going with plasma donations in the i.v. league, er mobile blood donation vans? Unfortunately, I think this is a significant factor. And it’s nothing new. George Wallace used to slap “pointy-headed liberals” around a lot with much success, and conservatives have been making fun of obscure research projects by academics forever. And liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped. Many people who do not live their lives in academic bubbles or education-adjacent PMC enclaves do not see the world the same way and will not connect the necessary dots. I was very sympathetic toward that Rutgers Resolution for the Big Ten schools, but I doubt if that would be the case for the broader public. Now if Trump were to slap a 25 percent tariff on football tickets or alumni donations to athletic programs, well that would be a whole new ball game – so to speak. (See, I can’t even keep myself from being condescending!) Not a fan of “liberal condescension toward the deplorables” but having been born in the Heartland and moved to the coastal cities as an adult I find the crying about condescension to be hypocritical at best. Mostly it seems like projection. Much like the GOP cries of “groomers” when every week another is busted for worse. Anecdotal but the only times I’ve ever had a gun pointed at me were by the NYPD (lived in a latino neighborhood and police raids were common) and in the heartland by a guy who didn’t like my “fruity” look. Also while in Texas on a film production had a local in a cowboy hat and AR-15 graphic t-shirt threaten to “kick my Hollywood p-ssy -ss” for enforcing on-set mask mandates back in 2020. I could list numerous other examples of Heartland values I’ve experienced that 25+ years of NYC/LA living have avoided but won’t for brevity. I’ll just say that I’ve lived in city neighborhoods often deemed dangerous yet have never had threats or issues in these places like I have experienced in small town America. So, for some of us, not seeing “the world the same way” is why we prefer the very flawed world view of coastal elites. Yeah, I got turned down for a job because they didn’t want to hire a cis white guy (was surprised they actually said that!) but they’ve never pulled a gun or threatened to beat me. Every so often I scroll through the threads on Truth Social, Rumble, and Gettr to get a glimpse of the conservative cultural landscape. Similarly will browse Bluesky and Mastadon for liberal ones. The liberal platforms are very PMC Russia-gate delusions of being one lawsuit and Sorkin speech away from mimosa brunch utopia. The conservative ones are a descent into violent civil war fantasies, gun fetishists, replacement theory rantings, and dreams of putting women back in their place. Both are crazy but only one is wishing for a new Crusades. Personally, as a person and an artist, I try to find ways to bridge divides and wish that was a more common approach. So, yeah, maybe “liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped” and maybe wokeness was annoying but back in 1946 Superman was shown punching Klansmen (the original idPol activists) and that was considered a good thing. Now are we supposed to just accept there are “good people on both sides” because the Heartland might get offended if we say such things are bad? What (if any) critique of so-called small town values is acceptable? Or is “this” only an acceptable mantra for one side? I have dual citizenship: rural Illinois and west coast port city. In my boonies the condescension is noticed and leaves a mark. President Garber’s official letter to the Harvard Community. Harvard has $55 billion endowment, more than enough to tell Trump to pound sand. F*cking cowards. Dear Members of the Harvard Community, Earlier today, the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism issued a letter putting at risk almost $9 billion in support of research at Harvard and other institutions, including hospitals in our community. If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation. The government has informed us that they are considering this action because they are concerned that the University has not fulfilled its obligations to curb and combat antisemitic harassment. We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry. Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus. I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university. For the past fifteen months, we have devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism. We have strengthened our rules and our approach to disciplining those who violate them. We have enhanced training and education on antisemitism across our campus and introduced measures to support our Jewish community and ensure student safety and security. We have launched programs to promote civil dialogue and respectful disagreement inside and outside the classroom. We have adopted many other reforms, and we will continue to combat antisemitism and to foster a campus culture that includes and supports every member of our community. We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission. Much is at stake here. In longstanding partnership with the federal government, we have launched and nurtured pathbreaking research that has made countless people healthier and safer, more curious and more knowledgeable, improving their lives, their communities, and our world. But we are not perfect. Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends—and to the teaching and research at the heart of our University—will not waver. Sincerely, Alan M. Garber Cowards indeed. They should have stood up on the hind legs when the slavering Elise Stefanik went after the college presidents. And that was when Biden was president, and I don’t remember that he objected to it at all. And not many other Democrats either. And from the letter, you can see that these universities have bought in 100% to the new definition of “antisemitism”. Really tired of all the liberal mewling about everything that’s going down right now, and then watching them do nothing at best, or help Trump along at worst (Thanks Chuckie!)

IMO you win the internet for the day. There must surely be groups collecting and breaking down which institutes across the country get cut down. And which do not. Just like nobody touching DoD. So I am waiting for Taibbi/Kirn to address that eventually… If protest won´t be supported at some point by institutions, i.e. party structures, unions, academia, churches the current movement won´t have any effect. Which I assume will be the case. Our Western societies have become so affluent that any serious urge to change has disappeared under the too many layers of wealth still entitled to by too many. If I am reading the news correctly, Trump intends to bomb Iran, seize Greenland, fight Venezuela, repel a Chinese takeover of Taiwan, continue the fight in Ukraine, and back Israeli genocide in gaza while bombing Somalia. Has he decided to go to war with everyone and see how it shakes out? Dude you missed Canada! Now our feelings are hurt, eh? And win the Nobel Peace Prize! On his own nomination! And tariff everyone on top of that. ‘vitrupo @vitrupo Instead of learning how to code, Replit CEO Amjad Masad says “learn how to think, learn how to break down problems, learn how to communicate clearly.” Is there an accreditation for this?

Thailand Says Collapsed Bangkok Tower Used Substandard Steel Bloomberg. The latest news I’ve seen is that four senior staff of the Chinese company that was the main construction partner have been arrested for (allegedly) trying to remove records from the site. I doubt if this could have been caused by substandard steel, even if it was used. A quick google indicates that the construction of the tower has been very troubled, with lots of delays. This can be highly problematic in building construction as there can be break in the ‘knowledge’ trail due to changes in staff/contractors after an unplanned pause, and if a building is left exposed you can have unexpected deterioration in structural fittings that were never intended to be exposed to the elements. For example, concrete has been laid, its very difficult to test if it was done correctly in the first place, and a pressurised sub-contractor may just assume that it had been done to legal standards by the previous contractor. As one engineer who had a business fixing concrete rot once said to me – ‘a good paper trail is not a guarantee of good concrete’. But it could have been just bad luck with timing, depending on the construction design. The basic frame may have been in place before stressing cross-braces were put in place, or the foundation may still have been open to allow ground works, before everything was concreted over. For the most part, most building codes apply to the finished building, not an interim structure (I confess to knowing zero about Thai construction codes, except that they are much weaker than most western countries, but substantially better than most poorer Asian countries). Construction here is not very good. Air conditioners do not have filters. Toilets do not have traps. Many tall-ish buildings do not have steel frames (there is a term of art, which I forget, but one floor is built on pillars, and then the next floor is built on top of that). And that’s before getting to the ability to make payments to smooth bureaucratic obstacles. Reinforced concrete framing, otherwise known as “Pancake Stacks.” We have a lot of reinforced concrete framing here in Uruguay, but we don’t have earthquakes. I really don’t think that the structures themselves are deficient, but that they tend to pancake during earthquakes. I remember the freeway that pancaked in San Francisco in the World series earthquake of 1989, Loma Prieta lazy load-bearing walls and earthquakes don’t mix….and it’s unfortunate that, like many parts of Asia and other parts of the world, the local authorities can’t codify safe practices which literally arose from the body count of early-industrial age (see Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire) Article mentions “steel bars” suggesting rebar, but maybe this is a translation thing and it’s structural steel forms. Reminds me of the 1031 Canal (Hard Rock Hotel) collapse in New Orleans in 2019 (I was there at the time). Seems like the design was fingered as the culprit. Or the FIU bridge collapse where the construction team changed the design without going back to the designers. I’ve been wading through Marc Andreesen’s “Techno optimists Manifesto”, Nick Land’s “Dark Enlightenment” and some of “Mencius Moldbug’s” writings. Their plan seems to have three parts. !) Destroy American Civil Society. 2) After a period of Civil unrest and Martial law which will “Right Size” the population, impose the Technate. 3) Paradise! I have few doubts that the first part will succeed, it is well underway and I see little opposition to date. The assumption that Civil unrest and “Right sizing” the population is going to be controllable seems unrealistic. And the assumption that our Techlords will be the only ones attempting to fill that political vacuum seems to ignore groups such as the Mormon Church, which is a State within the State. There are others… “If everything goes as planned” ignores the fact that Murphy always shows up at the party, invited or not. It won’t be boring. No kidding. These geniuses (genii?) possessing neither a drop of empathy nor any understanding of how humans work really think they can make this happen. Sure, they’ll just impose themselves on the populace whether the rabble likes it or not. They seriously can’t conceive of anyone opposing the gift of enlightenment they would bring. Certainly not any churches, organized crime groups, unions, militias (right, left and non-partisan), ethnic communities, rural communities, National Guard units who remained loyal to their states, etc. As someone said the other day, I’ve never seen a successful oligarchy with this many unemployed snipers around. They’ll learn too late why we went to the trouble to build civil society in the first place. It’s like ol’ Mencius was too busy trying on leather jackets for his photo ops to pick up a book on the Thirty Years War (which loomed large in the minds of the founders, I can assure everyone).

Enjoy. https://www.idcommunism.com/2025/04/russia-after-95-years-on-public-display-lenins-body-will-be-laid-to-rest-in-ulyanovsk.html Here is probably the best one I have run across today. If you look at the title of the very first podcast in the list. The eyebrow-raiser – Dr. Ehrman actually was very much involved in the presentation of The Gospel of Judas to the public twenty or so years ago, and that was anything but a hoax. So, there is some ring of credibility there which made the joke all the more gripping. If you are interested, the entire podcast from today’s April Fool’s festivities was all about the most important hoaxes and forgeries of gospels and other Christian documents. It was actually quite enlightening. Just FYI, I have been reading and studying the Ancient Greek and Latin for decades. All of the ancient classical library of Greece and Rome and all of the Christian documents. Dr. Ehrman, of Duke University, an avowed atheist, is by far and away the best teacher and study guide for those interested in the koine Greek Christian canon. I always leave his lectures with more questions than answers. https://www.bartehrman.com/podcast/ An oldie but a goodie. A lot of people believed this was a true story at the time, including other news outlets not noticing it was in the April 1st edition of Sports Illustrated. / ;) https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/10/15/curious-case-sidd-finch via RACKET Another good doc-video on protest, by Ford Fischer / News2Share Protesters face off outside Tesla dealerships nationwide over Elon Musk’s “DOGE” 15 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkWwS4OE-0 The problem: If this is First Amendment the First Amendment is a joke. It´s a worthless token offered to the protest rabble to give them the feeling that they actually can do something. Which they can´t. In fact it´s an expression as it is a cover for and of total and utter powerlessness. Everyone doing some idiotic thing in public apparently invokes the First. The First provides the right to be a moron. Wow. Very helpful. That´s almost like protest against “the right” in Germany. Completely worthless. I doubt these people would be protesting in front of BMW or GM. Though those companies do not cause less destruction on the planet. Or of course take any multi. They say Musk. But they ought to say capitalism. But capitalism has again become the sacred cow of Jane and John Doe. Long live the First International. Oh? Is that why govt worked/works so hard to silence certain voices and threads via NGO cutout organizations? Because the 1st is a joke? Riiight…. I am all in for the First. And I am abhorred over what is going on in Germany (the only case I can judge). And I will always defend it. BUT: The fact that there is free speech – whatever its limits in Europe e.g. – what´s it worth? Did it stop us from inching towards WWIII? Does it stop a genocide committed as openly as ever? Does free speech stop the destruction of free speech on campuses in the US? Will it stop the destruction of labour via AI? Will it stop the increased concentration of capital? Will it stop climate “change”? I do for instance believe labour unions can achieve a few of these things. But when labour will in fact endanger the ruling order it will clash violently with state and corporate power. I.e. that labour will have to act well beyond the rights granted by free speech and arm itself. In the face of material force free speech in itself is worthless. That´s what facsism means. When free speech does threaten ruling power only on the surface you already can see what happens. They will use a tiny bit of judicial force to stop it. What if you push further? What if all BSW-voters in Germany had gone to the street and would have demanded a recount of the votes? What if protesters storm the US nuclear storage at Büchel base in Germany? Freedom of speech – or lets say diplomacy – did not help the Russians in preempting a war with 1.3M KIA on both sides. As Capone says in THE UNTOUCHABLES “With a gun and a nice word you achieve more than just a nice word.” What is free speech worth if we dare not question the capitalist structure underneath it? What is free speech worth if we have no means to enforce it against the state? What is free speech worth if the people who have the means to push for political change are so brain-washed that they in fact support the above mentioned WWIII policies or a genocide. Naturally this is a polemic comment and I am putting forward talking points which I still do not believe but I must contend with current realities. It is also a very personal reaction to the political fallout which we have experienced since 2024 in particular. As the necessity to resist couldn´t be more obvious. But never have we been further away from a viable political opposition with the Left – that usually held up that option – completely in tatters, or better, paid off. I am not argueing that we have completely run out of options with the use of free speech rights. But right now I am pessimistic it will in fact change anything beyond the cosmetic level. p.s. In his latest podcast Doug Henwood had two regulars as guests to his show. They spoke about the PMC. Henwood being Henwood I need not go into further detail. But there was this one point: The guests suggested that one reason for a possible demise of the genuine left originating in the 1960s was the idea of many academics then to change the system from the inside and decided to enter the system – after – and this is the interesting part – coming to the conclusion that the protest did not seriously end Vietnam but changes within the system did. I don´t know about the evidence for that. It´s complicated to prove any such point. Much of it being smart PR by pseudo-leftists I would suspect. I have all my life been in favour of protest. And I have always been of the opinion that protest (i.e. the First) did end Vietnam. But comments like this make me think. Especially if a Daniel Ellsberg 2 years ago mused that may be it was not the protest that brought down Nixon, not his own Pentagon Paper leaks and not a seminal SCOTUS decision “NYT & Co vs. US” – but a Howard Dean.

Prosecutors directed to seek death penalty against UnitedHealthcare killing suspect Luigi Mangione AP “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statement. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” And thus are Martyrs made. “Brian Thompson—an innocent man” Only because he was never charged for his crimes. The wealthy sins and mistakes, which all need forgiveness, while the poor have crimes and sins, which are unforgivable and require punishment. Money really does wash away one’s guilt. It may have “shocked” the powers that be and the oligarchs in charge, but down here on the ground “shocked” isn’t the word I’d use to describe the reaction.

And they couldn’t even cover their tracks? Amateurs, mere amateurs. Sigh. There is a lot to say and the case is still developing. But French law is pretty strict on the financing of political parties, and there have been a number of similar prosecutions in recent years. Former President Sarkozy, already convicted of fiddling election expenses, is on trial for receiving campaign contributions from Libya amounting to millions of Euros, at least. But the point here is not the crime (which is pretty well established) but the punishment. The judge had a great deal of discretion in the punishment awarded, and opted for the harshest available: disqualification with immediate effect, even while an appeal is being mounted. That means that Le Pen cannot present herself in 2027, it means that the party itself probably won’t be able to find another candidate, and that the whole complexion of French politics has just been altered by one judge who could easily have awarded a sentence that was less harsh. Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence. >”Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence.” Which does confirm a Walter Kirn (sorry to bother with him who is no expert on foreign affairs) who I have criticized just yesterday for alluding to this very problem. I cross-posted this with yesterdays article on not accepting or sending checks for US taxes… Holy mackerel! I was reviewing the US Treasury’s Daily Statement trying to get a picture of tax inflows from tariffs from a before perspective. While I was reviewing it I came across 2 line items that when viewed together shocked me… (fiscal year to date numbers)… inflows/deposits to the Treasury… Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Electronic $164,358M Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Other $126,061M These line items relate to taxes paid by individuals that were not withheld from payroll or collected in advance for other reasons… the money owed after you complete your return if you did not receive a refund. While I’m not 100% confident I have identified the best/fullest answer, but from what I’ve been able to glean the difference between Electronic and Other is tied to whether you filed your return electronically of via paper where “Other” is primarily paper filed returns. I’d suspect they call it Other because it likely also includes legal judgements regardless of your original type of filing. While it is technically possible to file on paper and pay electronically via the IRS web portal, I would highly suspect the correlation is that paper filings include a paper check! At least at the dollar level, the ratio is 1 : .75. That’s a lot of paper checks (or their dollar equivalent) to force to electronic payment in the next 6 months or so! While I do suspect some of those paper returns & checks are very high dollar value, I still think it directionally points to a significant volume of people who are paying their taxes in paper check form (or equivalent such as a money order). Don’t know, but like lots of people without W-2 income or mandatory 1099 withholding I make estimated tax payment by check throughout the year. I did notice my 15 Jan check processed by Cincinnati came back as “converted to ACH”. Think that’s a first. Hope Hawaii doesn’t jump on this bandwagon. We pay some business taxes. They keep raising the tax so for one period we got fined for exceeding the dollar limit where you have to file electronically. So now we file electronically but the limit for mandatory electronic payment is higher (and with “convenience fee”) so we still pay by check. Had a three-month span where we were getting dinged for non-payment. Had to call and fax copies of the cleared checks (thankfully, not converted to ACH so you can still get an image of front/back of actual check). No, I’m not going to Zelle my IRS payment. re: Germany vs. Gaza Germany Turns to U.S. Playbook: Deportations Target Gaza War Protesters Objections from a top immigration official that none of the protesters were convicted of crimes were overruled amid political pressure. https://theintercept.com/2025/03/31/germany-gaza-protesters-deport/ A question for the commentariat: What are the power centers in the America of today?

Title: As Future of Panama Canal Hangs in Balance, Mexico Quietly Begins Testing Its Interoceanic Rail Corridor
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/04/as-future-of-panama-canal-hangs-in-balance-mexico-quietly-inaugurates-its-interoceanic-rail-corridor.html

Full Content:
South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just became the first company to use the rail corridor, which is being touted as a possible plan B to the embattled canal. Just a few weeks ago, the Trump Administration was celebrating what seemed to be an early strategic victory over China in the US’ direct neighbourhood. As readers may recall, a consortium led by the investment fund manager BlackRock had just announced its purchase of 80 percent of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port holdings, giving the consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, including, crucially, the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal. The sale of CK Hutchison’s ports business put “the ports [in Panama] under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane,” noted an Associated Press article. The message was clear: the Trump Administration is not going to stand by and watch as China expands its influence in the US’s own “backyard”, especially over strategic assets like the Panama Canal. To put this in broader context, the attempted buy out of the Panamanian ports came just three months after the opening of the Chinese-financed and -managed deep sea port in Chancay, which as Asia Times reported, signalled “the start of a new era of efficient, high-capacity shipping between China and Peru, with a connection to Brazil across the Andes.” As a measure of Chancay’s importance to the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping even travelled to Peru to inaugurate the mega port (as well as attend the 31st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Lima), where he said: “We are witnessing not only the solid and successful joint implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in Peru, but also the birth of a new land-maritime corridor between Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean in a new era.” Of course, this caused all sort of teeth gnashing in Washington, especially given that Chancay is more advanced than any seaport in the US. Within weeks, US officials were signing a strategic agreement with Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa government that allows the US to install military personnel, weapons and other equipment on the Galapagos islands, a UNESCO Natural Heritage Site in a country whose constitution expressly prohibits the establishment of foreign military bases. The island chain is 1,900 kms from Chancay. Since its inauguration, Trump 2.0 has upped the stakes, showing a clear willingness to use every conceivable tactic, including gangster extortion, to stymie Chinese influence on the American continent, particularly in Mexico and Central America. As Conor recently reported, the Trump administration’s obsession with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure extends beyond the American continent: Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. “Selling Out” the Chinese People Against this complex backdrop, the BlackRock-led consortium’s purchase of CK Hutchison’s port holdings (outside of China and Hong Kong) was set to be consummated with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction by April 2 — that is, tomorrow. But that, alas, will not be happening, at least not any time soon, since Beijing has decided that it, too, can play dirty on the global chessboard. Last week, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said it plans to “review [the sale] in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. As the FT reports, the move came on the back of earlier commentary in the Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, that called the sale a “spineless, grovelling” move that “sells out all Chinese people”. The agreement “in principle” was announced in early March, with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction expected by April 2. However, this is now set to be delayed, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yesterday, the newspaper featured comments from Hong Kong politicians and Chinese lawyers urging the CK Hutchison to rethink the sale of its ports division, which is kind of ironic given that the main point of the sale was to “de-risk” its port holdings. Now, it is caught in the middle of a bitch fight between the world’s two superpowers, for which it has already paid a heavy price. Since news of Beijing’s objections to the sale broke on March 13, the company’s shares have fallen 13%, retracing more than half of the 25% gain after the deal’s announcement. One Ta Kung Pao editorial even suggested that the sale could contravene Hong Kong’s national security laws, known as Article 23. If, as the FT notes, the deal were ultimately blocked, it could have major repercussions not only for Beijing’s already troubled relations with Hong Kong’s business elite but also Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre: CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing and his family, has increasingly been caught between Beijing and Washington over the Panama ports since US President Donald Trump complained of Chinese influence over the canal and said the US would be “taking it back”. It is unusual for a Chinese state agency to review a deal involving a Hong Kong-based company. CK Hutchison’s holding company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the conglomerate’s ports in China are excluded from the sale. “Is this a warning shot to others or a look to scuttle this deal?” one person familiar with the deal said. “On paper, the SAMR reviewing how this deal affects the Chinese shipping industry under its anti-monopoly mandate makes a lot of sense. But does anyone really believe that or is this . . . the Chinese scuttling a deal which will then have ramifications on Hong Kong as a financial centre?” “Torpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser at the IMF. “The risks are so high for all involved.” The End of the Belt-and-Road in Panama The deal represented a triumph for the Trump Administration’s geostrategic aspirations in its own neighbourhood as well as a blow to China’s belt-and-road project, given that some 6% of global trade passes through the canal. According to the US International Trade Commission, the Canal “has 46% of the total market share of containers moving from Northeast Asia to the East Coast of the United States.” Panama itself was the first country in Latin America to join China’s Belt-and-Road initiative, in 2017. However, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, under pressure from US Sec of State Marco Rubio, recently said he would withdraw Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review. The CK Hutchison deal was also supposed to mark a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions. According to Bloomberg, Fink had personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The billionaire CEO reportedly boasted of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. But apparently not in Beijing. For Trump, the deal was all about “reclaiming” the canal for the United States — a message that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not gone down well in Panama. This is a country wearily accustomed to US military interventions, the last of which took place in 1989 with George H W Bush’s invasion and toppling of Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama’s strong arm dictator (1983-9) and former CIA asset and go-between during the US’ dirty wars in Central America. Much like Saddam Hussein a few years later, Noriega thought he could go his own way. Trump has repeatedly denounced that US ships pay exorbitant prices to transit the waterway, though they, in fact, pay the same rates as ships of any other flag. But the deal is now on ice anyway, meaning that other options, including military ones, are back on the table. US-Style “Partnering” With Panama Even before Chinese regulators put the stick in the spokes, the Trump Administration had already directed the US military to draw up plans to increase the American troop presence in Panama, according to information leaked to NBC. As the NBC article notes, the amount of military force used will depend on the extent to which Panama is willing to, ahem, “partner” with the US: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Trump seems to believe that the US has, at the very least, joint, if not full, ownership rights over the canal due to the fact that the US government and banks financed its construction between 1904 and 1914. What happened just before 1904 is often forgotten or overlooked, however. The veteran US journalist Ken Silverstein jogged a few memories in his 2014 article for Vice, : “In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia into handing over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them JP Morgan & Co, which was appointed as the country’s ‘fiscal agent’ in charge of managing $10m in aid that the US had rushed down to the new nation.” US interests were myriad: on the one hand, Washington wanted access to, and control over, the canal that French builders had begun but failed to finish in the 1880s. At the same time, Wall Street banks were keen to create a new nation that would primarily serve their interests. As John Pilger reported for The Guardian in 2016, it was JP Morgan that would lead the American banks in gradually transforming Panama into “a financial centre – and a haven for tax evasion and money laundering – as well as a passage for shipping.” Washington maintained control of the interoceanic waterway until 1977 during which time when then-US President Jimmy Carter signed with the then Panamanian leader, Omar Torrijos, the cession of US control of the facility 22 years later. The agreement came after years of protests in Panama against US occupation but was widely criticised by US conservatives at the time and is seen by Trump as a “serious mistake.” But the Panama Canal has lost some of its lustre since the jungle country suffered an unprecedented drought in 2023. As we noted a few weeks ago, the BlackRock-led consortium’s participation in the canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). As Tom Neuburger wrote in a Jan 2024 article we cross-posted here, the plans to “fix” the Canal sound like plans to “fix” the climate: Bill Gates-style high tech fantasies. [Bloomberg] “In the long term, the primary solution to chronic water shortages will be to dam up the Indio River and then drill a tunnel through a mountain to pipe fresh water 8 kilometers (5 miles) into Lake Gatún, the canal’s main reservoir.” That’s a $2 billion project if it comes in on budget. But is it a long-term fix? Bloomberg admits that Panama “will need to dam even more rivers to guarantee water through the end of the century.” Sounds like Band-Aids to me. Lots of them. And residents of the to-be-flooded land are vigorously opposed, so it will be a political fight to move them. “Another potential fix is decidedly more experimental … cloud seeding, the process of implanting large salt particles into clouds to boost the condensation that creates rain.” The article is not optimistic that this will work. Another Gatesian dream: Pretty. Impossible. Or to say that differently, pretty impossible. Plan B Option: Mexico? As the future of the Panama Canal hangs in the balance, Mexico has begun pilot testing the Interoceanic Rail Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (also known by its Spanish initials, CIIT). On Friday, a ship chartered by the Hyundai Motor Company docked at the Pacific port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca. Its cargo, 600 Hyundai vehicles, were unloaded and placed on a freight train that then set off across the Isthmus, Mexico’s narrowest land bridge, to the port of Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, where the cargo was loaded onto another boat destined for the US’ East Coast. And just like that, the first genuine rival route, or perhaps better put, complementary route, to the Panama Canal was born. Or perhaps better put, reborn. You see, most of the infrastructure for the project was built over a century ago. In fact, the 188-mile railroad joining the two main ports was opened in 1907, seven years before the inauguration of the Panama Canal, and within no time was plying as many as 60 trains a day carrying things like sugar from the Caribbean on their way to the US West Coast. But its success was short lived. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the railroads were increasingly used to transport weapons and troops rather than freight. Four years later, the Panama Canal opened, offering a more attractive route to international businesses. Gradually, over time Mexico’s interoceanic railroad system fell into disrepair, and while recent governments in Mexico have talked about rebooting the system, it wasn’t until Andrés Manuel López Obrador (aka AMLO) took power in 2018 that the words actually turned into action. As we reported in September 2023, if completed and done well, it will probably represent the most important infrastructure project of Lopéz Obrador’s presidency. The goal is not just to turn Mexico into a logistics powerhouse but also to spread wealth across the country by boosting economic opportunities in Mexico’s poorer, long-neglected southern states (Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, etc). This will largely be through the development of ten industrial parks, or so-called “free zones”, along the route. The project will also include the construction of four new highways, three airports, a gas pipeline and a fibre-optic network, and already boasts a ten-stop passenger train service. As the problems stack up in Panama, other interoceanic land routes are coming under consideration, including a rival canal in neighbouring Nicaragua, which almost got built instead of the Panama Canal at the turn of the 20th century, as well as interoceanic rail corridors in Honduras and Colombia. But for the moment Mexico’s CIIT has one clear advantage over all these other projects: it is close to completion, and that is largely thanks to all the work undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “An Exceptional Project” While the journey time of the CIIT (6-7 hours) is slightly shorter than the Panama Canal (8-10 hours), you also have to add in the time it takes to load and unload thousands of shipping containers off a ship onto a train and then back on to a ship at the other end. According to a video report by the Wall Street Journal in September last year, “Mexico still has a lot of work to do to get its ports ready for a large influx of cargo”. This was a point that President Sheinbaum herself addressed in her Monday morning press conference: “Several very important cranes are about to arrive. There will also be a storage facility for grains that is also important, and other actions to strengthen the port of Salina Cruz and that will allow freer movement. It is an exceptional project that provides an alternative to the Panama Canal, and when the port of Salina Cruz is complete, it will have much more activity.” The total transit time for the Hyundai cargo was around 72 hours, according to local sources. Granted, this was the first pilot test carried out with a large cargo of vehicles but it still compares unfavourably with the Panama Canal — unless of course one takes into account the possible waiting times for ships before passage through the canal, which during periods of low rain can mean days or even weeks of hanging around off Panama’s coastline. During the 2023 drought, waiting times reached as long as 14 days, leaving some carriers little choice but to bid millions in extra fees to jump the line. Another advantage of the CIIT for a shipment from, say, South Korea to New York is that you wouldn’t have to go all the way down to Panama, navigate the canal and then go all the way back up again. Also, the long-term goal of Mexico’s interoceanic rail corridor is to bring the journey time down to low double or even single-digit figures as the logistics systems at the two ports gain in efficiency. According to the WSJ report, it should ultimately take around 15 hours for cargos to pass through Mexico. But as Mexican journalist Agustín García Villa notes, the success of a project of this scale and grandeur will require many things, including a trained workforce, technology, super-rapid processing of containers at the ports (which is good for all businesses, including, of course, drug trafficking ones), reliable energy sources, and the development of properly urbanised mid-sized cities that guarantee an adequate supply of housing, schools, hospitals, health centres, energy and markets. It will also depend on the amount of security Mexico’s marines can provide to the strategic infrastructure. All of that, in turn, will require a steady flow of significant investment as well as long-term political commitment. The former is, for the moment, amply covered, with money coming in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. Put simply, big business, not just from the US, wants this project to happen. So, too, does the Claudia Sheinbaum government, which took over the reins of power from AMLO last October. Ultimately, as the WSJ report concludes, Mexico’s re-emerging interoceanic rail corridor is unlikely to rival Panama Canal in terms of capacity or speed of transit even once complete. But it could serve as a very useful complement. As Doctor Yasmine Sabri, associate professor of logistics at University College London, tells the WSJ, rather than competing with each other, perhaps the two could work together by sharing data, enabling them to reroute vessels whenever there is a chokepoint, whether it is in Panama or Mexico. However, big questions still remain. For instance, how much opposition will the construction of industrial parks in Oaxaca and Veracruz face from local indigenous communities? If there is strong resistance, how will the Sheinbaum government respond? Like AMLO before her, Sheinbaum prides herself on representing indigenous rights and voices. It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project as and when it gradually comes on line. Of course, Trump will have somewhat more difficulty bullying Mexico into submission than it did Panama, but it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention. Will Chinese companies be interested in investing in the industrial parks along the route, as it has done in so many other infrastructure projects in southern Mexico? Much will depend on whether Mexico continues to serve as a point of entry for competitively priced manufactured goods into the US market, which cannot be taken for granted. Of course, Washington will try to talk Mexico out of accepting any offers of Chinese funds. Mexico, like Panama, finds itself caught in a tussle between two apex superpowers, and is already paying a heavy price. US pressure to impose equivalent tariffs on Chinese goods continues to rise. To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam. If the Trump administration does try to impose its will on Mexico’s re-emerging trade route as it has tried to do with the Panama Canal, so far unsuccessfully, it will heap even further pressure on the rapidly fracturing global trade system. And if this goes on for long enough, global trade volumes will ultimately begin to fall, perhaps even obviating the need for so many transoceanic trade routes in the first place. “It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project…it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention.” I recall seeing a report somewhere that five guys in a boat were seen leaving the Baltic Sea and heading south into the Atlantic Ocean, carrying several strange tall objects about the height of ICBM’s as cargo. But to what ends is Trump trying to control China? The majority of the ships through the Panama Canal go to the US. Many go from east to west coast of the US. Some from Europe to west coast, others Asia to east coast. And since the US is a major importer, any shutting of the canal/ports would hurt the US more than China. While he might not care, I’m not so sure the vast majority of Americans won’t. The rail would allow the largest MGX-24 (24,000 TEU) to dock. As they are way to big for the canal. From what can find a fully automated port can load/empty 24k in 12 hrs. I wonder how the costs of doing this is vs the cost of the canal transit and adding many days of waiting time? Well, it seems unlikely that the port will be as well run under BlackRock (who will be incentivized to run it down and then dump the mess on the US govt) than under its current CHinese management. See what BlackRock and its ilk have done to US health care and so many other industries – maximize profit, enshitify service, skip maintenance. Waiting to use the word ‘enshitify’ so late in that excellent point was a class move. Thanks for the lesson. It’s an interesting project and more so because it is an updated 19th century scheme. It will never replace the canal but that is not it’s intent. I can see it being used to ship cargo on a reliable timetable which is no longer true of the Panama canal due to problems with water supplies declining which the canal needs to operate. You know what might be interesting? If China came in and built a high-speed rail running parallel the the cargo railway to connect up all those communities in that corridor. Thanks for the great report. It may be time to consider whether the defeat of the last administration was a blow to hegemony–the “blob”–or has brought us hegemony on steroids as embodied in one very flawed personality and his increasingly sycophantic staff. So far hegemony 2 consists of the considerable hot air that comes out of Trump’s mouth but should he indeed start a war with Iran, or even Panama, it will be the American people who will also suffer as we join Netanyahu in the rogue nation category. The public tolerated and even applauded “we’re an empire now” under the Bush Jr. regime but then had considerable buyer’s remorse as Iraq and Afghanistan turned sour and endless. The Dems got it wrong about Trump who is nothing like Hitler but may be very much like the foolish Kaiser Wilhelm with his obsession with his costumes and inferiority complex. The adults running Trump’s many would be targets need to assert themselves and seem to be doing so. Moon suggests a walkback of Trump’s unhinged Sunday rant toward Putin https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/03/russigates-role-in-trump-putin-relations.html So is it another “360” by the Donald? Or is he merely willing to be reasonable with nuclear armed Russia but not all those “shitty little countries” as he called them like Yemen and Panama? Is it still kick down/suck up? The psychodrama is getting old fast. If you’re ever in Panama City, I urge you to visit the Canal Museum. Quietly–movingly–it underscores the incredible racism that underlay the canal’s construction, beginning to end, the 27,000-plus deaths that came with it. The entire world thinks that Panama runs the canal better than we did and the Panamanian people (including my students there during the summer of ’23) are proud of the fact. Incidents like the murder of 22 students who wanted to fly their country’s flag at Balboa High School in the Canal Zone in 1964–not to mention the flattening, with more than 200 completely unnecessary deaths, of the poor Panama City El Chorillo neighborhood during our invasion–are not forgotten. We forget how hard it is to invade and hold a country. We will find out once more if we choose to go into places like Iran or Panama. Very rough math: For a 20,000 TEU (assume max container ship) = 20,000 TEUs / 250 TEUs per train = 80 trains to move containers from coast to coast. For a 5,000 car Ro-Ro, 12 cars per autorack, 417 autorack rail cars, so about 4.5 trains. Loading/unloading autoracks/Ro-Ro is much faster than loading containers too, maybe about 24 hours turnaround. So it looks to me like it’s feasible for autos and probably bulk, but perhaps not for containers and intermodal? I guess i am behind the curve. “To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam.” But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place. Wasn’t Obambam excluding China from the TPP when he was in office? Then Hillary finally came out against the TPP at the end of her campaign? “But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place.” My guess is that Chinese steel enters Malaysia and Vietnam through the already deep trade ties Beijing has with these countries, and then some of that steel ends up heading towards Mexico under the preferential conditions of the TPP. The economist Robert E Scott warned about this happening wrt the US in an article for the Economic Policy Institute in late 2016, just months before Trump walked away from the deal. Here’s the intro: President Obama has built his closing case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a political argument, saying “…we can’t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules.” But it is both arrogant and wrong to think that the United States has the power to shape the rules governing China’s relationship to TPP signatories. As of today, China has already established deeper trade ties than the United States with the TPP nations. Further, congressional approval of the TPP would actually lock in those advantages for China. China has a large trade surplus with the TPP countries, and crucial terms of the agreement (specifically weak rules of origin (ROO) requirements, which we’ll talk about in detail below) would provide a back-door guarantee for China and other non-TPP members to duty-free access to U.S. and other TPP markets. Thanks Nick Vera Cruz is the starting point for past invasions of Mexico (Cortes, re the Conquest & General Scot re Mexico _US treaty of Gaudalupe Hidalgo). In 1900, work started on the Kansas City, Mexico , and Orient Railway (now El Chepe in Mexico across the Copper Canyon) which was to connect the US to the Pacific. The advantage of the Mexican connecection is that if the land transit times are short and if the offloading/loading logistics are efficient, then Pacific (Asia) -Mexico boats could carry loads a shorter direction in both directions. Like wise , boats leaving Vera Cruz could consolidate their Pacific cargo for points towards the Atlantic , etc. Also, in November Nicarauga President Ortega proposed to China to build a Atlantic/Pacific Canal through that country. The Panama Canal is not without its difficulties. Be careful what you wish for, if the US ‘reclaims’, it gets to service the operation, etc. Don’t understand the importance of Balboa and Cristobal (container I assume?) ports to cross-canal shipping? Have some interest as my father was stationed in Coco Solo during WWII as a flying boat engine mechanic. He also deployed with a detachment from his squadron to the Galapagos Islands which was used as a flying boat logistics center (in the last half of the war Japanese subs were considered the primary threat). So its not like a US base in Galapagos is something new (Army Air Force also had a bomber base there). From the Galapagos Conservancy: The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 enhanced the strategic importance of the Galapagos Islands as a potential refueling station for trans-oceanic transport. In 1911, the US suggested a 99-year lease of the islands in return for US$15 million. Later, the US and Ecuador discussed the rental or purchase of San Cristóbal, or of the whole archipelago. With the advent of the Second World War, the strategic significance of Galapagos grew, and, in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and with concern about Japanese actions in East Asia, the US approached Ecuador with the idea of establishing a US airbase on Baltra Island to protect the Panama Canal. At the end of 1941, US forces arrived from the Panama Canal Zone. In 1942, the US Sixth Air Force constructed the air base which was to have important long-term consequences for the islands. In 1943, this base was home to 2,474 US officers and men and 750 civilian laborers; as such, this was the largest colonization of the islands to that date. In 1941, the civilian population of the Galapagos Islands was 810 people. The arrival of so many people increased the demand for water, fish, and agricultural products, and threw a lifeline to the people eking out a livelihood on the islands. Base crews constructed a water pipeline from the highlands to Wreck Bay, in San Cristóbal, and used barges to transport water to Baltra Island. The availability of water in Wreck Bay made San Cristóbal more attractive to immigration and meant that people could move down to live in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. The greatest legacy was the construction of the first land-based airport in the islands—now modernized to serve as the main entry point for most travelers to the Galapagos Islands. The US closed the air base in 1946; residents dismantled the structures left behind, using the components to build many of the early houses in Puerto Ayora and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Also, in 2023, over a year before Trump 2.0 took power, the head of the US Southern Command, Laura Richardson, underscored the Chinese presence in critical infrastructure in Latin America as a threat to US national security and hence the importance of maritime dominance to counter it. She highlighted the presence of five Chinese companies along the Panama Canal and the strategic value of the new port in Chancay, Peru. Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink Says Bitcoin to Outperform USD: New Crypto to Ride the Next Rally

BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, says that the US dollar risks losing its dominance to Bitcoin, a sentiment shared by political heavyweights like Senator Cynthia Lummis. We take a look at how pro-crypto assertions like these could help rally the market and fuel new crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). ‘If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,’ Fink stated in his annual letter to investors. The letter touched upon several core problems that plague US society today, including the average American’s poor financial literacy and the need to democratize investments. Fink warned that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and gradual public adoption over the years could soon threaten the supremacy of the US dollar: The solution to the US’s current financial and economic problems, Fink believes, can be found in digital assets because ‘tokenization is democratization’ and Bitcoin leads the way. That these statements come from BlackRock lends even more weight, knowing that the company’s trademark iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds over 570K $BTC, worth over $48B. Furthermore, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund has received a series of $USDC inflows, with the latest valued at $7M, for a total of $33M over the past three days. If tokenization is the future, Blackrock is already there. Staunch crypto advocate, Senator Lummis echoes Fink’s views on X. After announcing the Bitcoin Act back in July 2024, meant to increase the US Federal Reserve’s Bitcoin pool to over $1M, she clapped back at Congress yesterday for not passing the Act fast enough. She then pressed the gas pedal one post later with a blunt: ‘Say it with me: Pass the BITCOIN Act.’ in response to Fink’s statements. The signs are clear: no matter how bearish the markets are right now, the crypto sphere is entering an era of unprecedented top-level support and widespread adoption, with $BTC leading the way. In this context, it’s good to keep an eye on some of the best new crypto that could be part of the next bull run. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project with ambitions to upgrade Solana’s ecosystem and deliver lower fees and faster on-chain transactions. The project promises to rectify core problems with Solana’s current performance, like failed transactions, long downtimes during network outages, and frequent network congestion. As the team achieves its milestones, the devs post regular updates on their work schedule. The latest update focused on their collaboration with Sovereign to achieve faster transaction processing and greater TPS (Transactions per Second). The presale is ongoing, having raised over $28M so far, with the price of $SOLX sitting at $0.00168. This strong early performance makes it one of the best presales in 2025, along with the 142% APY designed to attract stakers and early investors. Tokenomics data: Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the most promising meme coins, thanks to its links to Bitcoin proper. The project attracts investors with long-term $BTC airdrops, each coming at key $BTC price points ($150K, $200K, etc.), and if you hold the tokens in Best Wallet. $BTBULL was born from the idea that $BTC will eventually reach and surpass the $1M market evaluation. As such, the developer team aims to hype up investors to support Bitcoin’s bull run, in turn, dragging Bitcoin Bull Token along for the ride. The presale has raised $4.3M so far, with the $BTCBULL price sitting at a still super low $0.00244. Staking is at 97% currently, with a staking pool of over 1B. Tokenomics data: OpenSea ($SEA) is the first and biggest NFT marketplace in the game. If you want to buy, sell, and mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art, collectibles, music, virtual property, this is the place to be. The company launched its beta in February of this year and recommends itself as a ‘fully reimagined product’ for NFT collectors and pro investors. It promises to bring several key features, including native cross-chain purchasing, 0% swap fees, and an unmatched collection of different markets. $SEA is set to have its public launch in 2025, but it doesn’t have an official date yet. Until that happens, you can interact with the OpenSea world right now if you’re a fan of tokenized art. All three covered above are viable new token projects to keep an eye on as the crypto verse expands. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin will rally, but when. After all, we live in a universe where financial mammoths like Blackrock and US political figures like Cynthia Lummis are pushing hard for adoption while highlighting Bitcoin’s superiority over USD. Who would’ve believed it back in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published his little 9-page paper, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’? As always, there’s no holding back progress. That said, this is not financial advice. DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before investing and have a solid risk management strategy in place to minimize losses.

Title: Forbes’ 39th Annual World’s Billionaires List: More Than 3,000 Worth $16 Trillion
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2025/04/01/forbes-39th-annual-worlds-billionaires-list-more-than-3000-worth-16-trillion/

ByChase Peterson-Withorn ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. The world’s billionaires have always been rich and powerful—but never more than now. That’s particularly true in the United States, where Donald Trump was sworn in (again) as America’s billionaire-in-chief in January. This time around, he’s giving the billionaire class more control over the government than ever before. His right-hand man is the planet’s richest person. His administration includes at least ten billionaires and billionaire spouses. And scores of billionaire execs—from Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault—have lined up behind Trump. The billionaire bonanza extends beyond the U.S., however. A record 3,028 people around the globe make Forbes’ annual World’s Billionaires list this year, 247 more than last year. It’s the first time the billionaire population has crossed the 3,000 mark. They’re worth a record $16.1 trillion in all, $2 trillion more than a year ago and more than the GDP of every country in the world besides the U.S. and China. The average fortune now stands at $5.3 billion, up $200 million from 2024. There are now three people worth more than $200 billion for the first time ever, part of the record 15 members of the $100 Billion Club, the elite group at the very top of the list whose net worths span a dozen digits. That’s up from 14 a year ago and none in 2017. These 15 centibillionaires are worth $2.4 trillion—more than the bottom 1,500 billionaires combined. The richest of all is Elon Musk, worth an estimated $342 billion. Despite spending a lot more of his (already divided) time heading DOGE, Trump’s cost-cutting operation, Musk has added $147 billion to his fortune over the past year, thanks to a blockbuster year for his rocket company SpaceX and his AI firm xAI (which he merged with his social media giant X last week). Even Tesla, despite recent protests and a stock market selloff, is trading higher than a year ago. That’s allowed Musk to reclaim the title of world’s richest person from Arnault, and has given him a $126 billion lead over the next richest person: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $216 billion), who ranks No. 2 for the first time. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($215 billion) ranks No. 3 and Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($192 billion) ranks fourth. Arnault ($178 billion), meanwhile, slides down to fifth, his lowest rank since 2017, amid a slump in shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH. Forbes used stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025 for this year’s ranking. The United States, with a record 902 billionaire citizens, continues to boast more billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. China, with 516 (including Hong Kong), remains second and India, with 205, still ranks third. More than 50% of all listees are citizens of one of these three countries, but altogether 76 nations and two semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire, including Albania for the first time ever. Forbes also added 15 from Saudi Arabia this year, after removing the Kingdom’s billionaires in 2018 following a government crackdown. In all, 288 fresh faces join the annual Billionaires ranking this year. That includes celebrities such as rockstar Bruce Springsteen ($1.2 billion), movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1.1 billion) and comedian Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion). Also new: controversial crypto kingpin Justin Sun ($8.5 billion), several artificial intelligence tycoons from such companies as Anthropic, CoreWeave and DeepSeek, and the moguls behind several notable food chains: Cava, Chipotle, Jersey Mike’s and Zaxby’s. The wealthiest newcomer of all is Marilyn Simons ($31 billion), the widow of hedge fund legend Jim Simons, who died in May 2024. He was one of 32 billionaires who died over the past year. (Another, Israeli industrial titan Stef Wertheimer, died in late March, after we locked in the list, and thus appears in the ranks.) Simons is one of just 406 women among the World’s Billionaires, only 13.4% of the list, up a hair from 13.3% last year. Nearly three-quarters inherited their fortunes. That includes the world’s richest woman, Walmart heir Alice Walton ($101 billion), who has overtaken French L’Oreal heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion) for the top spot among women. Forbes found just 113 self-made women around the globe, the richest of whom is Swiss shipping tycoon Rafaela Aponte-Diamant ($37.7 billion) whose company teamed with BlackRock this year on a plan to buy 43 ports, including two in Panama. Overall, 67% of the list is self-made—meaning they founded or cofounded their company or established their own fortune, rather than inheriting it—up from 66% in 2024. The youngest self-made billionaire is Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), who is 28. Wang is one of just 21 billionaires who are 30 or younger, including Johannes von Baumbach ($5.4 billion), a 19-year-old heir to a German pharmaceuticals fortune, a newcomer who is now the world’s youngest billionaire. The oldest billionaire, at age 103, is U.S. insurance tycoon George Joseph ($1.9 billion), one of four listees who have hit the century mark. The average billionaire is 66 years old. Few billionaires have had a better year than Donald Trump—and not just because he retook the U.S. presidency. Before moving back into the White House, he padded his cash pile with a very lucrative move into crypto. Between that and his Trump Media & Technology Group going public just after Forbes locked in its 2024 rankings, the president’s net worth has more than doubled, from an estimated $2.3 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion. A small handful of billionaires, relatively speaking, didn’t fare so well. A total of 107 people who were on the 2024 ranking are simply no longer rich enough to make the cut. Notable drop-offs include Lisa Su, who is the CEO of semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sara Liu, cofounder of embattled server and storage maker Supermicro; and Nicholas Puech, an heir to the Hermès luxury goods empire who says his fortune has vanished. The World’s Billionaires list is a ranking of every person on the planet who Forbes estimated to have a net worth of $1 billion U.S. dollars or more as of March 7, 2025. Some billionaires have gotten richer or poorer in the time since; indeed, Forbes found three more billionaires shortly after locking in this year’s list and there are likely more out there. Like most of our readers, we’re also bracing for the impact of tariffs on the global stock market. For daily updated rankings, see Forbes’ Real-Time tracker. When possible, we met with billionaires in person or spoke with them virtually or by phone. We also interviewed their employees, handlers, asset managers and financial advisors, rivals, peers and attorneys. Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory documents, court filings, probate records and news articles. We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more. We factored in known debt and charitable giving. We exclude dispersed family fortunes, though we list wealth belonging to the immediate family of the living founder of a fortune under the founder’s name. In some cases, we also include wealth held by the immediate family member of an heir. In either of those instances, you’ll see “& family” in a person’s listing. For the full list of the world’s 3,028 billionaires, see here.

Title: US Dollar To Lose Reserve Status If Investors View Bitcoin As A Safer Bet — BlackRock CEO

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has warned that the U.S. Dollar could lose its reserve status to Bitcoin. This comes on the heels of plunging global financial markets and rising domestic debt. The dollar has faced external pressure in recent months, with many suggesting Bitcoin’s adoption could pose a slight threat to the currency. In a new letter to investors, Larry Fink expressed concerns over the U.S. dollar’s dominance. He further highlighted the successes of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential of decentralized finance globally. According to him, the currency has enjoyed dominance for decades but is not a future guarantee. Bitcoin adoption, on the other hand, has grown exponentially in the last decade and could become a global currency if investors see it as a safer bet. Previously, traditional players viewed Bitcoin as high risk, warning clients against gaining exposure to the market. At the moment, institutional investors have increased their crypto exposure amid wider acceptance across several levels. Institutional appetite fueled Bitcoin to a $2 trillion market cap before headwinds hit major assets. The US dollar has been affected by rising debt and increased government spending. While inflation turns investors to other assets, Bitcoin is tipped as a hedge against inflationary trends. “The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paved the way for institutional investors and added legitimacy. These funds triggered wider adoption, taking the asset’s price to new all-time highs. After several products attracted nearly $40 billion in total assets, investors have delved into other crypto ETFs. BlackRock stood out as a major player in the space, with its Bitcoin product igniting other market participants. The firm’s total ETF arm recorded about $22 billion in net inflows last year. Bitcoin remained crucial as the crypto ETFs dominated narratives in 2024.

China's top market regulator said on Friday it will carry out an antitrust review of CK Hutchison's possible Panama Canal ports' deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to the website of the SAMR. Guo said that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rolloutâurging immediate action to decentralize assets. June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rolloutâurging immediate action to decentralize assets. In a chilling warning on Decentralized TV, investment strategist Chris Sullivan outlined two catastrophic economic collapse scenariosâhyperinflation from unchecked money printing or a deflationary spiral triggering mass debt defaults. His most alarming revelation? The looming threat of the "Great Taking"âa global elite scheme to confiscate wealth through centralized financial controls. Sullivan, a seasoned financial expert with decades of experience, urged viewers to "exit fiatânow" and embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, including Bitcoin, privacy coins, and precious metals. His insights reveal that institutional investors are already hedging against systemic failure by quietly moving into crypto, while stablecoins like Tether could become lifelines if traditional banking collapses. The Two Economic Doomsday Scenarios Sullivan warned that the U.S. dollar system faces two potential death spirals: Hyperinflation â The Federal Reserveâs endless money printing could render the dollar worthless, mirroring Weimar Germany or modern-day Venezuela. Deflationary Collapse â A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isnât going to even know theyâre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional bankingâwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" â A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assetsâhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, youâve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoptionâeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivanâs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivanâs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out.

Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivanâs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out.

Beijing’s displeasure over conglomerate’s plans highlights tightening business environment in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison, one of the largest conglomerates in Hong Kong, earlier this month announced plans to sell its stake in two ports on the Panama Canal to a group of US investors led by BlackRock. The plan, part of a $22.8bn megadeal that would grant the consortium control over more than 40 ports in 23 countries, followed complaints by United States President Donald Trump that the key shipping route was under Chinese control. CK Hutchison shares soared following news of the deal on March 4, but plunged less than two weeks later when Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-run newspaper in Hong Kong, accused the company in two op-eds of “spineless grovelling” and cutting a deal “that betrayed and sold out all Chinese people”. With an April 2 deadline to sign the deal looming, CK Hutchison is now in the crosshairs of both Washington and Beijing. Why would China want to stop the deal? Editorials in Ta Kung Pao, which is controlled by Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong through a subsidiary, are often read as signals from the upper ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kong leader John Lee, who was elected as the sole candidate in an election tightly controlled by Beijing, has criticised the CK Hutchison deal, saying it deserves “serious attention”. The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. On Friday, China’s market regulator said on its official WeChat account that it would carry out an antitrust investigation “in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. Following the news, local media, including the Sing Tao Daily and the South China Morning Post, reported that CK Hutchison would not go forward with the deal this week. What is Beijing’s relationship with CK Hutchison? The proposed sale has also highlighted longstanding tensions between Beijing and CK Hutchison and its 96-year-old billionaire founder, Li Ka-shing. Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. In 2015, Li raised eyebrows when he restructured his business interests and registered them in the Cayman Islands. Around this time, he also began to divest from China. In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. While analysts have offered differing opinions on whether the Li family tacitly supported calls for democracy in Hong Kong, there is broad agreement that it is less visibly pro-Beijing than many of the city’s other business dynasties. “Compared to other family offices of his generation – such as the Fok and Pao family, who invested in the mainland as early as the 1980s, or the Tung family, who are active in Sino-American relations and Hong Kong governance – Li and his sons position themselves as businesspeople who invest globally and distance themselves from politics,” Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute, told Al Jazeera. Can Beijing stop the sale from going ahead? Chan said Beijing is relatively constrained in terms of formal regulatory authority to stop the deal. “In strict legal terms, it will be quite difficult for Beijing and Hong Kong to call off the deal, given the companies and the ports involved are not ‘legally’ located within the jurisdiction of China and Hong Kong,” he said. Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong barrister and member of the city’s Executive Council, said the antitrust investigation could be seen as a “deterrent” against CK Hutchison moving forward with the deal. Tong said Chinese regulators typically do not step in to block Hong Kong business deals, but are within their rights to investigate. “If people carry on their business activities contrary to the law, they ought to be investigated to see whether they have fallen afoul of the law,” Tong told Al Jazeera. Experts quoted in the South China Morning Post said that Chinese regulators could claim legal jurisdiction over the deal by arguing that BlackRock’s acquisition of so many ports would give them a monopoly over regional trade routes. Proving that the deal would have an adverse impact on competition, however, could be more difficult, while invoking national security concerns could be challenging as BlackRock is a private company, the experts quoted by the Post said. Martina Fuchs, a business correspondent for the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, said she expects the deal to be delayed or called off as it has become “highly politicised.” “China’s criticism of CK Hutchison’s move to sell the ports business also reflects its strategic interests in the region on the one hand side, and the growing pressure from US President Donald Trump to curb China’s influence as well as worries about national security on the other,” Fuchs told Al Jazeera. “CK Hutchison being thrust into the crosshairs in the midst of the once-again escalating China-US trade war reflects how both powers are battling for control of the strategic waterway,” she said. What other pressure can Beijing apply? Even without going through formal legal channels, Beijing could apply pressure in other ways. CK Hutchison’s affiliate companies and business interests in the mainland are a point of vulnerability, according to an analyst who covers China’s economy, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of the issue. While CK Hutchison has wound down its investment in China, it still earns about 12 percent of its revenue from China – representing more than $300m in 2024. Its sister company, CK Asset Holdings, still owns dozens of properties in mainland China, which means it is also very exposed to Beijing, the analyst said. Foreign and local companies in Hong Kong will be closely watching to see what happens next, he said. “The wider Li family group of companies still has a meaningful amount of assets on the mainland, such as CK Asset’s property holdings. They are almost certainly aware that they could be exposed to retaliation from Beijing,” the analyst said. Kevin Yam, a lawyer who specialised in financial services and commercial litigation until he left Hong Kong in 2022, said Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma. After criticising China’s regulators in 2020, Ma was forced to cancel the IPO of Ant Financial, a financial subsidiary of Alibaba. Since then, he has only rarely been seen in public. “Hong Kong being Hong Kong, chances are they won’t cut the Li family down to size to the same extent as they did to Jack Ma, but I reckon ultimately whichever way this thing is going to go … it won’t be directly about the deal,” Yam, who is wanted by Hong Kong police over his participation in the 2019 protests, told Al Jazeera. Beijing has not shied away from using extrajudicial methods against prominent citizens in the past. In 2017, Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua – then one of China’s wealthiest people – vanished from the luxury hotel where he was living in Hong Kong, with multiple media outlets reporting that he had been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. Xiao’s exact whereabouts remained unknown for five years until 2022, when a Shanghai court sentenced the tycoon to 13 years imprisonment for allegedly embezzling $8bn. In 2023, Bao Fan, an influential Chinese tech banker, went incommunicado amid a crackdown on the financial services industry. Bao, whose firm announced his resignation last year, has not been publicly heard from since. What’s next for the CK Hutchison deal? With just a day to go until the April 2 deadline, the fate of the sale is unclear. While Chinese regulators are looking into the deal, the Hong Kong government has yet to investigate, according to Tong, who sits on the cabinet of Hong Kong’s chief executive. On the Chinese mainland, the government appears to be making use of both the carrot and the stick. Last week, Li’s son Richard was invited to the China Development Forum, a high-profile business summit held annually in Beijing. While Richard is not involved in the management of CK Hutchison, the markets interpreted his invitation as a positive sign for the company’s relations with Beijing, sending its shares 3.4 percent higher last Monday. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg reported that Beijing had issued a directive to state-owned enterprises to hold off on new business with CK Hutchison and its affiliates, citing people familiar with the matter. While it is still uncertain whether CK Hutchison and BlackRock will go ahead with the deal, a delay would not necessarily stop it in its tracks. The deal reportedly includes a 145-day exclusivity clause for negotiations, after which time CK Hutchison would be free to sell its assets to another party, according to the Post. The Post said neither party had revealed “the start or end” of the exclusivity period. Tong said it was difficult to say more without official word from CK Hutchison or BlackRock. “Very few facts are known to the public,” he said. “[CK Hutchison] is keeping mum, saying nothing at all, so people can only venture to guess what is happening.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: BlackRock, at centre of Panama ports deal, has nearly US$16 billion in Chinese stocks

SHANGHAI — BlackRock, the asset manager at the centre of a deal to buy US$23 billion in port assets from Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings, has about $15.5 billion invested in Hong Kong and mainland-listed stocks through its China-focused funds, with its portfolios concentrated on technology and financial companies. According to its website, the world's largest money manager has at least seven funds dedicated to Chinese stocks; five are passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and two are actively managed. The funds' top holdings as of the end of February included Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and China Merchants Bank, according to fact sheets. Alibaba owns the Post. The largest is the $7.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, which tracks the FTSE China 50 Index. The iShares MSCI China ETF, which tracks the MSCI China Index, ranked second with $6.3 billion in assets. The BlackRock China Fund is the larger of the two actively invested funds, with $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The BlackRock China A Opportunities Fund, which targets yuan-denominated stocks in mainland China, had $15.7 million in AUM. BlackRock also manages other funds with regional or global scopes that may also be invested in Chinese equities. Earlier in March, CK Hutchison said it would sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock for US$23 billion. The deal triggered a backlash and on Friday, Beijing said it would launch an antitrust probe into the sale. US President Donald Trump, who had lobbied for the canal to be freed from what he called Chinese control, hailed the deal, amid trade-based tensions between Beijing and Washington. The New York-based asset manager did not reply to an email from the Post seeking comment. A BlackRock building is seen in New York, the United States. (File photo: Reuters) At the end of 2023, BlackRock had AUM of US$10 trillion with US$5.3 trillion invested in stocks worldwide, according to its latest annual report. The firm's iShares China Large-Cap ETF is up 18% this year and its iShares MSCI China ETF has risen 16%. Both have benefited from a stock market rally triggered by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's release of two powerful but cost-effective large language models. The BlackRock China Fund, managed by Lucy Liu and Ada Zhang, has gained 14% so far this year. Tencent was the fund's top holding, accounting for 9.2% of its assets, followed by Alibaba at 8.5% and Xiaomi at 6.5%. The firm's China A Opportunities Fund has underperformed with a 3.2% rise this year, though it bested a 1.2% loss for the CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks over the same period. Its top three holdings were EV battery maker CATL, China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance. As of March 17, BlackRock funds held a combined 984.8 million shares of Alibaba, representing a 5.2% stake, according to data from Hong Kong's stock exchange. It also held 47.4 million Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE, a maker of telecoms equipment, representing a stake of 6.2%. BlackRock also recently held a 5.09% stake in CK Hutchison. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has said after his meetings with global financial leaders, investors were saying they would increase their exposure to Chinese stocks. And global investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised their targets for major China stock indices this year, citing appealing valuations and the positive impact on earnings from DeepSeek's breakthrough. For its part, BlackRock has said it was cautious about the outlook for Chinese stocks. "We are modestly overweight," the BlackRock Investment Institute said in its latest weekly commentary on March 24. "We think AI and tech excitement could keep driving returns, potentially reducing the odds of much-anticipated government stimulus. We stand ready to pivot. We remain cautious given structural challenges to China's growth and tariff risks."

Title: Xi showdown with Li Ka-shing threatens China’s pro-business push

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a "predictable” business environment, China’s market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing’s deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to "protect public interests.” Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing Li's CK Hutchison Holdings of acting "in concert with U.S. hegemony” over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the U.S. president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock as America "reclaiming” the famed waterway.

Title: Less than half of Irish workers feel ready for ‘comfortable retirement’, survey shows

Many families are still feeling the affects of the cost-of-living crisis.. Stock image A new survey has found that less than half of Irish workers believe that they can live a comfortable life after retirement. Financial advisers BlackRock surveyed 400 workers in Ireland, 300 of whom participate in Defined Contribution (DC) schemes – workplace plans where both employer and employee contribute a certain amount. “The 2025 survey highlights the importance of pensions in securing a comfortable retirement,” said Tim Hodgson, head of DC platforms and retirement solutions at BlackRock. “Retirement readiness remains a significant concern for many workers, with less than half (41pc) of survey participants feeling on-track for a reasonable standard of living in retirement. “This concern is particularly acute among those without DC workplace pensions, with only 26pc feeling prepared.” Next September, Irish workers who are not already enrolled in a pension plan will be automatically added to the My Future Fund or the auto-enrolment plan. Under the scheme, employees aged between 23 and 60 earning above €20,000 will be automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, unless they decide to opt out of it after six months. While participants showed interest in the scheme, the survey noted that there was a lack of understanding about the new pension plan and concerns about its affordability. In December, a report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) found that just one in 10 employees eligible for the auto-enrolment plan were aware of it. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment, it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” Mr Hodgson said. Out of the people surveyed who were not part of an existing pension plan, more than two-thirds said they would opt in to the scheme in year one but had concerns about affording it. The survey also noted generational differences in people’s attitude towards retirement. “Pre-retirees [people aged 60 to 69] and Gen X [those aged 45 to 60] ranked saving for retirement among their top-three financial priorities, whereas millennials [29-44] ranked it last in their financial priorities,” it said. “The introduction of auto enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement,” Mr Hodgson said.
