Title: Goldman Sach says it's just following the law as it strips out references to DEI

Goldman Sachs tamped down the diversity language in its annual report as DEI efforts come under fire from the Trump administration. The bank also said "aspirational hiring goals" it set five years ago expire this year without saying whether it planned to set new goals. Goldman's 2024 annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, referenced diversity relating to human capital just three times, versus 14 in the 2023 report and 16 times in the 2022 report. The Wall Street bank also eliminated a section of the report previously titled "Diversity and Inclusion," its hiring breakdown by race and gender and its diverse hiring goals by race and gender. Earlier this year, Goldman dropped a policy requiring companies it advises on IPOs to have at least two women directors. Goldman isn't alone. The $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock this week also cut mentions of its "three pillar DEI strategy" in its annual report, as well as a breakout of its employee demographics by race and gender. It also amended the metrics used to determine borrowing costs for a $4.4 billion credit facility which was previously tied to its efficacy in boosting internal DEI targets. The changes come as President Trump cracks down on DEI. In January, he invoked directed the Department of Justice to investigate DEI policies, prohibiting private organizations from instituting such initiatives in employment practices related to federal contracts. In a statement, Goldman CEO David Solomon cited changes to the law. "We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US," he said. "Our people are a powerful example of that and that's why we will continue to focus on the importance of attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent." Goldman said in the report that it still believes in a diverse workforce and would "continue to develop programs consistent with our fundamental commitment to inclusive merit-based promotion and compliance with the law." The bank's 2023 report set goals to hire of 50% women analysts and associates, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the UK. In 2023, it also broke down its workforce by race and gender, saying its analyst and associate hires included 49% women professionals, 9% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 15% Black professionals in the UK. Also gone are mentions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs. In the 2023 report, Goldman said it would seek to double the number of campus hires in the US recruited from HBCUs in 2025 relative to 2020.What's more, a breakdown of the firm's aspirational goals for diverse hiring is also missing. For Goldman, DEI has historically been framed as a business imperative. In its 2022 annual report, the firm stated that "diversity at all levels" was "essential to our sustainability" and cited efforts to increase representation among women and underrepresented groups. At the time, the firm touted stats, such as one where it said approximately 57% of Goldman's board was diverse by race, gender, or sexual orientation. Even so, its track record on DEI has come under fire for other reasons. Last year, reporting from The Wall Street Journal found that numerous senior women at the bank felt it hadn't done enough to support their career prospects or advancement, and was still heavily male-dominated.

Title: People are pumping the brakes on their expectations of economic growth

Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners. In today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things. What's on deck Markets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office. Tech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat. Business: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post. But first, we're taking it slow. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short. President Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year. Neil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish. The market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently. That's a key benchmark of DOGE's success — lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers — but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven. Dutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming — consumer and government spending — showing signs of strain. To Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year. He's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors — tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending — for why he was "actually pretty negative for the first time in a while" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed. The Point72 founder said he expects a "significant correction." Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral. Predictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration. Before the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change. But in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as "potential growth headwinds." All this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial "heart attack" if not addressed. But Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system. ​​"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy," he said. 1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble — down as much as 13% from its January high — and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern. 2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games — these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more. 3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul. 1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations — and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call. 2. Is having Palantir on your résumé the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring. 3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect — and how much it'll cost. 1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint "is nothing more than disgruntled former members." 2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support "free markets" and "personal liberties," he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil. 3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe turns into a compelling alternative amid a bleak Bitcoin sentiment

Bitcoin’s recent tumble has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level in over two years, signaling extreme fear among investors. Macroeconomic uncertainties, fueled by threats of trade tariffs from US President Donald Trump, have only added to the unease. However, amid this bleak backdrop, a new project dubbed Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a potential alternative for crypto enthusiasts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently hit a score of 10, its lowest since June 2022. That period saw major crypto collapses like Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, sparking widespread panic. Today, the sentiment echoes that fear, even without similar crashes. Bitcoin’s price has dropped nearly 16% in the past 30 days, hovering around $86,304. Analysts pin this on macroeconomic pressures, including Trump’s reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with threats aimed at the European Union stoking fears of a trade war. Bitcoin investment products, particularly US spot Bitcoin ETFs, are bleeding cash. Over seven days, $3 billion flowed out, including a record $420 million single-day exit from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Funds like Ark 21Shares and Grayscale saw heavy withdrawals too. However, some analysts remain hopeful. Ben Simpson of Collective Shift says buying during extreme fear often pays off historically. But Arthur Hayes warns of a drop to $70,000. Ki Young Ju notes 30% corrections are normal in bull cycles, citing a 53% dip in 2021 that Bitcoin overcame. Amid the volatile crypto market, Bitcoin Pepe is stepping up as a fresh option in the stormy market with its ongoing presale. With the “World’s Only Bitcoin Meme ICO,” the project aims to bring Solana-like perks of speed and low fees to Bitcoin’s sturdy network. It’s a Layer-2 solution built for meme coins. The PEP-20 standard is its backbone. It lets anyone launch meme coins on Bitcoin, tapping into the blockchain’s unmatched resilience. Bitcoin’s staying power makes this a big deal. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale is rolling along in Stage 5 of 30, having raised $3,632,454 at press time, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0255 and set to rise to $0.0268 in the next stage. This tiered pricing shows a deliberate rollout plan aimed to incentivize early investors. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme coin wave, blending it with Bitcoin’s strength with instant transactions and tiny fees to draw users tired of Bitcoin’s usual costs, its presale offers a compelling haven for those who want to hedge against the current market turmoil. Looking ahead, the project’s roadmap hints at future growth with talk of partnerships and integrations.

Title: BlackRock moves $441 million in Bitcoin to Coinbase in the past hour

Share this article BlackRock moved 5,100 Bitcoin worth approximately $441 million and 30,000 Ether valued at about $71 million to Coinbase Prime within the last hour, as tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The transfer follows BlackRock’s Tuesday movement of $160 million in Bitcoin and $44 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, amid mounting pressure on BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT has experienced negative performance for three consecutive days, with approximately $741 million in net outflows so far this week, based on Farside Investors data. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day outflows of over $1 billion on Tuesday, with IBIT accounting for $164 million of the withdrawals. Given the recent Bitcoin ETF sell-off, with IBIT posting negative performance for three consecutive days, the deposit raises concerns about further liquidations. The latest transfers come as Bitcoin recovered slightly above $86,000 after dropping to $83,000 on Tuesday, its lowest level since November 2024. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes previously warned that hedge funds employing an arbitrage strategy—long IBIT and short CME futures for enhanced yield—pose a potential risk to Bitcoin’s price. He cautioned that if the basis spread narrows during a Bitcoin decline, these funds might sell IBIT and buy back futures, potentially driving the price towards $70,000.

Title: Fidelity Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios (Meant for Advisors)

Time Published: 2025-02-27T08:12:21Z

My Money Blog One of my older relatives used Fidelity to manage their investments, and it was a hodgepodge of over 10 different mutual funds with a total expense ratio nearing 1%. The last time I measured its long-term performance, it lagged the benchmark indexes by… roughly 1%. Since then, I’ve always viewed that as a big part of Fidelity’s business model. They will sell you a portfolio that looks complex and smart, with fancy-sounding names and lots of moving parts. In the end, your performance will be okay because it will capture most of the stock market return, and most folks won’t even notice the chunk that was missing from fees. From a certain perspective, you paid a fee and got what you wanted: a stamp of approval from a respectable name. If you’re wondering how Fidelity can offer their excellent customer service and products at such a competitive prices, this is why. There are many people paying additional fees for their various advisory services. I’m okay with that – as a DIY investor I am comfortable turning down their upsell pitches for additional assistance. So when I saw the ETF.com article Fidelity Debuts All-ETF Model Portfolios for Advisors, I admit that I had my preconceived notions. Would they surprise me? You can view all of model portfolios here. Here is a screenshot with just their moderate risk 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. The hodgepodge of fancy names is still going strong. It’s like a checklist of industry buzz words: Dynamic Growth, Enhanced, High Dividend, Momentum, Inflation, Multifactor. I find it amusing that Dividend tends to equate to “Value”, which is the opposite of “Growth”. If you own this many different things, how different is it really from just owning the entire stock market? There still appears to be added complexity just for the sake of looking complex. Is it really helpful to have 2% in the iShares Core Dividend ETF? Or 2% in Cash Sweep? SIX to EIGHT different US bond ETFs??? With a weighted expense ratio of 0.25%, the overall cost is much lower than their active mutual fund portfolios from 10+ years ago. Competition from Vanguard and Blackrock have forced the expense ratios lower across the industry. So while the Fidelity model seems to pretty much the same, it does now come potentially at a lower price. So that’s a good thing. Some of these Fidelity ETFs are barely a year old, so we can’t do a backtest. I will have to remember to run another comparison 10 years from now between this 60/40 Fidelity ETF portfolio and a simple 3-ETF low-cost index portfolio from Vanguard (42% VTI/18% VXUS/40% BND) or iShares (42% ITOT/18% IXUS/40% IUSB). The low-cost index portfolio have a weighted expense ratio of about 0.04%. Can the Fidelity outperform and justify their higher fees? Complexity breeds dependency. If the advisor placed the funds in 3 or 4 ETFs, or a single Target Retirement Fund, the customer would soon question why they are paying for advisory services. We can’t have that! 🎯 😁 I imagine there’s also at least some overlap between some of these ETFs. Is there a tool that can take a number of ETFs/mutual funds and go through their holdings to determine how much you’re holding of each company? That could also be used to immediately determine how this fares against the Vanguard and iShares since the underlying holdings have been around for long enough.

Title: Bitcoin Post-Election Rally Crushed: Prices Dip Below $84,000 As Tariff Tensions Rise

On Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) prices plummeted to a four-month low, reaching as low as $81,000, as the anticipated “Trump bump” in the markets faded. This has prompted investors and traders to hedge against further decreases, with Bitcoin options indicating a notable interest in put options with a strike price of $70,000. According to data from Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, this strike price represents the second-highest open interest among all contracts set to expire on February 28, with a total of $4.9 billion in open interest poised to expire by Friday. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Bitcoin has experienced a substantial decline of roughly 20% from its record highs. Market analysts attribute this downturn to a combination of factors, including Trump’s “aggressive geopolitical” stance and ongoing concerns about elevated inflation. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted, “Tariff policies are further dampening the outlook, and stubbornly high short-term inflation expectations add to the overall caution.” Newhouse also highlighted that the Bybit Ethereum (ETH) hack has not only exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price but has also negatively impacted overall market sentiment. The market has also witnessed a significant liquidation of bullish bets, with around $2 billion wiped out over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin perpetual futures—a popular method for offshore investors to leverage their positions—saw a sharp decline in long positions during this timeframe. Adding to the bearish sentiment, demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has waned, with the group experiencing approximately $2.1 billion in outflows over the past six days. This reflects a broader trend of investors pulling back, with more than $1 billion withdrawn from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday alone, marking the largest outflow since these funds debuted in January of the previous year. The Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were among the hardest hit. Bohan Jiang, head of over-the-counter options trading at Abra, commented, “This is a mix of spot selling and basis unwind. In my view, nearly all of this is from ETF spot outflows from directional traders.” Ethereum has also felt the impact of the Bybit incident, amplifying its volatility, while Solana (SOL) has surrendered gains achieved in recent months amid declining interest in memecoins. The market’s search for a new catalyst to reverse its bearish sentiment has led many investors to remain on the sidelines, rotating out of cryptocurrencies in a risk-off environment. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at crypto prime broker FalconX, stated, “The crypto market is still in search of a new catalyst to reverse bearish sentiment.” Currently, BTC is attempting to find support at $84,578, but has fallen another 4.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Title: Irelandâs electricity crisis: AI data centers to consume one third of national grid by 2026

While the Irish government, through the Irish Development Authority (IDA), champions these developments as critical to the nationâs digital economy, critics argue that the benefits disproportionately serve transnational corporations rather than Irish citizens. This raises urgent questions about energy equity, national infrastructure, and the long-term sustainability of Irelandâs energy policies. The rise of data centers and the AI boom The rapid expansion of data centers in Ireland is inextricably linked to the global rise of AI technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Irish data centers will consume a staggering 33% of the countryâs electricity grid by 2026. Currently, Ireland hosts between 82 and 95 data centers, with dozens more under construction or in the planning stages. By 2026, this number is expected to reach 130, cementing Irelandâs status as a European hub for data storage and processing. While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that âAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,â noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. âWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,â wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish governmentâs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nationâs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Irelandâs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers?

As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers?

While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish governmentâs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nationâs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply.

Title: Breitbart Business Digest: DEI Was Built on Fear; Now It’s Collapsing Under Reality

Bye, Bye American DEI The reckonings have been swift and dizzying. A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment. What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed. Citigroup has eliminated race-based hiring quotas. Bank of America has followed suit. Goldman Sachs has abandoned its diversity mandate for IPOs. BlackRock, once a champion of DEI, has quietly stripped references to its diversity programs from corporate filings. Deloitte U.S. has told employees working on government contracts to remove gender pronouns from email signatures. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are rolling back DEI commitments as federal contractors. Even Amazon and Google, longtime standard-bearers of corporate progressivism, have purged DEI language from their reports and workforce policies. PBS has shuttered its DEI office entirely. What happened? Reality asserted itself. DEI programs, long protected by corporate inertia and the threat of activist pressure, have now run up against two immovable forces: the law and the bottom line. The Supreme Court’s ruling against affirmative action in college admissions made it clear that race-based decision-making in hiring was legally questionable at best. President Donald Trump’s executive order banning race and gender discrimination in federal contracting turned that into a direct threat to corporate balance sheets. Suddenly, compliance departments and general counsels had to take a hard look at policies that had long been implemented with little concern for legal exposure. Meanwhile, DEI’s economic toll was becoming harder to ignore. Despite years of corporate executives insisting that diversity initiatives boosted the bottom line, those claims never quite added up. Shareholders were left wondering why companies were prioritizing ideological agendas over maximizing returns. Employees grew resentful as hiring and promotions were increasingly dictated by identity rather than merit. Consumers, once silent, became vocal opponents of activist-driven corporate policies. The backlash was inevitable. This isn’t just a political correction. It’s a preference cascade—a moment when people and institutions rapidly abandon an ideology they once publicly supported but never truly believed in. History is full of such moments, where dominant narratives, long maintained through social pressure and enforced consensus, suddenly disintegrate. The medieval kings of Europe, for centuries, paid lip service to pagan gods while privately considering the growing influence of Christianity. Then, as soon as a key ruler—such as Clovis I of the Franks—converted, others quickly followed, exposing how fragile the old order had really been. Corporate America’s embrace of DEI functioned the same way: upheld not by deep conviction but by the fear of reputational ruin. Once a few key institutions abandoned it, the illusion of universal commitment crumbled overnight. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe followed a similar trajectory. The regimes of Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia seemed invincible—right up until the moment they weren’t. When Poland broke free in 1989, the chain reaction toppled East Germany, then the Soviet Union itself. The institutions of corporate DEI operated on the same model—an ideology enforced through intimidation and groupthink, rather than genuine consensus. The moment legal and economic incentives changed, corporations fled from it just as quickly as Eastern European states abandoned Marxism. Perhaps the most striking parallel, however, is with the rapid collapse of the eugenics movement. In the early 20th century, eugenics was considered the height of scientific progress, endorsed by leading intellectuals, politicians, and business leaders. Then came the horrors of World War II, and suddenly eugenics became a discredited ideology. Its former champions rewrote history, distancing themselves from the cause they had once fervently supported. The same pattern is emerging now with DEI. Companies that once prided themselves on their diversity pledges are quietly deleting the language from their websites, erasing references in annual reports, and pretending they were never all that invested in the first place. LGBTQ flag and Black Lives Matter banner on gym doors, Manhattan, New York. (Joan Slatkin/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The media, predictably, is still catching up. The same outlets that once insisted the corporate DEI revolution was irreversible now publish cautious stories about companies “re-evaluating” their commitments. But the scale of this shift goes far beyond a temporary recalibration. This is not a pause. It is a full-scale retreat, a regime collapse. And it’s not just DEI that is falling. On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and founder of Amazon, announced that the paper’s opinion pages will now be dedicated to defending “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos declared that opposing viewpoints can be “published elsewhere.” The left’s hold on our cultural institutions is being broken just as its hold on corporate America and Washington, D.C. has fallen. Of course, no entrenched ideology surrenders overnight. DEI has spent years embedding itself into corporate HR departments, government agencies, and university bureaucracies. The activists, consultants, and executives who built their careers around it will fight to preserve it. They will litigate, regulate, and pressure corporations to reverse course. They will frame this retreat as a “temporary setback” rather than a lasting correction. But the problem for DEI’s defenders is that preference cascades, once set in motion, do not reverse themselves easily. The same companies that once feared activist outrage now fear consumer backlash and shareholder scrutiny. The political winds have changed, the legal landscape has shifted, and the economic incentives are no longer in DEI’s favor. And this retreat from DEI and related left-wing policies is not just a political reaction. It is a structural correction. The same forces that fueled the rise of these policies—activist pressure, legal blind spots, and corporate groupthink—have now collapsed under the weight of scrutiny. Which means this shift is unlikely to be reversed. Unlike the left-wing ideological wave of 2020—which was fueled by emotion, activism, and media hype—this movement is driven by lawsuits, economic reality, and consumer behavior. DEI was an imposed orthodoxy, sustained by the fear of bad PR and the inertia of corporate groupthink. Once that spell is broken, there’s no putting it back together.

Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) is increasing access to international wealth products for Thai investors, aiming to expand assets under management (AUM) in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026. Under its wealth management division, SCB Wealth, the bank collaborates with subsidiaries of parent SCB X and global partners to drive business growth. According to chief executive Kris Chantanotoke, the bank offers a diverse range of global asset classes to facilitate Thai investors entering international markets. SCB's plan to expand its AUM in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026 aligns with projections that Thai wealth will grow to roughly US$1 trillion in the interim. The bank declined to disclose its current AUM and the total wealth of its Thai investors. According to Mr Kris, SCB X's subsidiaries and the bank's global partners supporting this business segment comprise SCB Asset Management, Innovest X, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, SCB Julius Baer, and its latest partner BlackRock. SCB Wealth serves three market segments: SCB Private, SCB First and SCB Prime. SCB Wealth offers a comprehensive suite of investment products and services, including deposits, lending, investments, estate planning, protection and tax planning. In addition to its existing wealth clients, the bank extends its services to "mass affluent" clients interested in portfolio investments, granting them access to global asset classes. Investment access is tailored to client needs, with options available through relationship managers or digital platforms. SCB wants to double AUM under its customer-centric investment theme by 2026 from 70 billion baht at present. The bank also plans to double the proportion of active wealth management clients investing through its digital platform, increasing their share to 30% of the total customer portfolio. "We aim to position SCB Wealth as the industry leader in terms of assets under advisory," said Mr Kris. SCB Wealth also introduced a unique investment model called "No Gain, No Pay" for select investment themes. Under this approach, if clients fail to achieve their targeted returns, the bank will waive the investment fees.

The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 6% in 24 hours to break below $84,000 on Wednesday. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched its lowest levels since November 2024, when it rose amid election momentum. According to crypto and stocks trader IncomeSharks, the market is bearish. BTC sold-off as the crypto market reacted to trade war sentiment, with this coming on the heels of the latest tariffs announcement by President Donald Trump. Having announced that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China will go into effect in April, Trump said he would slap 25% tariffs on the European Union. The news saw the S&P 500 fall, with over $500 billion in market cap wiped off. As equities reacted to the potential trade war, Bitcoin crashed below $84,000. Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC hit lows of $82,131. BTC price also dumped amid massive selling pressure from ETFs. Major issuers Fidelity, Ark and Grayscale all sold. BlackRock, which sent millions of dollars worth of BTC and ETH to an exchange on Tuesday, also offloaded $150 million of the flagship coin.

Title: Republicans labeled BlackRock as 'woke.' Here's a brief history of how the firm has tried to shed that description.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-removes-dei-wording-annual-review-larry-fink-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-26T20:43:06Z
Full Content:
Many big American companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's pushback on DEI, but none of their steps carry more symbolic weight than a retreat by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. An early advocate of diversity, equity, and inclusion, BlackRock has removed all mention of the strategy from its latest annual report. The asset manager and its CEO, Larry Fink, have over the years become targets for Republicans who claim the firm is too "woke." What was the DEI section in the asset manager's last report has now been reframed as "connectivity and inclusivity" in the Tuesday filing. Last year, it said that it believed "a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success." This year it avoided mentioning the acronym or a diverse workforce, just "diverse perspectives." When reached for comment, a BlackRock spokesman referred to the new paragraph in its annual report that said the firm's approach to "building a connected and inclusive culture is aligned with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives. Delivering for the firm's clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. "BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink." BlackRock has also removed references to a three-pillar strategy, which included phrasing around cultivating a work environment where employees felt "seen, heard, valued, and respected." The firm left out a section that previously broke down its US employees by gender and ethnicity. In its 2023 annual review, it introduced the statistics with a line saying that "BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy." Companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's executive order on "radical and wasteful" DEI programs, though a few big names such as JPMorgan Chase and Costco have reaffirmed their commitment to diversity initiatives. Through his annual investor letters, Fink promoted stakeholder capitalism and environmental, social, and governance investing, becoming the unofficial corporate poster child for the movements. In the last few years, however, Fink has had to tone down his support for ESG and defend against the idea that the firm has an ideological agenda it's forcing on the many companies it invests in through its mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also has critics on the political left. Climate activists have previously protested outside Fink's home and BlackRock's New York headquarters, calling for a divestment from fossil fuels. "The only agenda we have is delivering for our clients," he said in 2023 LinkedIn post, which he drafted as a response to being called the "king of the woke industrial complex" in a Republican Party presidential candidate debate. October 2017: Former Obama aide (and future Biden administration member) Brian Deese is named head of sustainable investments. November 2017: As part of a panel at the New York Times DealBook conference, Fink was asked about how diversity and inclusion are becoming investment criteria. He responded by saying that hiring behaviors will have to change, and they're talking to companies about it. (The clip, where he said, "You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors," went viral among conservative circles in 2023.) November 2018: The world's largest asset manager asks Russell 1000 companies with less than two female board members to improve their gender diversity. January 2020: Fink's annual letter, coming out just months before the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York, stated the company's focus is now on "putting sustainability at the center of how we invest." Fink wrote that "ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability." June 2020: Gavin Lewis, a managing director at BlackRock in the UK, starts the #IAM campaign after George Floyd's murder in Minnesota, and Lewis, a Black man, becomes one of the most well-known advocates for people of color in finance. January 2021: Fink lays out the firm's DEI strategy in his annual letter, which includes more inclusive hiring practices as well as a focus on "racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities. April 2021: After a Minneapolis jury convicted police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in the death of George Floyd, Fink wrote on LinkedIn that he hoped the country could begin to heal. "At BlackRock, we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion through every aspect of our business. While we have made progress, we still have a great deal of work to do," he wrote. "This is a somber day and one for deep reflection. As I look to the future, I am committed to ensuring that BlackRock does its part to contribute to a more just and inclusive society." January 2022: Larry says that stakeholder capitalism is "not woke" in response to conservative politicians' criticism that the company is pushing its politics on companies through its heft. June 2023: Fink officially stopped using the acronym ESG because it was being politically "weaponized." Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he said he was ashamed to be part of the conversation and that ESG has been "misused by the far left and the far right." December 2023: In a debate for the GOP nomination for president, Vivek Ramaswamy called Fink "king of the woke industrial complex, the ESG movement, and the CEO of BlackRock, the most powerful company in the world." Fink responded in a LinkedIn post saying "We make decisions based on our clients' best interests, not political or ideological agendas." December 2024: Following Trump's election, BlackRock tones down the language on its board diversity policy. The updated policy removes a numerical target for gender diversity — which had previously been 30% of members being diverse, with at least two female directors and one director from an underrepresented group. A footnote suggests that BlackRock thinks 30% is still the expectation, but the updated policy also removed the need for companies to explain why their board is not more diverse. January 2025: The firm told clients it had withdrawn from the United Nations coalition Net Zero Asset Managers weeks before Trump's second inauguration. The firm's vice chair, Philipp Hildebrand, told clients that the coalition and other climate-related entanglements had "subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials" — a reference to lawsuits state attorneys general from oil-producing areas of the US such as Texas had filed against BlackRock over its stance on sustainable investing. These states though appear to be interested in more than just BlackRock's energy policies; Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to the asset manager, as well as other big-name financial firms, to understand their DEI policies.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/26/2025 11:27:04 AM PST by RandFan Keir Starmer has announced that Britain will “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending paid for by slashing the foreign aid budget. The move, just two days before the prime minister is due to meet Donald Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was pandering to the US president, and fury from aid groups that say it could cost lives in countries that rely on UK support. In a surprise announcement, Starmer announced the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, with the budget rising to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and an ambition to reach 3%. Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 40%, after Trump’s own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. Several warned in a cabinet meeting of the risk of unintended consequences. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US plan could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence.

Is Starmer here to brag and try to pull us in before the fighting starts? Did he just want to see Trumps middle finger up close? Did Trump summon him here to tell UK/EU how hardball is played? As one of you noted they recently changed some laws to let foreign money in and allow ownership by non-Ukrainians.

I guess it’s dawning on him that what goes around comes around and the UK may have to back up it’s bold moves in the recent past. Wouldn’t it be great if they elected someone on our side AND had a powerful military again? What I don’t get is that Europe spends over 300 billion a year on defense...that’s nothing to sneeze at...maybe they dont spend it well. I know it’s LOW as a percentage. But with all of their crying about Russia, these budgets should have produced something that could defend europe fairly well Fighting for peace is like f*****g for virginity “Slashes!” Elsewhere I read they’re going from 2.3 to 2.5 and will reduce foreign aid by 0.2 to compensate. Oh, the horror! Idk. One seems an impossibility. One offers hope? Maybe a slight distinction. Interesting thought tho. Thx . These people are insane. Let them burn, we should have NEVER bailed them out of “The Great War”, or WW II if it would have even happened. If BritAID is as pernicious as USAID, the world will be a better place without it.

Title: Owners of McSorley’s in Ranelagh finalising deal to take over Wild Goose restaurant

The new owners of well-known McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh are finalising a deal to take over the Wild Goose restaurant space above the pub, with a view to making it a seven-days-a-week food and drinks business. In an interview with Inside Business, a podcast by The Irish Times, publican Noel Anderson, the managing director of Grand Slam Bars, said: “Our plan would be to grow it more as a seven day a week business. We’ve just done a deal with the guy who runs a restaurant upstairs. We’re taking that back, the deal is just being finalised. “We plan on putting our own food into it, growing the food trade there, growing the cocktail trade and having a super events space upstairs. We’re excited about that.” He said the fit-out would cost hundreds of thousands of euro. “But I think it will be worth it. We own the building, it’s a long-term investment and we’re excited about what the future holds in Ranelagh.” The restaurant is currently occupied by the Wild Goose Grill, which is run by proprietor Kevin McMahon and is slated to close at the end of March. McSorley’s was purchased for €5.5 million in the middle of last year by Grand Slam Bars, which is owned by Mr Anderson and former Irish rugby internationals, Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O’Brien. They also own The Bridge 1859 in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock pub, and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon venues in the city centre. The group employs more than 200 staff with combined revenues of about €11 million, Mr Andseron said. Food makes up about €4m million a year of its turnover. “Food is a big part of what we do now and that’s probably a lot of where the future lies,” he said. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager. Mr Anderson said McSorleys would continue be a “late focused” bar but having the space upstairs. “What’s exciting for us is that on big rugby days you will get business all day and all night as well,” he said.

Title: BlackRock, Bank of America drop DEI policies amid White House’s war on ‘woke’

BlackRock and Bank of America dropped their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies — becoming the latest Wall Street giants to scrap the controversial initiative after the White House declared war on woke in corporate America. Regulatory filings reviewed by The Post show that Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.4 trillion under management, and the Brian Moynihan-led lender have axed language that promoted the representation and participation of different minority groups. The moves follow a crackdown led by President Donald Trump on DEI in the workplace, tasking Attorney General Pam Bondi in a Jan. 21 executive order that asked her to stamp out the practice. Bondi then vowed in a Feb. 5 memo that her DOJ would “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” such policies in the private sector. BlackRock, in its latest annual report filed late Tuesday, said that the company’s business “requires attracting the best people from across the world.” “BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink,” the report added. That represents a huge climbdown for the Democrat-donating CEO, who joined the chorus of Wall Street executives backing DEI in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the Black Lives Matter movement. In a letter to shareholders in 2021, Fink claimed: “To truly drive change, we must embed DEI into everything we do.” The Post has reached out to Blackrock for comment. BofA also backed off the much-criticized DEI policies in its annual report filed on Tuesday evening, formally ending the requirements for hiring and interviewing bankers. “We are deliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone hasthe opportunity to achieve their career goals,” the Charlotte-based firm wrote. A rep for Bank of America confirmed that was no longer company policy. “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions, and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a bank spokesperson said. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” The rollback of DEI by the two giants of American finance echoes what some of their rivals have been doing since Trump trounced Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 in the race for the White House. Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have also scaled back their DEI commitments, while Goldman Sachs recently canceled a requirement to only take companies public if they had two diverse board members. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon seemingly remains an outlier, insisting on Monday that nation’s largest bank would stand by its diversity policies, despite lashing out at DEI initiatives in a leaked recording of a town hall meeting with Chase employees. Dimon told the audience that he “was never a firm believer in bias training” and blasted how the company was “spending money on some of this stupid shit.” The Wall Street giant also scrubbed much of its DEI language in its recent annual report to investors, further confirming the shift in mood at America’s major banks. “Everyone in my industry wants diversity in their teams and a workplace that reflects society at large, but everybody on Wall Street privately agrees that the DEI doctrine had started to actually go too far. People have been afraid to speak up,” said Dan McCarthy, a veteran Wall Street headhunter and CEO of the specialist global search firm, One Search. “My clients are still hiring diversity and they are telling us that they want to continue to hire diversity,” McCarthy, the head of the Young Women Into Finance non-profit, added. “But some DEI policies became toxic to the point where they became discriminatory. It feels like we are starting to see more common sense around it.” Advertisement

Title: Wall Street’s DEI Retreat: Where Major Banks and Asset Managers Stand

As Wall Street navigates the shifting landscape of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), some firms quietly retreat while others make just enough adjustments to sidestep political backlash. Bank of America (BAC), BlackRock (BLK) and Citigroup (C) have publicly scaled back DEI commitments, while Capital One (COF) appears to be walking a fine line, paring down efforts without making headlines. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), on the other hand, remains committed to broad DEI goals but is cutting back on certain spending. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Much like Big Tech companies, the financial sector embraced DEI in 2020 amid national protests over racial justice, pledging to address systemic disparities through hiring initiatives and investment strategies. However, with shifting political climates, banks are reassessing those commitments. The pressure is mounting as the Trump administration signals its intent to dismantle DEI initiatives across industries, from finance to education. Here’s how recent filings and statements from major U.S. banks and asset managers reveal a broader industry shift away from DEI: In its annual report filed yesterday (Feb. 25), the world’s largest asset manager deleted references to its “three pillar DEI strategy,” which included diversity commitments in talent and culture, client and business partnerships, and social impact and policy. Instead, the report included a statement, under a new section called “connectivity and inclusivity,” saying the firm is “committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.” Bank of America, which also filed its annual report yesterday, removed all references to “diversity and inclusion” mentioned in its 2023 report. In a few places, the bank replaced the word “diversity” with “opportunity.” For example, the “diversity and inclusion group” under the bank’s human resources department has been renamed “opportunity and inclusion group.” “We have diversity and inclusion at our company. But, step back: We’ve always been the bank of opportunity,” CEO Brian Moynihan said at an event in Washington D.C. yesterday when asked about the bank’s DEI policy. In its latest annual report, U.S. Bank’s parent company, U.S. Bancorp, quietly removed the previous year’s overview of its DEI efforts, including the mention of its business resource groups, which supported minority employees. It also removed a pledge that the bank would include at least one woman or person of color on interview slates for all roles. The bank also scrubbed its staff diversity data. The previous year, the document specified that 57 percent of its U.S. employees were women and 39 percent were people of color. The latest filing had no such mention. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that U.S. Bancorp is about to have its first woman of color CEO. The bank’s president, Gunjan Kedia, who is Indian American, is set to take over as CEO in April. In a “Colleague Engagement Update” published Feb. 20, Citigroup announced it “will no longer have aspirational representation goals except as required by local law.” The bank also said it will no longer require diverse slates of candidates and interviewers. The move is a direct result of recent changes in U.S. federal government policy, Citigroup said. Morgan Stanley (MS)’s latest annual report didn’t include the “Diversity and Inclusion” section that was featured in previous years’ filings. However, the report retains a link to the company’s “Diversity & Inclusion” landing page, which is still live. The bank’s only DEI-related statements are nested under a section dubbed “Human Capital,” which contains the stated value of committing to “diversity and inclusion” but now also mentions “meritocracy”—a call to President Trump’s advocacy for “merit-based opportunities” across industries. Similarly, Capital One’s latest annual report also no longer features the previous year’s “Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” (DIB) section. While a brief mention of “pay equity” remains, the bank’s promise to pay women and employees of color “100 percent” what men and White employees are paid is notably absent. Capital One’s website still features a “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” statement and a “Supplier Diversity Program,” whose goal is “to include qualified diverse businesses in every sourcing opportunity based on commodity need wherever these suppliers exist.” JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., firmly sticks to its DEI commitments despite political pressure. In its latest annual report, the bank said it “has been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).” However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that some DEI programs are wasteful and said the bank would scale back spending on them while maintaining its broader DEI commitments. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (GS) states on its website that it remains “committed to making progress toward racial equity, advancing gender equality, and increasing representation at every level of our firm.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Thanks to Sarah Lamont and Jaylen Darling for their contributions Everyone talks about the $84.4T great wealth transfer in the context of liquid assets expected to be passed down over the next 20 years. However, fewer people are addressing the $15.5T in private business wealth that is much more operationally complex and obviously harder to inherit. SBA Office of Advocacy, Cerulli Associates, Federal Reserve, F-Prime Analysis Despite retirement-aged owners (boomers and older) owning 63.1 percent ($9.78T) of the private business wealth — $4.25T of which we estimate is distributed amongst small business owners with less than 500 employees — the inherent problems of transferring this portion of wealth creates ample market opportunity for startups in this space to address. For instance, only about 52 percent of heirs claim to actually want the family business which is exacerbated by the fact that the smaller the business, the less likely owners are to engage in exit planning. Stats like these suggest that many retiring SMB owners will need to consider alternative exit strategies outside of passing down their business to their children. More and more retiring owners will likely be selling their business to external buyers, which comes with a vast amount of challenges and pain points for both sellers and buyers. The challenges and pain points that SMB sellers and buyers face are vast: F-Prime Analysis Numerous players are adding value along the process of business ownership transfer from document preparation to deal execution. Acquisition marketplaces like Beacon, Get Acquired, and Tresle are aggregating demand and providing value through free valuation estimation calculators, access to advisors that facilitate deal transactions, and an anonymous listings platform that allows sellers to “match” with and approve prospective buyer inquiries. Companies like Boom are supporting companies in the early selling phase, helping owners with key management issues and valuation services to get businesses ready for the marketplace. Baton which just raised $10M in Series A funding and Tresle’s Plus product offers custom marketing assets for sellers; Beacon vets their buyers even going so far as to conduct background checks in specific cases; and Baton and Acquire.com provide a virtual “data room” to standardize document review and initial due diligence. Buyer-focused acquisition marketplaces are also providing unique value-adds. Companies like Private Market Labs leverage AI to gather a database of on-market small business deals for buyers. OffDeal leverages AI to match and connect buyers with the best off-market acquisition targets. Village Wellth boasts a financing solutions product, Aquirewell, that links buyers with advisors to review financials and structure deals as well as assess their lending readiness and find the best lending options by connecting them with multiple lenders. Boopos offers acquisition financing loans for recurring revenue businesses. Alternatively, business owners who don’t want to sell their business to external buyers can consider employee ownership transfer as an alternative exit strategy. Employee ownership as an exit strategy refers to an owner selling their majority stake in the business to the employees either directly or indirectly. There are multiple types of employee ownership structures with the most common model in the US being Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), with over 6,000 companies and favorable tax incentives. While each employee ownership type has its own tax and governance incentives, across the board employee ownership has shown to be a viable and compelling exit strategy that results in a preserved legacy and company culture and potential for ongoing involvement or gradual transition for the selling owner going through an already emotional process of selling their business. Common Trust is one startup that is taking advantage of the market opportunity by helping owners design and execute an employee ownership buyout using a customized purpose trust — an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) — that is cheaper than its more regulated ESOP counterpart. Startups in the space have the opportunity to get in front of selling owners who value company legacy preservation, tax benefits, and the flexibility of selling internally vs to external buyers. F-Prime Analysis On the other hand, the not-so-pretty side of business ownership transfer is that not all of them succeed. Companies like SimpleClosure and Sunset are addressing the clean up process for a sliver of the 80 percent of businesses that don’t survive by efficiently managing the dissolution process for owners. Traditional expectations of business owners to pass down their companies beyond generations are insufficient to deal with the impending demand of millions of business owners seeking retirement over the next decade. While the private business wealth transfer is well over trillions of dollars, numerous startups are adding value for selling owners and prospective buyers that are cheaper and more efficient than a traditional broker and go beyond a standard classified ad posting. The business wealth transfer space has never been more exciting, yet it needs serious investment in new infrastructure to scale and improve the investor experience. For entrepreneurs who’ve also spotted this opportunity, now is an opportune time to build category-defining companies. At F-Prime, we have been partnering with the builders of fintech infrastructure for more than 50 years, including early investments in Alibaba, Flywire, Toast, Quove/Plaid, Vestwell, and FutureAdvisor/BlackRock. We could not be more excited by the opportunity we see in business ownership transfer, and the chance to partner with the founders who will define this category. Here, we’ve outlined one view of how this industry is shaping up.

Title: Starmer: “Selling Britain by the Pound”

In 1973, the rock band Genesis titled their album ‘Selling England by the Pound’. They did so for various reasons. The phrase was taken from a Labour Party slogan of the time, reflecting the album’s critique of Britain’s changing identity and economic challenges in the early 1970s. The title symbolised the loss of traditional English culture due to ‘Americanisation’, such as increasing commercialism, consumerism and materialism. It also referred to the UK’s economic struggles, including inflation, industrial disputes and debates about joining the European Economic Community. And the title used a pun on ‘pound’ as both currency and weight, emphasising the commercialisation of British identity. Much has changed in the 52 years since that album was released. There is not much left of Britain to sell after decades of neoliberal globalisation. It has been a long journey since Thatcher’s privatisation-deindustrialisation-deregulation agenda of the 1980s. Successive governments have continued to push through that agenda, and Kier Starmer, current prime minister and handmaiden to elite interests, is no different. Image: Keir Starmer at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, 19 January. Congress Centre – Congress Hall. (Copyright: World Economic Forum / Benedikt von Loebell / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) In 2023, prior to coming to power, Kier Starmer attended the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual get-together in Davos. While there, with BlackRock in attendance, he declared that Britain was open for business. In a 2023 BBC interview, Starmer stated that he preferred Davos to parliament, explaining his preference by saying that Westminster is “too constrained” and “closed,” describing it as a “tribal shouting place”. Starmer said that at Davos he can “engage with people that you can see working with in the future”. Starmer prefers to engage with unaccountable, unelected global elites — the Davos crowd — rather than domestic parliamentary processes. At Davos, he stated that energy independence required an “active state”. But this does not mean nationalisation or public ownership. It involves using public money and leveraging the machinery of state to facilitate the needs of private capital. Starmer has a habit of saying all the things global capital wants to hear. In late 2024, Starmer posted on X: “I’m determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets. This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalize on the UK’s position as a world-leading hub for investment.” Starmer met with Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, and expressed enthusiasm about partnering with the company. Furthermore, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated in a letter that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. And how will the face of “our” UK be changed? Image: Official portrait of Claudia Webbe MP (Licensed under CC BY 3.0) In December 2024, writing in the UK’s Morning Star newspaper, Claudia Webbe, former Member of Parliament, noted that BlackRock’s $10 trillion portfolio is more than the GDP of every country in the world except for the US and China. In her piece, she quotes Labour Member of Parliament Clive Lewis’s response to Starmer’s meeting with BlackRock. Lewis stated that instead of explaining how — 40 years of atomising, neoliberal plunder, the selling-off of and destruction of public services, the undermining of democracy, the hollowing out and selling off of natural resources at the hands of companies like BlackRock and other price-gouging corporations, billionaires and financial institutions — has led us to this point, the Labour Party has become the defender of elite interests. Webbe notes that BlackRock regards the future of the UK in terms of further cuts to welfare, more austerity and the further driving-down of wages, pensions and social security benefits. She adds that Starmer’s gushing about the government’s “partnership” with BlackRock may have been the trigger for wider public awareness and anger, but it was only the tip that gives away the iceberg of mass privatisation and intensified austerity that the Labour government is planning. BlackRock is a publicly owned investment manager that primarily provides its services to institutional, intermediary and rich individual investors. The firm exists to put its assets to work to make money for its clients. And it must ensure the financial system functions to secure this goal. And this is exactly what it does (see Black Rock’s War on Humanity here). Take food and agriculture, for instance. Many farmers and rural communities are worried about the potential threat of large asset management firms buying up agricultural land, especially following the British government’s proposed changes to inheritance tax on farms, set to take effect in April 2026. The new policy will impose a 20% inheritance tax on farms valued at more than £1 million, where they were previously exempt. The concern is that family farms in particular will be forced to sell up and get out of farming. This would certainly suit financial investors that regard farmland as a lucrative asset class. In the last couple of decades, farmland has become a tradable commodity (see The Commodification of Farmland here). Agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. The financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to stagnation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. Bellamy says we have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource that supports food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity (once farmland is bought up, think of its role in the so-called BlackRock-driven ‘green transition’ — solar panels and wind farms throughout the countryside). An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated land prices. Aside from profiting from war, death and destruction, BlackRock is also heavily invested in the success of the prevailing globalised system of food and agriculture and profits from an inherently predatory food regime that is responsible for a cascade of environmental, social and health catastrophes, including poor-quality food and widespread illness. . Environmental activists, including global interfaith organization GreenFaith and Extinction Rebellion, protest BlackRock’s shareholder meeting on May 31, 2022. (Licensed under CC BY 2.0) . But why should Larry Fink care about this? Poor health is good for business. Scroll through BlackRock’s website and it soon becomes clear that it sees the healthcare sector as a strong long-term bet. Morality or conscience doesn’t come into it. Ordinary people are regarded as collateral damage or as digits on a computer screen to be rinsed for profit or plundered for gain. Hard-nosed billionaire and businessman Larry Fink, with the help of facilitator-in-chief Starmer, sees a golden opportunity to further hollow out Britain for the benefit of global finance. The criticism that Keir Starmer lacks vision is too kind. His vision, if we can call it that, seems to be selling Britain by the pound — a metaphorical fire sale of remaining national assets and potential while struggling to articulate a compelling narrative for the future to ordinary people. Starmer’s leadership is more about managing decline than charting a new course, despite his talk of making Britain a global leader in AI, an area in which the US and China are already well ahead. After years of Conservative austerity and Brexit turmoil, Britain now has another unpopular prime minister who seems content to peddle its future piece by piece. When Starmer stated that he is determined to “deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets”, do you think he was actually referring to ordinary people? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Home Internet

How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: NASDAQ files for Grayscale’s Polkadot ETF – Is DOT’s public trading debut near?

Grayscale’s single-asset focus diverges from BlackRock and Fidelity’s diversified index-based crypto approaches. Grayscale has officially submitted a Form 19b-4 filing with NASDAQ to launch the Grayscale Polkadot Trust. It is expanding its crypto investment offerings for institutional investors to gain exposure to the Polkadot [DOT] ecosystem. This application follows Grayscale’s expansion into altcoin ETFs, with similar filings for Solana [SOL], Litecoin [LTC], XRP, Dogecoin [DOGE], and Cardano [ADA]. The filing is now subject to review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has 45 days to decide whether to approve, deny, or extend its evaluation. If approved, the ETF would offer institutional and retail investors a regulated means of gaining exposure to Polkadot without directly purchasing or storing DOT tokens. Market reactions to the filing have been swift, with analysts and industry commentators debating its significance. On X (formerly Twitter), reactions have varied. A crypto market observer described the filing as “huge” for institutional liquidity and predicted it could expand Polkadot’s market reach. However, not everyone shared this enthusiasm. Source: X A user questioned the role of institutional capital in crypto, humorously suggesting that it felt like – “Someone’s trying to steal my lunch money.” Polkadot’s price has responded positively, despite broader market turbulence. As of 26th of February, DOT was trading at $4.74, a 0.90% increase over the last 24 hours. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced sharp declines, with BTC down 6.25% and ETH losing 6.05% in the same period. Source: CoinMarketCap Polkadot’s ability to hold steady while other assets experience losses suggests growing investor confidence, potentially fueled by the ETF speculation. Over the past week, DOT has been on a rollercoaster ride. It peaked at $5.30 on 21st of February before plummeting to a support level of $4.22 by 25th of February. The subsequent rebound aligns closely with buzz surrounding Grayscale’s ETF filing. Trading volume surged to $492.94 million, hinting at heightened interest and the possibility of an approval-fueled rally. Still, caution remains as investors await the SEC’s decision. Quite recently, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s Spot Cardano ETF filing, signaling growing regulatory interest in single-asset altcoin ETFs. While this acknowledgment is not an outright approval, it marks a critical first step. Grayscale’s strategy diverges from that of more traditional asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who typically pursue diversified index-style products. Instead, Grayscale concentrates on single-asset trusts, allowing investors targeted exposure to specific cryptocurrencies without the complexities of direct asset custody. Polkadot, much like Solana and Litecoin, benefits from both decentralization and an active developer ecosystem, factors that enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Bloomberg analysts, including Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have long tracked regulatory sentiment toward altcoin ETFs. Their assessments give Litecoin a 90% approval probability, Dogecoin 75%, Solana 70%, and XRP 65%. Source: X Polkadot and Hedera still carry an uncertain “maybe” status, indicating that the SEC’s stance on these assets is less clear. The coming weeks will be a litmus test not just for Polkadot’s ETF proposal, but also for the broader trajectory of altcoin ETFs in the United States. For investors and analysts, all eyes are on the regulators. If Polkadot’s ETF application follows in Cardano’s footsteps of formal acknowledgment—and possibly, approval—it could shift the market’s focus toward altcoin-specific products.

Apple Inc. became the latest company in the list of tech giants who have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in US investments, which President Donald Trump claims credit for. The iPhone maker said that it will spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, hire 20,000 new employees and produce AI serves domestically. An hour after Apple's announcement, Donald Trump said that the company was spending in the US because it has “faith in what we are doing.” However, Apple didn’t directly attribute its investments to the Trump administration. According to Bloomberg, the plan itself isn’t far off from what Apple had previously said it would spend. Since Trump came to the White House as the President eight years ago, corporate pledges have seen taking shape. Now, corporates are revisiting this tradition as the Republican returns to the Oval Office for a second time. Around the start of Trump’s first term eight years ago, Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. made a commitment to invest $50 billion in the US that, it said, would create 50,000 jobs. Foxconn Technology Group and Intel Corp. were among others that handed Trump spending plans to tout — despite the fact that some were clearly in the works long before he took office. Here are some of the major tech investments announced since Donald Trump returned as the US President: Announced: $500 billion domestically over the next four years Previously: Apple was already expected to spend $10.8 billion on capital expenditures this year. Its operating expenses totaled $57.5 billion in 2024. Jobs: 20,000 Location: Houston and Detroit On Monday, Apple announced what the company described as its biggest US commitment to date. The tech giant is planning to hire 20,000 new workers, produce AI servers in the US and altogether spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years. Investments will include the opening of a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country. The announcement came days after Trump and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met, after which Trump suggested that Cook planned to invest “hundreds of billions of dollars.” Announced: As much as $500 billion Previously: Stargate is a new JV, but OpenAI had been pitching a plan for a massive data center build-out in the US for months, initially to the Biden administration Jobs: “Hundreds of thousands” Location: Texas, initially On Jan. 21 — the day after Trump was inaugurated — ChatGPT developer OpenAI, SoftBank and software giant Oracle Corp., announced a joint venture to develop AI infrastructure across the US. The firms said they plan to invest as much as $500 billion over the next four years — but are focused on a $100 billion deployment initially — on projects that they estimated would create “hundreds of thousands of American jobs.” Stargate’s first project is a data center complex that spans about 875 acres in Abilene, Texas, that will eventually be used to power AI systems. The joint venture marketed the project as a means of supporting the “reindustrialization of the United States” and protecting “the national security of America and its allies.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had been pitching the Biden administration on a massive AI infrastructure build-out last year. Announced: $100 billion Previously: SoftBank had been laying out plans for months to invest further in AI semiconductors, data centers and robots. Its Vision Fund invested $500 million in the leading US AI startup OpenAI and launched a $1.5 billion tender to buy more stock from OpenAI employees last year. Jobs: 100,000 Location: Texas, for one, through Stargate JV In December, Trump announced that SoftBank planned to invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years during an event alongside CEO Masayoshi Son. The plan includes a pledge to create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure, including investments in data centers, semiconductors and energy, according to a person familiar with the plan. The announcement immediately prompted the question of where the company will get the capital for its latest pledge. During Trump’s last term, Son was raising his $100 billion Vision Fund with money from outside investors and poured the cash into startups such as WeWork, Uber Technologies Inc. and DoorDash Inc. SoftBank doesn’t have the cash on hand to deliver on Son’s pledge this time. Announced: $65 billion Previously: Meta’s capital spending was expected to total nearly $60 billion this year. Its operating expenses topped $64 billion last year. Jobs: N/A Location: Louisiana, for one Meta Platforms Inc. plans to invest as much as $65 billion on projects related to artificial intelligence in 2025, including building a data center “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Facebook post on Jan. 24. Meta plans to bring around a gigawatt of computing power online in 2025 and is projected to end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the kind of chips critical to running AI systems, Zuckerberg said. He also said the company will “significantly” expand its AI teams, without quantifying the number of jobs to be created. Meta was already heavily investing in AI. Less than three months earlier, Zuckerberg had warned investors that Meta planned to “significantly accelerate” its capital spending in 2025 to bet on AI and the metaverse. The company had announced a $10 billion data center in Louisiana. Announced: Reiterated plans to invest more than $40 billion on US data centers Previously: All plans had already been announced Jobs: Estimated that AI will broadly help create the next “billion AI-enabled jobs” Location: States including Texas and Arizona Microsoft has yet to hand Trump a flashy announcement that he can take credit for. But its president, Brad Smith, did write a blog post in January to welcome Trump into the White House — and lay out investments it had already been planning. Among the plans he mentioned: Microsoft is on track to invest about $80 billion to build data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications, with more than half of that investment located in the US. Last year, the company announced that it would invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build “secure” AI and data center infrastructure. The company has previously disclosed plans to build data center capacity in states including Arizona and Texas. It’s also working with BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle to create an international investment fund to add up to $100 billion of additional funding for AI infrastructure and the AI supply chain. Announced: At least $20 billion Previously: Damac had already been laying the groundwork for a larger foray into the data centers business. Edgnex Data Centers, a unit of the Dubai-based conglomerate, had plans to invest $3 billion over the next three to five years in data centers in Southeast Asia. Jobs: “Thousands” Location: Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Hussain Sajwani, the head of Damac Group, wanted the world to know he was the US president’s man in the Middle East. The real estate billionaire thrust himself into the spotlight again in January, standing alongside Trump and promising an investment of at least $20 billion to build new US data centers from Arizona to Ohio. The details of how Sajwani — whose net worth has surged in recent years to about $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — will finance such an undertaking weren’t immediately apparent. Sajwani, who is likely to lean heavily on banks and other financial institutions for much of that investment, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Damac’s balance sheet would allow it to fund about 30%. Trump said the first phase of Damac’s plan would span Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana. Damac has said the investment is expected to create “thousands of jobs” where the data centers are built. Announced: $11 billion Previously: Amazon had laid out plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on new data centers long before Trump was elected. The company was already expected to drop nearly $100 billion on capital expenditures this year and had $243 billion in operating expenses last year. Jobs: At least 550 Location: Georgia In January, Amazon Web Services pledged to invest an estimated $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support AI and cloud technologies. The investment is expected to create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs, according to the company’s press release. As part of the investment plan, the company will build new data centers in Butts County, Russ Crumbley, chairman of the Butts County board of commissioners, said in the statement. Announced: Nearly $1 billion Previously: Anduril had already said in August 2024 that it was planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on a new facility. Jobs: 4,000 directly, and another 8,500 to sustain operations Location: Ohio Defense tech startup Anduril Industries Inc. announced in January that it had chosen Ohio as the location of a sprawling new manufacturing facility that will produce tens of thousands of autonomous systems and weapons annually. Co-founder Palmer Luckey had previously said he expected the California-based weapons technology startup to thrive under the Trump administration. Anduril aims to secure final approvals to begin modernizing an existing facility on-site in coming weeks, and expects to begin producing weapons by July 2026. Anduril expects to invest nearly $1 billion in the new facility, which it says will create 4,000 jobs directly, and another 8,500 jobs to sustain operations. The startup had been planning the new facility long before Trump was elected. In August 2024, after raising $1.5 billion in a new funding round, the company said it planned to spend hundreds of millions on the new site.

Title: Foreign Companies Bail Out of China’s Tottering Economy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/02/25/foreign-companies-bail-out-of-chinas-tottering-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:06:53Z
Full Content:
Foreign companies are pulling out of China’s weakened markets, demonstrating a clear lack of confidence in the Communist regime’s ability to stabilize the economy and avert a financial collapse. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Monday noted two more big names headed for the exits over the past two weeks: U.S. law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton this week became one of the latest companies to pull out of China, saying that it would close its office in Fortune Financial Center in Beijing’s bustling central business district in July. Last week, a BlackRock fund forfeited two office towers at Waterfront Place in Shanghai’s premier Lujiazui financial district to Standard Chartered after failing to repay a U.S. $780 million loan that was rolled over for more than a year. The world’s largest asset manager could not find a buyer even after offering a 30 per cent discount. Law firms and real-estate developers appear to be at the forefront of the exodus from China, but other industries are also considering their options as overall profits slipped by almost 18 percent over the past three years. Some foreign firms are evidently concerned that they cannot lower their prices enough to contend with domestic competitors, a concern made worse by the Chinese government’s tendency to bend the rules in favor of domestic companies. The SCMP found it easy to measure the size of the foreign exodus by looking at how much office space has suddenly become available in Beijing at cut-rate prices. Foreign companies make up about 20 percent of the market for office space in China’s capital city, and at the end of 2024, over 20 percent of that space had become vacant. Similar conditions could be seen in the office market for the trade hub of Shanghai, where analysts said 22.1 percent of office space is now vacant. At least ten Chinese cities have passed the “dangerous” threshold of 20 percent vacancy, and the vacancy rate is expected to grow at least 3 percent worse over the coming year. Some of the space vacated by departing Western multinationals is being taken by incoming Middle Eastern corporations, inspired by diplomatic and economic outreach from Beijing, including the investments that are still flowing out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for projects in the Middle East. Some analysts believe President Donald Trump’s crackdown on wasteful foreign aid will give China an opportunity to purchase more influence in the Middle East through BRI. The newcomers do not, as of yet, seem energetic enough to completely replace the U.S. and European companies China is losing. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) belatedly rolled out a twenty-point “action plan” last week to address the loss of direct foreign investment. The European Chamber of Commerce said last Thursday that China’s plan had some “positive” elements, provided the plan is “implemented in a manner that delivers tangible benefits for our members.” MOFCOM announced its plan shortly after China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange released a bombshell report showing that net foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by a whopping $168 billion in 2024, the largest decline since 1990.

Title: BlackRock’s $200M Coinbase deposit raises concerns over further liquidations

Share this article Today, BlackRock transferred 18,168 Ethereum ($44 million) and 1,800 Bitcoin ($160 million) to Coinbase amid growing market uncertainty and widespread liquidations in crypto markets. The deposit comes as Bitcoin fell below $86,000 for the first time since November, while crypto markets experienced $1.6 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Large entities moving significant amounts of crypto to exchanges are often seen as a signal that they may be preparing to sell. This trend can lead to further price drops, as other investors may interpret such moves as a sign of weakening confidence or an impending decline. Market pressure intensified following a $500 million Bitcoin ETF sell-off, coupled with renewed tariff threats from President Donald Trump. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to 25, indicating extreme fear and marking its lowest level since September 2024. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

February 25, 2025 13:08 ET | Source: ABC Labs ABC Labs SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reserve Index Protocol introduces DTFs, allowing anyone to create, trade, and redeem crypto index products with instant 24/7 access and real-time transparency. Today, ABC Labs, the team behind Reserve, launches their Reserve Index Protocol, which offers a first-of-its-kind, build-your-own ETF-like experience to crypto. The Index Protocol’s Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) bring everyday investors and institutions the one-click, easy-to-use experience they’ve become accustomed to since the S&P 500 ETF revolutionized the investing world in 1992. Starting today, 12 index-based DTFs are available, including the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, CoinDesk DeFi Select Index, and MarketVector Token Terminal Fundamental Index by Re7 Labs; the Virtuals Index by Virtuals Protocol; the RWA Index and Large Cap DeFi Index by MEV Capital; and the Alpha Base Index by Altcoinist.com; and more. With over 50,000 new tokens launching daily, DTFs simplify the process of investing in crypto by bundling tokens into broad, diversified crypto indexes or emerging thematic narratives that empower investors to tap into sectors like DeFi, real-world assets (RWA), AI, and memes without the guesswork. Anyone can create a new DTF, and anyone can mint or redeem its tokens 24/7 in a single click. “Our mission is to fight inflation and expand access to better financial products, and we firmly believe that crypto will be an integral part of the future financial landscape.” says Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs. “We built the Reserve Index Protocol to become a ‘decentralized BlackRock,’ which we believe will open up the floodgates of creativity. Plus, by partnering with some of the premier index creators in the world, people can now easily get one-click exposure to this growing industry alongside trusted brand names.”“The integration of the MarketVector’s indexes into Reserve’s DTF platform through our partnership with Re7 Labs is an exciting moment for institutional-grade crypto indexing. By combining MarketVector’s proven methodology with Reserve’s trusted, permissionless infrastructure, we’re making regulated, professional-grade indexes more accessible while maintaining the transparency that institutional and retail investors demand,” says Martin Leinweber, Director of Digital Asset Research & Strategy at MarketVector Indexes. Like an ETF, each DTF unit is redeemable 1:1 for its underlying basket of assets. However, redemption happens via a smart contract, so anyone—not just authorized participants & market makers—can redeem. The underlying tokens remain in this contract, eliminating the need for a centralized custodian. Because DTFs operate on smart contracts, they can be governed by a decentralized body instead of a centralized investment company. The Reserve Index Protocol also adds a powerful new incentive mechanism where creators are given more control over how fees from native tokens launched on the Reserve Index Protocol are divided up. This incentive approach allows DTF creators to form teams, raise capital, offer liquidity incentives, and so on. “While ETFs revolutionized thematic investing, DTFs are completely redefining it. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with onchain indexes, unlocking potential that was previously unimaginable. With Reserve’s Index Protocol, this is just the beginning,” says Connor Milner, Partnerships at Re7 Labs.

Title: Dark night for Germany: Elections will change little, and nothing for the better

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory For anyone following German politics, it may be counterintuitive, but things can get even worse. It is true: The “traffic light” coalition that finally imploded last November has left behind a stunning, all-along-the-line record of political, economic, and moral failure. Including but not limited to blindly and self-destructively supporting America’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, deindustrializing the German economy, and leading German society in siding with Israel, while the latter is committing genocide – according to both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International – against the Palestinians and going on a rampage among its neighbors. Hard to beat for awfulness, you may well think. And yet after the German election results are in, there are good reasons to be pessimistic, even if it is true that the parties that made up the “traffic light” coalition of doom had their richly deserved comeuppance. The Greens (usually well-off right-wing militarists and vegan woke pronoun sectarians) declined from 14.7% at the last federal elections in 2021 to less than 11.7%, a painful loss for a minor party past its heyday, especially given that it would have been worse without the personal – if inexplicable – popularity of top candidate Robert Habeck. Yet the former minister of the economy – really and in effect, of deindustrialization and recession – seems miffed at having been underappreciated and has promised to no longer claim a leading position in his party. For the SPD (Centrist social-democrats specializing in political insipidness and obsequious obedience to Washington), the punishment was worse; indeed, it was truly catastrophic: With 16.1%, the party notched up its worst result in post-World War II German history. In a longer perspective, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s almost Wagnerian downfall is even more sensational: With SPD forerunner organizations dating back to the 1860s – yes, that would be before the first German unification – this was the party’s worst showing since 1887. And that statistic includes an election in March 1933, when the SPD was already suffering massive Nazi repression: even then, the predecessors of Scholz and co. did better (18.3%). Finally, the FDP (tax-phobic free market doctrinaires) outdid the SPD by getting wiped out so completely it is gone from parliament. It may never return. Its de facto leader Martin Lindner has already announced not only – Habeck-style – his retreat from leadership but from politics as such. Call the above a quantum of justice if you wish. But the election has also featured a great injustice, namely what happened to the left-wing BSW party under Sahra Wagenknecht. Germany has an electoral threshold of 5%. Parties that achieve less are not represented in the federal parliament. The BSW has failed to pass this minimum by an extremely small margin: Garnering 4.97%, it lacked only 13,400 votes. This may be a legitimate result: as Wagenknecht has acknowledged, the party did have real problems to overcome and made quite a few mistakes as well. Yet the BSW is right to seek a verification of this intriguingly close defeat and is considering legal steps. Fabio de Masi, one of its prominent parliamentarians, has posted about “disinformation,” irregularities in the election process, and “Romanian conditions,” a clear allusion to the recent suppression of an “inconvenient” presidential candidate there. While any legal challenge is likely to run into unyielding stonewalling, there is already no doubt that, as Wagenknecht claims, mainstream media have run a long and intense smear campaign against the BSW. Misleading or fake opinion and exit polls – including by the major pollster FORSA (traditionally close to the SPD) – have also, Wagenknecht plausibly argues, helped discourage potential BSW voters. The reason for these dirty tricks is obvious: in neo-McCarthyite style, the party has been systematically maligned as subservient to Russia simply because it wants peace in Ukraine. That the BSW has been the only German party to object to Israel’s genocide has made it even more of a target. The winner of the election is, of course, the conservative CDU (CSU in Bavaria) under ex-BlackRock globalist, hard-right Atlanticist, and fanatically pro-Zionist Friedrich Merz. He is now the chancellor-elect. Yet, in reality, the CDU result of not even 29% is nothing to write home about. It’s enough to win, but definitely too little to boast about. Long gone are the days of heavyweight Helmut Kohl who regularly scored in the 34-38% range. Indeed, the only time when Kohl netted a result similar to Merz’s current one was in 1998, i.e., when he was in obvious decline. The two parties that can really congratulate themselves are Die Linke (The Left) and the Alternative For Germany (AfD) under Alice Weidel. The Left, strongly rebounding from a period of demoralization, captured almost 8% of the vote and the AfD, doubling its 2021 result, nearly 21%. That is as predicted by polls; so, Elon Musk’s clumsy last-minute intervention definitely did not help; it may even have hurt the party in the end. Yet for the AfD, this still marks a historic breakthrough (and I write this without political sympathy): It is simply a fact that the AfD is now the second-strongest party in Germany. The only, fundamentally dubious reason that it will – most likely – not participate in government is that all other parties, including the CDU, insist on treating it as a pariah. Citizens may vote for it – and in ever larger numbers – but the traditional parties claim the privilege of excluding it by a “firewall” (a concept unknown to the constitution, of course) from the ordinary process of coalition-making that really allocates power in Berlin. Whatever you think about their reasons for doing so, it is a hard fact that the mainstream parties are thereby treating the AfD as a second-class party and therefore its voters as second-class voters. In that regard, a recent poll finding is relevant: As Germany’s thoroughly mainstream conservative paper of record Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is reporting, the AfD can no longer be understood as a mere “party of protest.” Instead, its voters mean it when they support it. Their decision is genuine and authentic, whether you like it or not. And the AfD now also has the highest share of voters who are either workers or unemployed. Finally, the AfD is still especially strong, indeed dominant in the former East Germany. Put all of the above together and it is obvious that discriminating against the AfD promotes social and regional polarization. Indeed, not treating Weidel’s party as a normal member of the Berlin club undermines German unity. As things are, Germany will probably see the establishment of yet another “great coalition” between the CDU and SPD. Even while the latter has been diminished as literally never before, together the two still have enough parliamentary seats to govern. The AfD, in any case, is reiterating that it is ready for a coalition with the CDU, which would have a solid, indeed bigger majority and a shared view of the world. For, even if the mainstream conservatives of the CDU are loath to admit it, very little separates them ideologically from the AfD. Indeed, as one smart observer has plausibly argued, in terms of ideology, the true share of the “far-right” vote in this election was 60% - including the CDU, the AfD, and the Greens as well. Yet since the real conflict between the CDU and the AfD is not over “values” but electoral turf and ultimately survival as the go-to for Germany’s future right/far-right vote, their coalition is not likely to happen, not yet. That will leave the AfD, for now, as the most powerful opposition party and free to profit from the predictable dysfunction and self-blockade that the CDU and SPD will, once again, inflict on Germany. By 2029 – or earlier in case of another government collapse – Weidel’s party will find itself in an excellent position to break into government, perhaps even dominate it. In that sense, the AfD has every reason to be optimistic now: one way or the other, the election results and their consequences will play into its hands. But as to the rest of Germany, they won’t be so lucky. For three reasons: First, reduce bureaucracy as you will, raise or lower taxes to your heart’s content, keep talking about initiative and hard work and all that – none of it will overcome Germany’s abysmal economic decline. Except you also address two key issues: namely how to reform or better abolish the so-called “debt brake” that paralyzes economic policy and how to rebuild a pragmatic, normal relationship with Russia, including inexpensive energy for German industry and access to cooperation and markets for German business. Regarding the debt brake, a CDU-SPD coalition would have enough parliamentarians to govern but not to change the constitution. Yet that is what is needed to make a difference there. Hence, not only will the two coalition partners block and sabotage each other; they will also be unable to find enough support from the opposition. And if a compromise should be cobbled together, rely on it: it will be worthless since ineffective. Regarding Russia: Merz and his CDU have already signaled that they intend to be even more belligerent than the “traffic light” coalition. As far as they can imagine loosening the self-strangulating debt brake, for instance, then mostly to pump more money into the military. And make no mistake: With regard to foreign policy, Merz’s declaration of seeking “independence” from the US may sound intriguing. But he remains a rigid, intellectually provincial Atlanticist, mentally stuck in the 1990s, if not the (early) ‘80s. Merz’s idea of going it alone is motivated by nothing better than fear and necessity, as Washington under Donald Trump is getting ready to cut its European clients loose. Worse, where the imagination of, at least, a Gaullist would be required to rebuild European security with instead of against Russia, Merz seems to have no greater vision than, in effect, quixotically trying to make Germany (perhaps together with France as junior partner and nuke provider) replace America inside a shrunken, de facto EU-European-centered NATO remaining frozen in self-crippling Russophobia and daft Cold War reenacting, Kaja Kallas-style. Think of it as a new mutation of Atlanticism that doesn’t even feature an Atlantic anymore. That is, obviously, a sad dead end, militarily, economically, and politically. But trying may still do much damage, for instance by interfering with finding peace in and for Ukraine. Merz has repeatedly posed as a diehard zealot of the Ukraine War; and immediately after the elections, his CDU posted on X that “Ukraine must win the war.” An old German proclivity for endgame delusions seems to be asserting itself. Sorry, Ukrainians: The Americans and Russians may think enough blood has flowed; the Germans want more. And then there is Germany’s worst, deepest, moral failure: Siding with Israel and serving as a de facto accomplice in its many crimes, including genocide. There, Merz has literally rushed to show that he intends to be even worse than his predecessors: Defying the International Criminal Court that has issued an arrest warrant for Israel’s leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the chancellor-elect lost no time inviting the wanted war criminal to Berlin. So much for obeying the law in the country of law and order. Germany has had elections. But there definitely has not been a new beginning. It’s not even a false dawn. Dark night abides.

Title: Time To Turn Bullish On Ethereum? CryptoQuant CEO Spots Key Signals

Ethereum (ETH) has plummeted 11.4% in the past 24 hours, reflecting a broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop by 8%, XRP by 13.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 12.9%. Despite the sea of red, several leading voices—including CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju—are calling for a more optimistic perspective on ETH. Sharing his “bullish thoughts on ETH” via X, Ki Young Ju argued there has been “no significant sell pressure” despite the recent Bybit hack, pointing out that both on-chain and market data remain neutral. “Exchange selling takes time, and OTC offloads barely affect the price,” he added. He also emphasized Ethereum’s dominant share of the stablecoin market cap—currently around 56% and noted how potential regulatory shifts under the Trump administration, which is reportedly “easing crypto regs,” could spur further adoption of ETH-based stablecoins and smart contracts in 2025. Ju referenced additional catalysts, reminding followers that the ETH spot ETF “is already approved,” suggesting that a “Large Cap ETF altseason” might be on the horizon for Ethereum. He added, “BlackRock ETH spot ETF holdings increased 124% over the past three months.” Lastly, Ju highlighted growing whale accumulation: addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have increased their balances by 24% over the past year, with the current price “nearing the cost basis of accumulating addresses.” However, Ju admitted he was “surprised” by what he sees as an overwhelmingly bearish mood on Crypto Twitter. “Wow, CT [Crypto Twitter] sentiment on ETH is extremely bearish. Let me know if you have any data-driven analysis to support your bearish thesis. Most bears seem to cite the dropping price itself as their reason for selling. Very interesting,” Ju remarked. On his alternative X account—under the handle @kate_young_ju—he reiterated that “whales are stacking ETH,” pointing to the current cost basis for these accumulating addresses at around $2,199, compared to the spot price hovering near $2,505. Ju is not alone in challenging the doom-and-gloom market narrative. AdrianoFeria.eth (@AdrianoFeria), an member of the ETH community, asserted that “the market is in the shitter” but urged investors to focus on high-level institutional and political signals favoring Ethereum. He specifically cited reports of the US President and family purchasing “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH,” the CEO of BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization (and BlackRock’s own tokenized USD experiment on Ethereum), and Bybit’s need to buy large quantities of ETH to cover its hack—potentially fueling more demand. Feria also mentioned that Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel believes Ethereum could replace Bitcoin. For this community member, the fact that “everyone on CT is still taking a shit on ETH” only reinforces a contrarian bullish stance. Popular crypto analyst IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) weighed in by posting a chart showing another “red scary candle” but indicating a buy zone above $2,400. Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, offered historical perspective, reminding followers of 2021’s mid-cycle drawdowns: BTC fell 56%, ETH 61%, SOL 67%, and many other assets 70-80%. According to Burniske, “you can come up with all the reasons for why this cycle is different, but the mid-bull reset we’re going through isn’t unprecedented. Those calling for a full blown bear are misguided.” At press time, ETH traded at $2.382.

Title: 'A fifth of voters hate me': How do foreigners in Germany feel about far-right surge?

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Germans voted in a federal election on Sunday and the results are clear: The right-leaning Union parties (CDU/CSU) gained the biggest share of votes and are on course to lead the next government. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) grabbed the second biggest share of votes, showing that the anti-immigration party has become a significant political force. We asked our readers to share their thoughts on the election results in a snap survey. Nearly one-third of those who immediately responded said they were eligible to vote in the election – meaning they already held a German passport, or had recently naturalised. Two-thirds of respondents were ineligible to vote because they didn’t have German citizenship. Many foreign residents living in Germany are unable to vote for this reason. In fact there are more people living in Germany without a German passport than there were votes for AfD in the past election. [There are currently 12.9 million people living in Germany without citizenship, whereas the AfD got nearly 10.2 million first votes.] OPINION: In Germany's election, too many voices will yet again go unheard A post shared by Arne Semsrott (@arne.semsrott) Despite their inability to vote, foreign residents will still be affected by policies crafted by the incoming conservative-led government, and also by anti-immigrant sentiments which are fuelled by the AfD. Many of our readers expressed concerns about the shift to the right in German politics that these elections have highlighted, while others were hopeful that centre-right leadership may boost the German economy. READ ALSO: What kind of coalition government should Germany expect after election? Foreign residents upset to see Germany shift to the right Asked how they felt about the election results, many readers said they felt “worried”, “nervous” or even “terrified”. Some noted that they were not surprised. In general it appears that the victory of the conservatives (who made tightening immigration policies a big part of their campaign) and the gain in support for a far right anti-immigration party has left a bad taste in the mouths of many in the non-German population. READ ALSO: German word of the day - Rechtsruck Only a very few respondents expressed positive feelings about the result. But at least one reader found reason to celebrate Germany’s democratic tradition. “Extraordinary results!” wrote Bhavesh Uppal, a 33-year-old sales manager in Berlin, adding that the incoming Bundestag maintains a full-spectrum of political offers. “From Die Linke to AfD – there’s unity in diversity of opinions.” Serious concerns about the AfD’s popularity Top of mind for many respondents was the AfD’s surge in support, from just over 10 percent in 2021 to around 20 percent now. With local chapters of the party formally considered right-wing extremist, and with leaders who have criticised Holocaust remembrance, invoked Nazi slogans and promoted deporting foreigners, many legally established immigrants in Germany have clear reasons for rejecting the party. “I don't feel safe and frankly have no plans to travel anywhere near the East German states,” said David, alluding to the fact that the AfD won the majority of votes in nearly every constituency in the former East German states. READ ALSO: How different groups of Germans voted in the federal election Sabrina Mercer, a 68-year-old retired teacher living in Frankfurt said she was “horrified” about the AfD’s success and glad that they did not go much higher than 20 percent of the vote. “I feel if they had taken the lead now with what is happening in the world, in light of the new alliance between Trump and Putin, it would have been disastrous on many levels.” Nancy Landrum, a 63-year-old professor in Leipzig echoed these sentiments: “It's unsettling that the AfD had so much support. Germany is one place we thought we could escape extreme far-right ideologies. As an immigrant, I am worried.” For some readers, who feel targeted by the far right party, seeing them gain so much voter support felt deeply personal. “At least one fifth of the voters hate me and want me gone,” wrote Dmitry, a 36-year-old software engineer in Düsseldorf. IN NUMBERS: What happened in the German election? But most respondents had expected the vote to go this way, even if they noted concerns about the general trend toward right wing populism. I can feel the change in the last two years and the anti-immigrant sentiment is only growing due to AfD’s rhetoric,” said Juan, who lives in Munich. “I still hope for the best with a centre coalition." Erica, a 41-year-old freelance copywriter in Berlin, said she expected this result but had hoped the centre-left would have retained more votes. She added, “Elon Musk's endorsement of AfD exposed some of the party's internal contradictions: The so-called nationalist party of the economically disenfranchised directly aligns with an über-rich immigrant's views." Despite their hardline anti-immigration stance, the far right party does find some support among foreign residents. A handful of respondents to our survey indicated that they voted for, or would have voted for, the AfD – amounting to about 20 percent of those surveyed, which is roughly aligned with the proportion of AfD voters seen across the country. “I am disappointed that the AfD did not perform more strongly,” wrote Denizan, a 31-year-old engineer in Bremen. He suggested that the Union parties have “already betrayed their election mandate to deport more illegal immigrants…This is particularly concerning to me as a legal immigrant who did everything right to become naturalised and have worked hard my entire life.” 'I don't trust Merz' Despite their increased support, the AfD is still not in a position to govern in Germany. Leading the country’s next coalition government will be CDU leader Friedrich Merz. Asked how they felt about Merz becoming Germany’s next Chancellor, readers of The Local had mixed responses. Overall, the response to Merz could be described as less than positive. Many readers who disliked him said they didn’t trust him to follow through on campaign promises, or expected him to push Germany further to the right. “Big yikes,” said Elizabeth, a 31-year-old software engineer in Berlin. “I don't expect him to uphold norms or be a trustworthy coalition partner, and I think his strategy will be to try to make the SPD blink by threatening them with the AfD.” “This new, more right-wing CDU worries me,” said Carlos, a 38-year-old Cologne-based software developer. “As a European citizen, I don't exactly have direct fears about immigration policies, but I wouldn't like to see a Germany with closed borders.” Carlos added that he’d prefer to see the next government coalition take aim at structural problems such as heavy bureaucracy. READ ALSO: Netanyahu, Trump and the far right - What Merz said the day after German election Interestingly, Merz’ business credentials earned him both support and criticism, depending on readers’ views of his politics. Simon Slade, a retiree living in Frankfurt described Merz as “an old wealthy white man who worked for Blackrock and lacks both empathy and understanding of what is required.” In support of Merz, Leoni, a 54-year-old English teacher in Leipzig said, “I believe he can stabilise the struggling economy...” But Leoni added that if Merz works more with the far right, that could hurt the country’s ability to attract skilled workers. Another reader noted that his business-friendly politics could be popular with companies, but said they hope he doesn’t give up on Germany's climate promises.

Title: Enhancing anesthetic techniques for improving whisker stimulation response in the barrel cortex
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0318306
Time Published: 2025-02-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
This study adopts and validates an anesthetic protocol designed for rat whisker stimulation experiments, achieving significant enhancements in the neural response of the barrel field cortex. By combining alpha-chloralose, low-dose Isoflurane (0.5%) and Dexdomitor, the protocol not only maintains a stable anesthetic state but also markedly improves the amplitude and latency of local field potential (LFP) signals. Experimental results reveal that LFP amplitudes in the barrel field under this protocol are twice as high as those achieved with Isoflurane and four times as high as those with Ketamine-Xylazine, with significantly shortened latencies and reduced noise interference. For the first time, power spectral analysis reveals a distinct enhancement of oscillatory power in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, diverging from the traditional dominance of delta (0.5–4 Hz) oscillations observed with other anesthetics. Mechanistically, this phenomenon may be attributed to alpha-chloralose’s unique modulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways, promoting cortical desynchronization and enhanced sensory processing. This protocol offers new insights into optimizing sensory-evoked neural signal acquisition and provides a reference for future studies exploring neural modulation in sensory neuroscience.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing interests: There are no actual or apparent conflict of interest in this study for any of the co-authors. In neurophysiological research, the barrel cortex of rats serves as a core model for processing tactile information, playing a particularly significant role in whisker stimulation experiments [1,2]. The precise anatomical structure and functional characteristics of the barrel cortex make it an ideal platform for investigating tactile perception, sensorimotor integration, and cortical neural network dynamics [3,4]. However, obtaining high-quality local field potential (LFP) signals remains a major challenge due to muscle noise interference and physiological fluctuations induced by anesthesia [5,6]. These issues not only compromise the stability and reliability of experimental data but may also obscure deeper insights into the mechanisms of sensory neural activity. Therefore, developing optimized anesthetic protocols tailored for long-term neural recordings is crucial [7,8]. Commonly used anesthetics include Isoflurane [9,10] and Ketamine-Xylazine [11,12]. While these anesthetics meet the requirements of short-term experiments, their limitations in long-term neural recordings are apparent. Isoflurane requires continuous administration to maintain its anesthetic effect, but it often causes physiological fluctuations, such as a decrease in body temperature and unstable heart rate, which can significantly impact the stability of neural signals [13,14]. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine provides effective sedation but has a short duration of action (approximately 30 minutes), necessitating frequent re-dosing. This increases the complexity of experimental operations and often leads to significant physiological fluctuations, reducing the reliability of experimental results [15–17]. These limitations highlight the urgent need for a stable anesthetic protocol capable of minimizing interference during long-term experiments to meet the demand for high-quality data in sensory neuroscience research [18,19]. To address these issues, some studies have explored improved anesthetic protocols. For example, Yuan et al. found that alpha-chloralose could effectively enhance the quality of raw brain signals by comparing different anesthetic protocols [20]. While this approach has demonstrated significant advantages in reducing muscle noise interference and improving signal clarity, its suitability for long-term experiments, its effect on specific LFP frequency bands, and its regulatory mechanisms on neural signals still require further investigation [21]. Building on this, the present study proposes an anesthetic protocol designed for whisker stimulation experiments. By combining alpha-chloralose with low-dose Isoflurane (0.5%) and supplementing it with Dexdomitor to suppress muscle activity, this protocol significantly improves LFP signal clarity while effectively maintaining the core physiological stability of the animals [20]. Experiments show that, compared to traditional anesthetic protocols using Isoflurane or Ketamine-Xylazine alone, this combined protocol demonstrates superior stability and reliability over the course of 7-hour experiments [22]. Moreover, Dexdomitor exhibits unique advantages in reducing noise interference caused by muscle activity, providing additional support for the accuracy of data in long-term neural recording experiments [16]. In addition to validating the practical utility of the anesthetic protocol, this study systematically investigates the frequency-domain characteristics of LFP signals under different anesthetic protocols. Power spectral analysis reveals that alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances oscillatory power in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands, in stark contrast to the delta-band-dominated characteristics commonly observed with other anesthetics [23]. This phenomenon may be attributed to alpha-chloralose’s ability to regulate GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways, promoting cortical desynchronization and enhancing neural responses. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: The rest of this paper is organized as following: Section II states experimental setups. Section III introduces three different anesthetics methods and experimental system. The experiment results are present to validate our techniques’ superiority in Section IV. Section V concludes this paper. This section first introduces the source of animals used in our experiments. Then, we show the details of the preparing things for the experimental setups. The 30 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (31-12-002-D-000010), weighing 250–350 g, were purchased from the Institute of Medical Experimental Animals at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. They were housed under a strict 12-hour light-dark cycle in animal room accredited by the Animal Protection and Use Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University. All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the committee. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure ethical treatment, in alignment with ARRIVE guidelines (PLoS Biol 8(6): e1000412, 2010). In this study, we conducted comparative experiments on 3 groups (G1 = 10, G2 = 10, G3 = 10) to evaluate the effects of three anesthesia methods: alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine. On the experimental day, animals were randomly assigned to different anesthesia protocol groups to minimize potential biases. To accurately collect the electroencephalogram (EEG) response signals of rats’ whisker stimulation, we followed a series of preparatory steps as outlined in [24]. In this section, we first introduce three anesthetic methods (alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine) used in animal experiments. Then we present the details of whisker stimulation experimental system. Alpha-chloralose induces a sedative state by enhancing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity in rodents. Typically administered via intravenous or intraperitoneal injection for anesthesia in rats and mice, it effectively maintains the animals in a sedated or unconscious state, thereby minimizing discomfort and stress responses triggered by external stimuli. In this study, the time interval from Isoflurane induction to the administration of alpha-chloralose was approximately 25 minutes (4 minutes for induction, 15-20 minutes for surgical procedures and electrode placement, and 2-3 minutes for physiological observation). Subsequently, alpha-chloralose was administered to the rats via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg (i.p.). Finally, LFP signals were recorded. Isoflurane is typically administered via inhalation, with its primary mechanism being the enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity in the central nervous system and the inhibition of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, thereby achieving an anesthetic effect. Due to its rapid onset and favorable recovery profile, Isoflurane is widely used in animal experiments. In this experiment, to prevent SD rats from unexpectedly waking during stimulation, Isoflurane should be maintained at an anesthesia level of 1.5% to collect LFP signals from the barrel cortex following whisker stimulation. The Ketamine-Xylazine is known for its rapid onset and short duration of anesthesia, making it an ideal choice for procedures requiring quick recovery. It is widely used in minor surgeries and diagnostic imaging to enhance anesthetic and sedative effects. Generally speaking, the anesthetic effect of Ketamine-Xylazine in rats lasts for only 30 minutes. Similarly, the time interval from Isoflurane induction to Ketamine-Xylazine administration was also approximately 25 minutes. Then, the rats were administered Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Finally, we recorded the LFP signals. Rats’ whiskers are sensitive detectors for tactile information, allowing them to navigate, recognize, and perceive their surroundings. As shown in Fig 1a, each whisker corresponds to a specialized barrel structure in the somatosensory cortex of the rat brain [1]. To capture specific neural signals triggered by whisker stimulation, this study applied mechanical stimulation to a single whisker. Fig 1b shows that an L-shaped tube is connected to the shaft of a stepper motor, and the target whisker (C2 of the large barrel column) is inserted into the tube. The Arduino UNO R3 controller and A4988 stepper motor driver together drive the motor shaft rotation, while a pulse generator (Master 8, A.M.P.I.) provides trigger signal. The Cerbus device is connected to recording electrodes to collect real-time LFP signals following whisker stimulation.

[25] and Tsytsarev et al. [26], in this study, the whisker was deflected counterclockwise from the head to the tail at a speed of 200 mm/s and then returned to its original position. Each deflection had an amplitude of 0.2 mm and employed a “ramp-and-hold” stimulus mode with a rise/fall time of 1 ms, maintaining a total deflection duration of 3 ms per stimulus. The interval between each stimulus was 1.5 seconds, and the entire experiment was repeated 200 times to ensure the reliability of cortical responses. This section first present the barrel cortex LFP signals under different anesthetics protocols by whisker stimulation. Then we conduct a comparative analysis, emphasizing the robustness of the signals collected through our protocol. Finally, we demonstrate that our protocol results in minimal alterations in physiological parameters, highlighting its efficacy and safety. The 30 animals were randomly assigned to three groups, with each group receiving one of the anesthetic protocols to ensure equal representation in the sample. We used AgCl extracellular electrode to record the animals’ brain EEG under alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-xylazine anesthetic protocols before whisker stimulation. When using a low concentration of Isoflurane (0.5%) or alpha-chloralose alone for anesthesia, animals typically wake within half an hour, displaying responses such as toe or ear twitches. Fig 2 showed stable EEG signals obtained under three anesthesia protocols. It can be seen that with alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane, the EEG signals remain stable but include some muscle noise; with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, the EEG signal improves significantly. Using 1.5% Isoflurane alone eliminates muscle noise in the EEG. Although Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia has a stronger effect than 1.5% Isoflurane, it still introduces some muscle noise. These findings indicate that the combination of alpha-chloralose and 0.5% Isoflurane is an optimal approach for acquiring high-quality EEG signals from the animal brain. Accordingly, we employed this combination to record barrel cortex LFP signals in response to whisker stimulation. We stimulated the C2 whisker to find the precise C2 barrel column location. As shown in Fig 3, we can clear see that the C2 barrel column is located at 2.5 mm posterior and 5.5 mm lateral to bregma, within the left hemisphere. Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in black; Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.5% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in red; 1.5% Isoflurane is represented in green; and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia is represented in blue. Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in black; Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.5% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in red; 1.5% Isoflurane is represented in green; and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia is represented in blue. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318306.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318306.g003 We also analyzed the barrel cortex LFP signals and their corresponding Power Spectral Density (PSD) under whisker stimulation across different anesthetic protocols. As illustrated in Fig 4a, significant differences in the barrel cortex LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies induced by whisker stimulation were observed under different anesthetic protocols. The peak amplitude under alpha-chloralose anesthesia (~800 µV) was approximately twice that under Isoflurane (~400 µV) and four times that under Ketamine-Xylazine (~200 µV). Furthermore, the peak latency of the LFP response under alpha-chloralose anesthesia was notably shorter (~17 ms) compared to Isoflurane (~18 ms) and Ketamine-Xylazine (~20 ms). These differences in both amplitude and latency likely reflect the distinct effects of each anesthetic protocol on cortical desynchronization, neural responsiveness, and signal transmission efficiency. Alpha-chloralose, by preserving excitability and minimizing inhibition, significantly enhances neural responsiveness and reduces latency, making it superior for capturing sensory-evoked LFP signals. In contrast, the stronger cortical suppression associated with Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine not only results in lower LFP amplitudes but also prolongs peak latencies, indicating slower cortical response times. Fig 4b provides a detailed comparison of the PSD of LFP signal responses induced by whisker stimulation under three different anesthetic conditions. Compared to Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia, alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances the power of LFP signals in the low-frequency (alpha band, 8–13 Hz) and mid-frequency (beta band, 13–30 Hz) ranges. Notably, while delta band activity (0.5–4 Hz) typically dominates under deep anesthesia, it is markedly suppressed under alpha-chloralose anesthesia. This suppression may also be attributed to cortical desynchronization induced by whisker stimulation and the unique pharmacological properties of alpha-chloralose, which maintain neural responsiveness and amplify oscillatory activities in the alpha and beta bands. These findings not only highlight the superior ability of alpha-chloralose anesthesia to enhance the intensity and frequency response of neural signals induced by whisker stimulation but also reveal differences in the modulation of delta, alpha, and beta band activities across different anesthetic protocols. This modulation is of critical importance for optimizing neural signal acquisition in in vivo brain stimulation experiments and provides valuable insights for both research and clinical applications. (a) Barrel cortex LFP signals recorded during whisker stimulation under three anesthetic conditions: alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane (red), 1.5% Isoflurane (green), and Ketamine-Xylazine (blue). The time axis represents the duration of whisker stimulation in milliseconds, and the voltage axis represents the LFP signal amplitude in microvolts (µV). The peak LFP amplitude is highest with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, followed by 1.5% Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine. (b) Power spectral density (PSD) analysis of LFP signals across different anesthetic protocols. The alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands are highlighted with shaded regions (pink for alpha, blue for beta). The PSD comparison shows that alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane significantly amplifies power in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, while 1.5% Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine show reduced power in these bands.

The experiment indicates that alpha-chloralose anesthesia reaches its deepest state at 2 hours, followed by a gradual recovery of neural activity and an enhanced response to whisker stimulation. Under whisker stimulation, we monitored the amplitude and peak latency of LFP signals in the barrel cortex to evaluate the effects of different anesthesia protocols. This evaluation method is similar to the one used in previous studies [27]. Fig 5 presents the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies under three anesthesia protocols. Compared to Isoflurane or Ketamine-Xylazine, alpha-chloralose anesthesia protocol has a greater LFP signal strength and a shorter latency period. Initially, the LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies were 790 ± 13 uV and 17 ± 1.3 ms for alpha-chloralose, 388 ± 11 uV and 18 ± 1.1 ms for Isoflurane, and 201 ± 14 uV and 21 ± 1.4 ms for Ketamine-Xylazine. Then 800 ± 10 uV and 16.9 ± 1.0 ms, 400 ± 12 uV and 17.9 ± 1.2 ms, 202 ± 17 uV and 22 ± 1.7 ms after 0.5 hours, respectively. After 7 hours, they became to 820 ± 16 uV and 17 ± 1.6 ms, and 311 ± 17 uV and 21 ± 1.7 ms. Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed that the differences in LFP signal strength among the anesthesia protocols were statistically significant (*p < 0.05). Moreover, independent samples t-tests revealed a significant difference in peak latency between the alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane and 1.5% Isoflurane protocols (*p < 0.05), indicating that the combination of alpha-chloralose and low-dose Isoflurane results in faster neural responses compared to higher concentrations of Isoflurane. In conclusion, the alpha-chloralose anesthesia protocol not only supports prolonged LFP signal recording in the barrel cortex but also significantly enhances the reliability of the data by maintaining high signal strength and reducing latency over time. This makes it a superior choice for long-term neural recordings compared to other commonly used anesthesia protocols such as Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine.

The anesthetic effect of Ketamine-Xylazine lasts only 0.5 hours, and its potential lethal risk precludes repeated use on the same animal. Therefore, we recorded the physiological parameters for Ketamine-Xylazine over 0.5 hours, and for alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane over 7 hours. (a) Mean and SEM of heart rate changes over 7 hours for animals anesthetized with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, 1.5% Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine.

After 7 hours, the heart rates in the alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane groups further dropped to 280 ± 3.2 bpm and 261 ± 3.5 bpm, respectively. The results of one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that the difference in heart rate between alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane was statistically significant (*p < 0.05), indicating that these two anesthetic protocols had significantly different effects on heart rate control. An independent samples t-test further confirmed this difference (*p < 0.05), with the alpha-chloralose group showing a relatively stable decrease in heart rate, while the Isoflurane group exhibited a greater drop in heart rate. These findings suggest that alpha-chloralose can induce a relatively stable decrease in heart rate, making it particularly suitable for experiments involving long-term data collection. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine led to a rapid and pronounced decrease in heart rate, limiting its applicability for long-term observations. Fig 6b present a typical temperature fluctuations among all experimental conditions. Initially, the baseline body temperature were 33.1 ± 1.3 °C for alpha-chloralose, 32.6 ± 1.8 °C for Isoflurane, and 32.2 ± 2.0 °C for Ketamine-Xylazine. Then decreased to 32.6 ± 2.0 °C, 32.1 ± 1.8 °C, and 31 ± 1.6 °C after 0.5 hours, respectively. After 7 hours, they became to 29.6 ± 1.2 °C, and 28.8 ± 2.2 °C. The results of a one-way ANOVA analysis indicated that the difference in body temperature fluctuations between alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane was statistically significant (*p < 0.05), suggesting that these two anesthetic protocols had significantly different effects on body temperature stability. An independent samples t-test further confirmed this difference (*p < 0.05), with the alpha-chloralose group showing a relatively stable decrease in body temperature over time, while the Isoflurane group exhibited a more pronounced drop in temperature. This suggests that alpha-chloralose can maintain a relatively stable decrease in body temperature, making it particularly suitable for long-term neural recording experiments where temperature stability is crucial. Stable temperature control is essential for accurate measurement of nervous system function, as excessively low or high body temperatures may alter neural signal conduction speed and neuronal activity, thereby affecting the reliability of LFP data. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine causes a rapid drop in body temperature, increasing the risk of data fluctuations and limiting its applicability for prolonged stable observations. The significant differences in the peak amplitudes and latencies of the barrel cortex LFP signals and heart rate and body temperature changes observed under different anesthetic protocols can be attributed to the distinct pharmacological properties of the anesthetics and their effects on neural excitability and cortical dynamics. The barrel cortex LFP signals and their corresponding PSD under whisker stimulation underscore the importance of choosing appropriate anesthetic protocols to optimize neural signal acquisition in sensory-evoked studies. Alpha-chloralose’s ability to preserve neural excitability and enhance cortical responses makes it a superior choice for experiments requiring precise and stable LFP recordings. Meanwhile, the observed dominance of alpha and beta bands in the power spectrum, rather than typical delta oscillations under anesthesia, can be attributed to the experimental paradigm and the choice of anesthetic agent. Whisker stimulation enhances cortical oscillations in the alpha and beta bands, associated with sensory processing and sensorimotor integration [33,36]. Alpha-chloralose anesthesia preserves cortical responsiveness, amplifying alpha and beta activities while suppressing delta oscillations typical of deep anesthesia [30,37]. These results provide valuable insights for future studies aiming to refine anesthetic techniques for in vivo neural signal acquisition. In the course of anesthesia, the gradual decrease in body temperature and heart rate over time can primarily be attributed to the effects of anesthetics, such as Isoflurane and alpha-chloralose, which act as central nervous system depressants inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity [38]. Isoflurane, in particular, induces rapid vasodilation, leading to significant heat loss and a rapid drop in body temperature [39]. In contrast, alpha-chloralose demonstrates a more gradual and stable decline in body temperature and heart rate, potentially due to its milder impact on the hypothalamic thermoregulation center [40]. Furthermore, alpha-chloralose offers a longer duration of anesthetic effects (up to 7 hours) compared to Ketamine-Xylazine, which lasts only about 30 minutes, making it more suitable for prolonged experiments [41]. In our study, while both heart rate and body temperature decreased under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, the rate of change was more stable than with Isoflurane, allowing for better maintenance of physiological stability during long-term neural recordings. This study proposes an anesthesia protocol combining Isoflurane, Dexdomitor, and alpha-chloralose to optimize the quality of barrel cortex LFP signals elicited by whisker stimulation. It systematically compares different anesthesia protocols in terms of signal characteristics, physiological stability, and neural response latency. The novelty of this study is highlighted in three key aspects: 1) In-depth Exploration of the Anesthesia Protocol and Signal Enhancement Mechanism: The experimental results demonstrate that alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances the amplitude of barrel cortex LFP signals (approximately twice that of Isoflurane and four times that of Ketamine-Xylazine) and shortens peak latency. Compared to conventional anesthesia methods, these advantages are attributed to the desynchronization and balancing mechanisms facilitated by alpha-chloralose through the modulation of GABA and glutamate pathways. This mechanism not only improves cortical responsiveness to whisker stimulation but also avoids the excessive suppression of neuronal excitability seen with Isoflurane and the physiological fluctuations induced by Ketamine-Xylazine. 2) Explanation of the Mechanisms Underlying Anesthesia-Induced Differences: The differences in LFP signal characteristics across anesthesia protocols can be attributed to their distinct pharmacological actions: Isoflurane induces deep neuronal inhibition by activating GABA_A receptors and inhibiting NMDA receptors, leading to reduced LFP signal amplitude and delayed responses. Ketamine-Xylazine causes significant physiological fluctuations (e.g., heart rate and body temperature decreases) due to NMDA receptor blockade and α2-adrenergic agonist effects, which increase signal variability. Alpha-chloralose maintains a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural networks, enabling the cortex to respond to whisker stimulation rapidly and efficiently while reducing delta-band synchronized slow-wave activity. Furthermore, alpha-chloralose’s mild central nervous system suppression makes it suitable for long-term stable recordings. 3) Practical Methodological Value: The study validates the reliability and advantages of alpha-chloralose anesthesia for long-term neural recordings, evidenced by sustained high signal strength (over 800 µ V for 7 hours) and relatively stable heart rate and body temperature. In contrast, Isoflurane caused more pronounced physiological parameter fluctuations, while Ketamine-Xylazine’s rapid induction of heart rate and body temperature drops limited its applicability for prolonged experiments. These findings provide technical guidance for optimizing neural signal acquisition, particularly in sensory neuroscience research that demands high sensitivity and minimal interference. Through a detailed exploration of anesthesia mechanisms and signal differences, this study lays a solid foundation for further advancements in the field of sensory neuroscience.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have an extra, extra special guest. Charlie Ellis is just a legend in the world of investing. He started for the Rockefeller Family Office before going to DLJ and eventually ended up launching Greenwich Associates. He’s published 21 books. He’s won every award you can win in the World, world of Finance. He was a member of Vanguard’s board of director. He was chairman of the Yale’s Endowment Investment Committee and his, not only did he write 21 books, his new book, rethinking Investing, is just a delightful snack. It’s only a hundred pages and it distills 60 years of investing women wisdom into a very, very short read. I found the book excellent. And Charlie, as delightful as always, I really enjoyed our conversation and I think you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with Charlie Alice. Charley Ellis: Thank you, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thank you for being here. First of all, we’re gonna talk a lot about the book in a bit, which I really just devoured over a cup of tea. It was that short and very delightful. But before we do that, I want people to fully understand what a fascinating background you’ve had and how really interesting your career is. Where you began and where you ended up. You get a master’s in business from Harvard Business School, a PhD from New York University, and then you sort of happened onto Rockefeller Foundation. How did you get that first job? How did you discover your calling? Charley Ellis: A friend of mine at business school said, or have you got a job yet? I said, no, not yet. Got a couple of things that I’m working towards. He said, well, I’ve got a friend, and I thought he meant the Rockefeller Foundation actually. He meant the Rockefeller family in their investment office. And very, very bright guy. Came up from New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts, climbed to the third floor of my apartment building, and we did an interview in what I would have to describe as shabby graduate student facility. And at the end of half an hour, I realized it isn’t the foundation that he’s talking about. He’s talking about something else. And I gotta figure out what that is. At the end of the second half an hour, I knew he was talking about investing where there were no courses at that time, at the Harvard Business School on Investment Management. And he’s really describing the Rockefeller Family Office Barry Ritholtz: Yes. Not necessarily the foundation. So what were they doing at that time? What were their investments like? Charley Ellis: Well, they invested the family’s fortune. And at that time, relative to other family fortunes, it was the large major, so on and so on. They were also, because they’d been generous philanthropically for years, managing several charitable organizations, endowments. So the combination made us a consequential investment client for Wall Street as Wall Street was just coming into doing serious research on individual companies and industries. So it was take off time for what became institutional investing. Barry Ritholtz: So give us some context as to that era. This is the 1970s and eighties, essentially when, when that Charley Ellis: Was in 1960s, Barry Ritholtz: So late sixties, not a lot of data available on a regular basis. And modern portfolio theory was kind of just coming around. Is That right? 00:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it was just a, an academic curiosity. Nobody’s right mind thought it had a chance of being proven. But you know, if you go back to those days, if we came back to it, we would all of us agree with the people who said, no, it’s nothing. It’s not gonna happen. The transformation of the whole investment management world, information availability, legislation, who’s participating? What’s the trading volume? What kind of information is available? How fast can you get it? Wow. Every one of those dimensions has changed and changed and changed. The world is completely different today. Barry Ritholtz: You detail that in the book. We’ll talk about that in a little bit. That if you just go back 50 years, completely different world, as you mentioned, the volume, but who the players are, how technology allows us to do things that we couldn’t do before. And that we’ve also learned a lot since then. Charley Ellis: We sure have, you know, it’s hard to remember, but I do because I was new and fresh. And so it made an impression. Trading volume was 3 million shares in New York. Stock Exchange listed. Now it’s six, seven, 8 billion. That’s a huge change. Order of magnitude. The amount of research that was available was virtually zero. Barry Ritholtz: Now, I recall. Well, the CCH binders used to get updates on a regular basis, the clearinghouse binders, and then it was essentially Zachs and a whole bunch of different companies. But that’s really late eighties, right? Like when did the research explosion really happen? Charley Ellis: The research explosion happened in the seventies and then into the eighties, but the documents that you were looking at or thinking about, were all looking backwards, Give you the plain vanilla facts of what’s happened in the last five years in a standardized format with no analytical or insight available. Now everything about research is a future, and it’s full of factual information and careful interpretation. It’s really different. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really interesting. So how long were you at Rockefeller before you launched Greenwich Associates in 1972? Charley Ellis: Well, I was there for two and a half years. Then I went to Wall Street with Donaldson Lufkin and Jennrette for six, and then I started Greenwich Associates. Barry Ritholtz: So what led you after less than a decade to say, I’m gonna hang my own shingle? It seems kind of bold at that point. You’re barely 30 years old. Charley Ellis: It was a little nervy. I have to graduate. There are a couple of different parts. One is that I knew from my own personal experience, I had no ability to get my clients to tell me what I was doing right or wrong. They’d always say, oh, you’re doing fine. Just keep it up. You’re doing fine. And then I have no idea what my competition was doing. You know, if we could give factual information on exactly how well each firm is doing and how every one of their competitors are doing, we could interpret that in ways that clients would find really useful. And then we could advise them on specific recommendations based on the facts. Really undeniable facts based on 300, 500, 600 interviews with people who made the decisions and it worked Barry Ritholtz: Well I can’t imagine they’re happy with the outcome because what you eventually end up learning is that a lot of people who charge high fees for supposedly expert stock picking, expert market timing expert allocation, they’re not doing so well. And it turns out, at least on the academic side, it appears that the overall market is beating them. Charley Ellis: I wouldn’t quite say it that way, So I wouldn’t deny what you’re saying, but I would’ve say it differently when the purpose of any market, a grocery store, drug store, filling station, the purpose of any market is really to find what’s the right price that people will buy and trade at. And the securities industry is a very strong illustration of that. Lots of buyers, lots of sellers, what do they think is the right price to do a transaction? And they put real money behind it. So that purpose of a market gets better and better and better when the participants are more skillful, when the participants have more information, when the information is really accessible. And that’s what’s happened to the securities markets. The ability to get information from a Bloomberg terminal, if you don’t mind using Mike’s name. Sure. But seriously, Bloomberg Terminal will spew out so much in the way of factual information. And there are hundreds of thousands of these terminals all over the world, huh? So everybody in his right mind has ’em and uses them. Everybody’s right. Mind has computing power that would knock the socks off. Anybody who came from 1970 got dropped into the current period, that would just be amazed at the computing power. And they don’t use slide rules anymore. You know, back in the early seventies, everybody used a slide rule. Wow. And we were proud of ’em, and we were pretty skilled at it. But it’s nothing like having computing power behind you In those days. There were very few in the way of federal regulations. Now it’s against the law for a company to have a private luncheon with someone who’s in the investment world. Barry Ritholtz: Right. Reg FD said it has to be disclosed to everybody at once. So it is, you can’t just whisper it… 00:09:45 [Speaker Changed] And everybody gets the same information at the same time. So basically what you’ve got is everybody in the game is competing with everybody knowing everything that everybody else knows at exactly this very same time. And you can be terribly creative and wonderfully bright and very original, but if everybody knows exactly what you know, then they’ve got computing power. So they can do all kinds of analytics. Then they’ve got Bloomberg terminal, so they can do any backgrounding that they wanna find. It’s really hard to see how you’re gonna be able to beat them by much, if anything. And the truth is that people who are actively investing are usually making, they don’t mean to, but they are making mistakes. And those mistakes put them a little bit behind, a little bit behind, a little bit behind the market. And then of course, they charge fees that are high enough. So trying to recover those fees while trading, and you can only trade successfully by beating the other guy when he’s just as good as you are. He’s got just as big a computer as you have. He’s got just the same factual information you have. Then all those other different dimensions. There’s no way that you could think, oh yeah, this is a good opportunity to do. Well, that’s why people increasingly it, in my view, sensibly turned index funds to cut down on the cost. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So it’s interesting how well you express that because sometime in the 1970s you start writing your thoughts down and publishing them. Not long after, in 1977 you win a gram and dot award. Tell us what you were writing about back in the 1970s and what were you using for a data series when there really wasn’t a lot of data? 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] Well, the data did come, but it came later. And fortunately it proved out to be very strong confirmation for what I’ve been thinking. But I was in institutional sales and I would go around from one investor to another, to another, to another, to another. And I knew pretty quickly. They’re all really bright guys. They’re all very competitive, they’re all very well informed. They’re all very serious students trying to get better and better and better. Their job is to beat the other guys. But the other guys are getting better and better and better all the time. Striving to be best informed. They get up early, they study on through the night. They take work home on weekends. Competition, competition, competition, competition. How are you going to do better than those other guys when there’s so much in the way of raw input is the same? And the answer is no. You can’t. Barry Ritholtz: Michael Maubboisson calls that the paradox of skill, as all the players in a specific area get more and more skillful. Outcomes tend to be determined more by random luck because everybody playing is so good at the game. 00:12:41 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely true. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m fascinated by this quote. We’ve been talking about errors and making mistakes. One of the things from your book that really resonated is quote, we are surrounded by temptations to be wrong in both investing and in life. Explain, 00:13:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, we all know about life. They were tempted by beautiful men, beautiful women we’re tempted by whiskey, gin, or other drinks where some of us get tempted by drugs and other things like that. So there are lots of temptations out and around that you think about. All of us in the investment world are striving to be rational, which is a terribly difficult thing to do. Warren Buffett is rational and is brilliantly rational. He also does an enormous amount of homework. He also has terrific ability to remember things that he studied and he spends most of his time reading, studying, memorizing and reusing. Very few people have that kind of ability, natural ability that he has. But most of us now have equipment that’ll damn near do the same thing. And you could call up things from the historical record anytime you want to. It puts everybody in a position of being able to compete more and more skillfully all the time. 00:14:10 And therefore, candidly, I think it’s the fees are a big problem. And then the second problem is, yes, we’ve got opportunities to be more and more skillful and more and more effective. But actually what we also have, which really drives anybody who’s serious about examining the data, drives ’em nuts than anybody who is an investor wants to deny it. And that is that we make mistakes. We get scared by the market after it’s gone down. We get excited about the market positively after it’s gone up. And we interpret and make mistakes in our judgment. Now, this wonderful section in this little bitty book that I’ve just finished, wonderful section on behavioral economics, terrific book by Daniel Kahneman, thinking Fast, thinking Slow. That’s several hundred pages. And anybody in the investment world ought to read it because it tells you all about what we need to know about ourselves. 00:15:06 And I’ve got one chapter that just ticks off a whole bunch of things. Like 80% of people think they’re above average dancers. 80% of people think they’re above average drivers. If you ask men a question on are you really above average at various kinds of skills, they get up to pretty 90%, 95% saying they’re very, very, very good. Now, if you look at a college group, are you gonna have happier life than your classmates? Yes, by far. Are you gonna get divorced as much as your classmates? Oh no, that won’t happen to me. Then all kinds of other things that anybody looking at it objectively would say, you know, Barry, that just isn’t the way it’s gonna happen. These guys aren’t that much better drivers than the normal crowd. In fact, they are part of the normal crowd. 00:15:58 [Speaker Changed] You know, we, we all imagine that we’re separate from the crowd. I love the expression, I’m stuck in traffic when the reality is if you are near a major urban center during rush hour on Workday, you’re not stuck in traffic. You are traffic. And we all tend to think of ourselves as separate. Really, really fascinating stuff. I’m fascinated by the evolution of your investing philosophy. You start with Rockefeller Family Office, I assume back in the 1960s that was a fairly active form of investing. Tell us a little bit about how you began, what sort of strategies were you were using and then how you evolved. 00:16:40 [Speaker Changed] Woo. Boy, that’s a complicated question. First of all, in the early sixties when I was working for the Rockefeller family, that was the old world. All kinds of changes have taken place since then and virtually turned every single dimension of what was the right description of the investment world into a very different opposite version. And it change like that makes it almost a waste of time to talk about what was it like. But just for instance, I did some analysis of a company called DuPont Sure. Which was one of the blue chip blue chips of all time. And I had also been studying IBM, which was a wonderful company. And I realized, you know, IBM has got an ability to generate its own growth because it is creating one after another, advancement in computing power. And they’ve got a terrific organization behind it, and they are able to create their own growth. 00:17:43 IBM is a true growth company. DuPont needs to invent something that other people would really want, and it has to be something that’s really new. And then they get patent protection for a certain period of time, and then they lose the patent protection because it’s completed. They’ve got a different situation. Both companies were selling at 30, 32 times earnings. One company I thought was sure to continue growing and the other I wasn’t so sure. So I got permission to go down to Wilmington, Delaware, and for three days I had nothing but one interview after another, after another, after another. Were the senior executive of the DuPont organization. And they were very candid. And they told me about their problems. They told me about their opportunities. They told me about their financial policies. Their first level financial policies were that they would always pay out half their earnings and dividends long established. 00:18:43 And that was the way they did things. And the second thing is, they had a major commitment to nylon, but nylon was no longer patent protected. And so the profit margins of nylon were gonna come down for sure and come down rather rapidly because competition was building up pretty quickly. They hoped to build one terrific business in a leather substitute called Core Fam. But as I talked to the executives, they kept talking to me about, we’re having difficulty getting people to use Core Fam. We’re getting people who make shoes to think about using Core Fam. You know, we can’t get sales outside the United States to really get going. And we’re having a difficult time getting sales inside the United States. And candidly, it doesn’t look like this is gonna turn out to be the bonanza we had all thought it was going to be just a year or so ago. 00:19:35 Well, it doesn’t take a genius and it doesn’t take a very experienced person. And I was not a genius and I was not an experienced person, but I could see the handwriting. Wait a minute, if you only reinvest half your earnings each year and your major business is going to be more and more commoditized and your major new business is not taking off, you got a real problem here and you’re gonna have a tough time keeping up the kind of growth that would justify selling for 30 plus times earnings. Whereas IBM was guaranteed to be virtually guaranteed to be able to do that. ’cause they didn’t have very much the way of competition and they really knew what they were doing and they kept cranking it up. So what do you do? I came back and said, I know that the family, the Rockefeller family has many friends in the DuPont organization, but they also have many friends in the Watson family of IBM. I think it would be a great thing if we would sell off the holdings in DuPont and use the money to buy into IBM go out of one family friends into another, family friends. They would all understand it. And that was what was done. And of course it involved a substantial amount of ownership being shifted. And I’ve always thought to myself, wow. In that one specific recommendation, I earned my keep for several years. 00:21:03 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And and it’s fascinating ’cause that’s what was being done in every institutional investor and every endowment. People were making active choices, 00:21:15 [Speaker Changed] But they also were making lots of mistakes. Right. If you looked at what happened in the two years after my recommendation, IBM doubled and DuPont almost got cut in half. 00:21:26 [Speaker Changed] Wow. So that worked out really well. So it’s kind of fascinating that you’ve evolved into really thinking about indexing. ’cause when you’re, you were chairman of the Yale Endowment Investment Committee, David Swenson was famously the creator of the Yale model, and he had a lot of focus on private investment, on alternatives, on venture capital, hedge funds, as well as commodities. What made that era so different where those investments were so attractive then and apparently less attractive to you today? 00:22:02 [Speaker Changed] First you have to understand that David Swenson was a remarkably talented guy. He was the best PhD student at Jim Tobin Nobel Prize winner ever had. He was the first person to do an interest rate swap, which is the first derivative transaction that took place in this country between IBM and the World Bank. Which just to show you, everybody had told him, you’ll never be able to do that, David. So we’re talking about a very unusual guy. 00:22:33 And he was creative and disciplined in a remarkable combination. And he was the first person of size to get involved in a series of different types of investing. And then he very carefully chose the very best people in each of those different types. One day I was thinking, you know, he’s really done some very creative work. I wonder what’s his average length of relationship. Because the average length of relationship with most institutions was somewhere between two and a half and three and a half years. High turnover of managers, the calculation, it was 14 years on average and they were still running. So it’d probably be something like 20 years of typical relationship or duration, many of these managers when they were just getting started. So it’s the most dicey period in any investment organization. Very, very unusual and creative guy said to me after he’d been doing this for quite a long time, you know, the nature of creativity payoff is getting less and less and less because of everybody else’s doing what I’ve been doing. It’s not as rewarding as it used to be. And because I’ve been choosing managers and other people are trying to get into those same managers, they’re not as differentiated as they used to be. The rate of return magnitude that I’ve been able to accomplish 10 years ago, 15 years ago, I’m not gonna be able to do in 10 or 15 years into the future. And I think he was right. 00:24:10 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So how do you end up from going from the Yale Endowment to the Vanguard Board of Directors? Tell us where where that relationship came 00:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Completely different. Each one was doing what they were capable of doing really well. And Vanguard was focused on minimizing cost. And they really systematic at it different orientation. The orientation of the Yale endowment was to find managers and investment opportunities that were so different that you might get a higher rate of return. So attacking to reaching for higher and higher rate of return. Vanguard was reaching for lower and lower cost of executing a plain vanilla proposition. Index funds. Kanes once had somebody say, you’ve, you seem to have changed your mind. He said, yes, I, when the facts change, I do change my judgment. What do you do when the facts change? And the reality is we’ve been looking at a market that has changed and changed and changed and changed and the right way to deal with that market has therefore changed and changed and changed and changed then what you could have done in the early 1960s, you can’t do today. And what you should have done in the early sixties was go find an active manager who could knock the socks off at the competition. But it just, the competition is so damn good today that there isn’t a manager that can knock the socks off. 00:25:41 [Speaker Changed] And a quote from your book is, the grim reality is clear active investing is not able to keep up with, let alone outperform the market index. That’s the biggest change of the past 50 years, is that it’s become pretty obvious that the deck is used to be in favor of active managers. Now it seems to be very much stacked against them 00:26:06 [Speaker Changed] Because they’re so very good. It’s ironic, ironic, ironic. 00:26:10 [Speaker Changed] The paradox of skill. Yep. Huh. Really, really fascinating. You, you referenced some really interesting research in the book. One of the things I find fascinating is that research from Morningstar and DALBAR show that not only do investors tend to underperform the market, they underperform their own investments. Tell us about that. 00:26:36 [Speaker Changed] Because we’re human beings, as any behavioral economist would point out to you, we have certain beliefs and those beliefs tend to be very, very optimistic about our skills. And we think we can help ourself get better results, or at least to minimize the negative experiences. And the reality is that over time just doesn’t work out to be true. The average investor in an average year loses two full percent by making mistakes with the best of intentions, trying to do something really good for themselves. They make mistakes that are costly and that cost. Think about it, if you think the market’s gonna return something like six or 7%, you lose 2%, maybe two and a half, maybe three for inflation, call it two point a half. Whoop. That’s something down. Then you’ve got fees and costs. Gee was you add onto that if you did add on another 2% that you’ve made mistakes, you’re talking about a major transformation to the negative of what could have been your rate of return. 00:27:54 [Speaker Changed] Let’s put some, some numbers, some mean on that bone. You cite a uc Davis study that looked at 66,000 investor accounts from 1991 to 1996 over the that period, the market gained just under 18% a year, 17.9% a year. Investors had underperformed by 6.5% a year. They gave up a third of gains through mistakes, taxes, and costs. And then DALBAR does the same thing. And that’s where the two to 3% in a low return environment is. So how should investors think about this tendency to do worse than what the market does? 00:28:37 [Speaker Changed] Well in, in my view, and it’s part of the rethinking investing concept of the book, is if you find a problem that’s a repetitive problem, and this sure is attack the problem and try to reduce it. So what could you do to reduce the cost of behavioral economics? And the answer is index or ETF. And the reason why it would index or ETF would help is because it’s boring. Right? You know, if you own an index fund, you don’t get excited about what happened in the market as anything like you would get excited about if you had just had five stocks or if you had two or three mutual funds and you were tracking those mutual funds because they changed more. The market as a whole, it kind of goes along in its own lumbering way. A slow wide river of flow over time. And you, yeah, there’s nothing to get excited about. 00:29:40 So you leave it alone. Huh? You leave it alone and you leave it alone. And it’s a little bit like when your mother said, don’t pick it, that scab let it heal by itself. Well, but mom, it itches. You’d just be a little bit tolerant and don’t itch it or don’t scratch it and it’ll heal faster. And sure enough, mother was right In the same way, if you index, you won’t be excited by the same things that other people get excited by. Then you’ll just sort of steadily flow through and have all the good results come your way. That’s it. 00:30:14 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So first of all, I have to tell you, I, I love this book. It’s totally digestible. It’s barely a hundred pages. I literally read it over a cup of tea and, and you’ve published 20 books before this. What, first of all, what led to this very short format? Why, why go so brief? I’m curious, 00:30:39 [Speaker Changed] Barry. It’s really an interesting experience. But for me, I love helping people with investing and I keep trying to think of how can I be helpful and what are the lessons that my children, grandchildren ought to learn? What are the lots that my favorite institutions ought to learn, my local church, whatever it is now, what could I offer that would be helpful? And I thought to myself, you know, the world has changed a lot and some rethinking of what’s the right way to invest might turn out to be a good idea. I should try penciling that out. And the more I tried to scratch it out for the church investment committee, I realized this is something that could easily be used by virtually everybody else. There are some major changes that have taken place and the world of investing is very different than it used to be. And the right way to deal with the world is really different than it used to be. And I owe it to other people because I’ve been blessed with this wonderful privilege of being able to learn from all kinds of people what’s going on in an investment world and how to deal with it and add it all together. I should put this together in this one last short book. And my wife laughed and said, you never get this down to only a hundred pages. I think that’s all it takes. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] You got pretty close. I think it’s like a hundred and something, 102, 104. You, 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] You’re, you’re right there. Yeah. One of those pages is blank. And then there’s several pages that are half blank. So, 00:32:14 [Speaker Changed] Well I it it’s barely a hundred pages. So I, I love this quote from the book over the 20 years ending in mid 2023, investing in a broad based US total market equity fund produced net returns better than more than 90% of professionally managed stock funds that promised to beat the market. Really that’s the heart of, of the book, is that if you invest for 20 plus years, passive indexing, and we’ll talk about passive the phrase in a minute, but basic indexing ends up in the top decile. 00:32:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, you’re talking about 20 years in. Many people say, oh gee, that’s a long time. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You start investing in your twenties, you’ll still be investing in your eighties. That’s a 60 year horizon. And if you’re lucky enough to do well enough, you might leave some to your children and grandchildren. So it might not be 60 years, it might be 80, a hundred, 120 years. Wow. Try to think about that long term because that is a marvelous privilege to have that long a time to be able to be an investor. 00:33:27 [Speaker Changed] And you, you cite the s and p research group, spiva, the average annual return of broad indexes was 1.8 percentage points better than the average actively managed funds. That’s nearly 2% compounding over time. That really adds up, doesn’t it? It 00:33:44 [Speaker Changed] Sure does. And compounding is really important for all of us to recognize that. Some people call it snowball, and I think that’s perfectly fine because as you roll a snowball, every time you roll it over, it gets much thicker, not just a little bit, much thicker than you do compounding at one, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty two, sixty four, a hundred twenty eight. Those last rounds of compounding are really important. So for goodness sake, think about how can you get there so you’ll have those compoundings work for you. 00:34:20 [Speaker Changed] So we mentioned the phrase passive, which has come, 00:34:24 [Speaker Changed] Oh, please don’t do that. Which 00:34:25 [Speaker Changed] Comes with some baggage. But you describe what a historical anomaly, the phrase passive is it it really, why? Why don’t I let you explain? It really just comes from an odd legal usage. Te tell us a little bit about where the word passive came to be when it came to indexing. Glad to the 00:34:44 [Speaker Changed] Indexing is, to me the right word to use. Passive has such a negative connotation. I dunno about you, Barry, but I wouldn’t want anybody to describe me as passive. I’m gonna vote for so-and-so as president of the United States. That’s not gonna be because he’s passive. Passive is a negative term. However, if you’re an electrical engineer, it’s not a pejorative. There’s two parts. There’s two prongs or three prongs on the end of a wire. And there’s a wall socket that’s got either two holes or three holes depending on which electric system you have. The one that has the prongs is called the active part. The one that has the holes is called the passive part. And because indexing was created by a group of electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, they just used what they thought was the sensible terminology. And then other people who had not realized where it came from, saw it as being a negative. I don’t want to be passive. I want to have an active manager who go out there and really do something for me. That is a complete misunderstanding. And it really did terrible harm for index investing to be called passive. 00:36:01 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about some of the other things that index investing has been called. And I put together a short list. ’cause there’s been so much pushback to indexing. It’s been called Marxist Communist Socialist. It’s devouring capitalism. It’s a mania. It’s creating frightening risk for markets. It’s lobotomized investing a danger to the economy, a systemic risk, a bubble waiting to burst. It’s terrible for our economy. Why so much hate for index then? Well, 00:36:35 [Speaker Changed] If you were an active manager and you were life threatened by something that was a better product at a lower cost, you might have some negative commentary too. 00:36:44 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s just as simple as their livelihood is dependent on flows into active, and that’s where all the animus comes from. 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] And it’s, it’s partly livelihood. It’s partly religious faith. It’s partly cultural conviction. It’s partly what I’ve done for most of these people would say, I’ve been doing it for 25 years and I want to keep doing it for 25 years. Oh, by the way, I get paid really well to do it. And I like that job 00:37:08 [Speaker Changed] To continue. Sure. You mentioned, we talked earlier about the temptation, the, that we’re surrounded by temptations to be wrong. I want to talk about some data in the book about what happens if you are wrong and out of the market during some of the best days. And the data point you used was 10,000 trading days over 26 years on average. That’s about 11.2% returns. So if you have money in broad market indices over 26 years, 10,000 trading sections, you’re averaging 11.2% annually. If you miss only the 10 best days, not a year, but over those 10,000 trading days, that 11.2% drops to 9.2%, 20 days down, seven point to 7.7% a year. And if you miss the 30 best days out of 10,000, the return goes from 11.2 to 6.4, almost a 500 basis point drop. That’s amazing. Tell us about that. 00:38:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, first of all, you have to recognize when you select out the most extreme days, it does have a really big impact. The second thing is, when do those days come? And the best days usually come shortly after the worst days. Right? The bounce, the, Hey, wait a minute, this market is not as bad as everybody’s saying. It really does have terrific opportunity and that’s when the best days typically come. So the time that we all get frightened and all of us get unnerved is the wrong, the most wrong time to be taking action. 00:39:03 [Speaker Changed] And and the statistical basis is those 10 days are only 0.1% of total training sessions. But you’re giving up one fifth of the gains that that’s an amazing asymmetry 00:39:18 [Speaker Changed] And it’s a hell of a great lesson to learn. Hang in there steady. Eddie does pay off. 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] Another quote from the book, why should investors care about the day-to- day or even month to month fluctuations in prices if they have no plans to sell anytime soon? That sounds so perfectly obvious when you hear it. Why are people so drawn into the noise? 00:39:42 [Speaker Changed] Well, when I advise people on investing, I always start with, what do you most want to accomplish? And then the second question is, when do you plan to sell your securities? And most people say, well, what do you mean when do I plan to sell? Well, when are you most likely to say, I need money out of my securities investment for life spending probably in retirement. Oh yeah. And then they’ll give you a date and then you say, and how far out into the future is that? And then really want to be difficult for somebody say, okay, that’s 43 years out into the future. Let’s go back 43 years. Tell me what you think was happening 43 years ago. Today’s date, 43 years ago. I have no idea. Why do you ask? Well, I’m asking because you have no idea and you have no idea 43 years into the future. And the reason for that is because you don’t care. It’s the long term trend that you care about and you care greatly about that. But you don’t care about the day to day to day fluctuations. 00:40:53 [Speaker Changed] So you, you sum up the book by pointing out every investor today has three great gifts, time compounding and ETF and indexing discuss 00:41:07 [Speaker Changed] Time to be able to have the experience of compounding where you each compounding round, you double what you had. Boy does it really pay off to benefit it for the long term and have saved early enough so that you compound a larger amount. But that leap from one to two is not very exciting. Two to four is not much. Four to eight’s, not really all that much. Eight to 16 starts to attract your attention. 16 to 32, that’s really something. 32 to 64 and to 128. Holy smokes. I want that last doubling. That’s really a payoff only way you get there. You start early and stay on course compounding away as best you can. 00:41:57 [Speaker Changed] You know, you, you people have pointed out, and I think you referenced this in the book, that as successful as Warren Buffet has been over his whole career because of the doubling, it depends on the rule of 72, but let’s say every seven or eight years, half of your gains have come in the most recent seven and a half, eight year era. And Warren’s now in his nineties, and the vast majority of his wealth have only happened in the past 10, 15 years. It’s kind of fascinating. 00:42:30 [Speaker Changed] Well, he’s a brilliant and wonderful human being, and all of us can learn great lessons from paying attention to what Warren says or has said. And his annual meetings are a treasure chest of opportunities to learn. But he did start as a teenager, not in his mid twenties, but in his early teens. And then he is not stopping at 65. He’s roaring right past that. And when you bolt on those extra years, it gives him a much larger playing field in which the double and double and redouble and redouble and all of us ought to pay attention to that one most powerful lesson. If you’ve got the time, the impact of compounding really is terrific. And the only way you get to be have the time is to do it yourself. Save enough early enough and stay with it long enough to let the compounding take place. But it’s inevitable. Power of compounding is just wonderful to have on your side. 00:43:34 [Speaker Changed] So three of the things I want to talk about from the book first, as alpha became harder and harder to achieve as it became more difficult to beat very good competition, the aspect of reducing costs, reducing fees, reducing taxes, became another way of generating better returns. Tell us a little bit about what led you to that conclusion and what firms like BlackRock and Vanguard have done to to further that belief system. 00:44:09 [Speaker Changed] Variance really candidly, just been pay attention to what the numbers say and pay attention to the data. And the data is so powerfully, consistently strong that active investing is a exciting idea. And in the right time and circumstance, the 1960s, it worked beautifully, but the circumstances now are so different that it doesn’t work beautifully. It works candidly, negatively, huh. 00:44:40 [Speaker Changed] Two other things I wanna go over. One is the concept of total financial portfolio. Meaning when you’re looking at your allocation, you should include the present value of your future social security payments and the equity value of your home as sort of bond-like. And that should help you shift your allocation a little away from bonds, a little more into equities. Tell us about that. 00:45:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think it’s one of those ideas that once it pops into your mind, you’ll never walk away from it. Most of us have no idea what the total value of our future stream of pay payouts from social security are. But you can do the calculation fairly simply. Most of us would be really impressed if they, if we realized how much is the real value of that future stream of payments that are coming from the best credit in the world. Federal government. Huh. So, and that’s inflation protected. So it’s even better than most people would imagine. That’s the single most valuable asset for most people. And the second most valuable asset for most people is the value of their home. And I know people would say their first reactions, but I’m not gonna sell my home. I’m gonna continue to live there. Fine, true. But someday either your children or your grandchildren will say, we don’t really wanna live in that same house, so we’re going to sell it. 00:46:08 So it does have an economic value. And it will be realized at some point down the line, take those two and put them side by side with your securities. And most people would say, my God, I’ve got more in the way of fixed income and fixed in bond equivalents than I had ever imagined. I think I ought to be careful in my securities part of the portfolio to rethink things and probably be substantially more committed to equities in my securities portfolio because I’ve got these other things that I was never counting on before. But now that I’ve been told about it, I really want to include that as my understanding to the total picture. 00:46:50 [Speaker Changed] And, and I like the concept of outside the market decisions versus inside the market decisions. Explain the difference between the two. 00:47:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, outside market decisions have to do with what’s changed in your life. Most obvious being when you retire, but sometimes it’s when you get a better job and a higher pay, or even you get a signif significant bonus because of the wonderful achievement that you’d had during the particular year when your circumstances get changed. Oh, and getting married is another real change. When the circumstances change, you really ought to rethink your investment program just to be sure that it’s really right for your present total picture, 00:47:38 [Speaker Changed] Ma. Makes a lot of sense. I know I only have you for a few more minutes. Let me jump to three of my favorite questions that I ask all my guests. Starting with, what are some of your favorite books? What are you reading right now? 00:47:54 [Speaker Changed] My favorite books tend to be history. And the one that I’ve most recently read is a wonderful biography of Jack Kennedy as President and the things that he did that made America the most popular country in the world. 00:48:13 [Speaker Changed] And our last two questions. What advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in investing? 00:48:21 [Speaker Changed] Think about what really motivates you to be interested in investing. If it’s because it’s a high income field, that’s okay, but candidly, it’s not an inspiration and you only have one life to lead Is, is it your desire to lead your life making money or doing something that you would say was at the end of your life, I’m so proud of, have what I did, or I’m so glad I did what I did. If you’re thinking about investing because it’s a profession where you help people be more successful at achieving their objectives, then candidly, you could have a fabulous time. It won’t come because you beat the market, but that’s not the problem for most people. For most people, beating the market is very clearly secondary to what’s their real need, which is to think through what are their objectives, what are their financial resources, and how can they put those together into the best for them Investment program. And the same thing is true for every college, every hospital, every college, church, every organization that has an endowment needs to think carefully about what is the real purpose of the money and how can we do the best for our long-term success by the structure of the portfolio that we have. 00:49:44 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today that would’ve been really useful back in the 1960s when you were working for the Rockefellers? 00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. First that the whole world is gonna be changing. So don’t stay with what you think is really great about the early 1960s because all of that is gonna be upended and all the lessons that you would think were just great about how to do things in the early 1960s. We’ll work against you then. By the time you get to the this time of the year, you’ll be making mistakes, one after another, after another, after another by doing things that are just completely out of date. And the world of investing will change more than most fields will change. Computer technology will change more. Airplane travel will change more. But candidly, investing is gonna change so much that if you take the lessons that you’re learning for how to do it in the sixties and try to transport those into the 2000 and twenties, you’re gonna pay a terrible price. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. 00:50:55 [Speaker Changed] Thank you, Charlie, for sharing all of your wisdom and insights. I really greatly appreciate it.
