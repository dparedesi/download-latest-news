Title: Wachtell Lipton Discusses Court Ruling that BlackRock’s Inclusion as Investment Manager Breaches ERISA Duty of Loyalty
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/01/22/wachtell-lipton-discusses-court-ruling-that-blackrocks-inclusion-as-investment-manager-breaches-erisa-duty-of-loyalty/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T05:01:03Z
Full Content:
The District Court for the Northern District of Texas recently ruled that a company breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) for permitting BlackRock’s inclusion as an investment manager of its employees’ retirement assets in a 401(k) Plan. After a four-day bench trial, the Court found that the company failed to “loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests by allowing their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan.” Core to the Court’s holding is its evidentiary determination that BlackRock “pursues a pervasive ESG agenda” that “covertly converts the retirement plan’s core index portfolios to ESG funds,” and that this harms the financial interests of 401(k) participants. As we have noted in prior memos, including The Future of ESG: Thoughts for Boards and Management in 2024, the politicization of ESG has led to “anti-ESG” legislation in several states and a general corporate and investor retreat from use of the term. BlackRock itself has publicly disavowed the term and recently began expanding voting choice programs to include voting policies that oppose energy transition and decarbonization efforts to appeal to a wider swath of its client base and allay the concerns of regulators. The Court ruling notes these recent moves, including BlackRock’s 2024 announcement that it was leaving Climate Action 100+, citing these distancing efforts as “telling” evidence of BlackRock’s “apparent recognition” that ESG investing was problematic under ERISA. The Court found that the company “turned a blind eye to BlackRock’s ESG activism,” and did not sufficiently “monitor, evaluate, and address” the extent to which BlackRock was pursuing a “non-pecuniary ESG investment strategy.” The ruling described BlackRock’s influence over the company—as one of the company’s largest shareholders and a significant debt holder—as the explanation for the company’s “lack of accountability with respect to BlackRock.” This ruling adds an additional layer of consideration for companies and boards seeking to navigate the evolving regulatory and legal landscape on ESG matters. It remains an appropriate and essential part of business judgment for companies to evaluate how key business risks—including those related to the environment, employees, and communities in which companies operate—may impact long-term performance. A number of companies are carefully crafting how they message their policies and thoughtfully considering the specific language they are using. Companies need to continue to be mindful of the current environment as they chart their path forward. This post comes to us from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. It is based on the firm’s memorandum, “District Court Rules BlackRock’s Inclusion as 401(k) Investment Manager Breaches Company’s ERISA Duty of Loyalty,” dated January 13, 2025.

Title: BlackRock and Weinstein's Saba reach settlement in battle over closed-end funds

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Saba Capital Management announced a standstill in a long-raging battle over the future of closed-end funds with the asset manager buying back shares in two portfolios and the hedge fund dropping demands for deep management changes. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it will buy back 50% of outstanding shares in its BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust and 40% of outstanding shares in Health Sciences Term Trust for a price of 99.5% of each fund's net asset value. A total of roughly $1.6 billion is being tendered in these funds alone, more than has ever been available to investors. In return, Saba, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, agreed to stop its campaigns at dozens of BlackRock funds calling for fresh directors to be installed and for BlackRock to be fired as some of the funds' manager. The agreement lasts for three proxy seasons. "This is a monumental outcome for shareholders," Saba's founder Boaz Weinstein wrote on social media platform X. He said the settlement shows how shareholders and managers can find a "win-win" solution. "By committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors." Saba's Weinstein has for years waged a battle against closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other companies that oversee billions of dollars, arguing they charge high fees and deliver lackluster returns with limited opportunities for average investors to get their money out. The settlement comes some seven months after BlackRock shareholders voted at 10 of its closed-end funds to keep the asset manager's directors in place and retain it as the manager at six funds. Saba has long criticized the gap between the assets held by closed-end funds and their share prices and wanted to install new directors and at some funds fire the manager. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. Weinstein has been crusading against these types of portfolios for some time and late last year took his fight overseas by urging shareholders in seven UK investment trusts to replace directors and install his hedge fund as the manager. He argued the current boards failed to deliver "sufficient shareholder returns." (This story has been corrected to say that investors voted at a total of 10 funds, not 4, in paragraph 7)

Title: Banks Ditch Net Zero as Climate Alliances Crumble

More Info A few years ago, the world’s biggest banks and asset managers raced to commit to funding the energy transition and drop fossil fuel projects from portfolios as they came under shareholder and market pressure to join net-zero alliances. But after years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory. Net Zero Exodus The top U.S. banks and four of Canada’s largest banks are no longer part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Now several European banks are considering withdrawing from the NZBA, too, while the leading figures of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – the umbrella group for the finance institutions that have pledged net zero goals – are struggling to hold their regular annual meeting this month, the Financial Times reports, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. Some of Europe’s biggest banks are rethinking their membership and involvement in net-zero initiatives as Donald Trump returns to office and Republican-led U.S. states are going after “woke capital.” This, they say, discriminates against America’s oil, gas, and coal industry by committing to net-zero portfolios and adopting principles that could reduce financing for fossil fuel projects. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the NZBA. Commenting on the banks’ withdrawals, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, “More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, early this month quit the parallel Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Trump was elected U.S. President. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients. Net Zero Under Scrutiny BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. Since leaving the net-zero asset managers’ alliance, BlackRock has reached a settlement with the state of Tennessee, which had sued the world’s biggest asset manager for misleading consumers regarding the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in its investment practices. The settlement concluded a lawsuit filed by the State of Tennessee under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). “The Americans are totally obsessed about not being sued by Texas. The banks have been the worst,” a European executive involved in the Glasgow initiative told FT. Canadian banks BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group, and CIBC also quit the net-zero banking alliance last week. European lenders have threatened to follow suit unless NZBA eases rules and ends “all formal tracking and any issues that are perceived contrary to US antitrust”, according to FT’s sources. The asset managers’ net zero alliance is already struggling under the pressure. A week ahead of President Trump’s inauguration, the Net Zero Asset Managers said it was launching a review of the initiative. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the alliance said. While the review is ongoing, the initiative is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. European banks want the net-zero banking alliance to undergo a similar overhaul. Otherwise, they have threatened to quit and follow in the footsteps of the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks. “Several banks have said that unless the banking alliance goes the same way [as] the asset management initiative, they will begin the process to leave,” a source familiar with the banks’ thinking told FT.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks. Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen’s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. In 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities. The firm employs over 1,800 people and operates across multiple global offices. Point72 combines Cohen’s expertise in active trading with investments in technology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of modern finance. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Point72 Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A physician and a patient having a discussion in a hospital about biopharmaceutical medicines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 Point72 Asset Management’s Stake: $193.2 million Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a California-based biotechnology company founded in 1987. The following features make this company a strong investment case. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 indicates the company’s success in expanding its product offerings and capturing demand in critical healthcare segments, which may attract investment. For instance, as per the report, product sales increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023 and total third-quarter 2024 product sales, excluding Veklury, increased 7% to $6.8 billion compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Oncology and Liver Disease. Secondly, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) presented the results of the pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 2 trial, which is studying twice-yearly lenacapavir, the company’s injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, for the investigational use of HIV prevention. This may attract investment as it holds the potential to increase revenue streams, estimated to be over $10 billion. Moreover, the company is also advancing its oncology pipeline, including therapies for multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Overall, GILD ranks 11th on our list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GILD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than GILD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Calamos’ first “Protected Bitcoin ETF” will hit the market Wednesday, offering investors 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price with limited upside potential. From retail investors to financial advisors, Bitcoin’s risk profile has deterred a notable number of market participants who may be wary of Bitcoin’s steep drawdowns despite its growing adoption, Calamos Head of ETFs Matt Kaufman told Decrypt. “Calamos has built Bitcoin exposure with a safety net, and you can choose how low that safety net goes,” he said. “Bitcoin is a historically extremely volatile asset, and so a lot of people have been on the sidelines watching this experiment turn into an institutional reality.” Calamos’ ETFs will be listed on the Cboe, with its 100% Protected Bitcoin ETF set to debut at a price of $25 Wednesday. The product’s so-called cap range, expected to be anywhere between 10% to 11.5%, will be struck at the end of the day. From that point on, the ETF will aim to offer 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price, with a cap range struck again next year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the U.S. last year, notching $36.2 billion worth of net inflows as investors and traders flocked to products from Wall Street giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has climbed 133% from $46,000 to nearly $107,000, yet some analysts say that registered investment advisors and wirehouses are still warming up to such products. Among institutional investors, 48% of those surveyed in 2023 said that digital assets’ price volatility was a considerable obstacle from an investment standpoint—citing that factor more than anything else, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets report. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents pointed to self-custody concerns, which spot ETFs largely availed. In two weeks, Calamos—which was founded in 1977—will launch additional ETFs with 80% and 90% downside protection against Bitcoin. Those products will have an estimated cap range of 28% to 31% and 50% to 55%, respectively. The products’ risk management framework will be achieved through a combination of U.S. Treasuries and flex options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index, according to Calamos’ website. Flex options are essentially customizable exchange-listed options, which can have a one-year outcome period, as opposed to expiring on the final Friday of each month, Kaufman said. Calamos, which has $40 billion in assets under management, launched similar products covering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last year. Though the products could find use among a professional investment crowd, Kaufman posited that the products could also cater to investors beyond the typical age of your typical crypto bro. “The adoption for Bitcoin has been on the individual or retail level, and it's largely been people younger than myself,” the 45-year-old Kaufman said. “We haven't seen too much of the adoption curve from those older investors, largely because of the risk tolerance that they just can't take.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

By Doyinsola Oladipo (Reuters) -Three days after ByteDance's TikTok went dark and then was quickly revived in the United States, users who deleted the app were anxiously checking iPhone and Android devices to find it still unavailable to be downloaded again. Some looking to make a quick profit from TikTok fans' desperation listed devices on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) with the app purportedly downloaded for up to $50,000. TikTok still could not be downloaded from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google app stores in the United States on Tuesday, trapped in legal purgatory by the two tech giants. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday delaying the enforcement of a ban on the Chinese-owned popular short-video app by 75 days, the legality of which is unclear. TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, but it was yet to return to app stores. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including Lemon8 and CapCut, were also no longer available. Meanwhile the search to find a buyer for TikTok continued. Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Elon Musk's buying the app if the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO wanted to do so. And the chair of the House Select Committee on China, John Moolenaar, met businessmen Kevin O'Leary and Frank McCourt about the potential divestiture of TikTok. Billionaire businessman McCourt's Project Liberty consortium has made a formal offer to buy it, valuing the app without its algorithm at around $20 billion. O'Leary joined the effort, Project Liberty said earlier this month. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, O’Leary said he would be interested in a TikTok deal, but it’s not possible under current law. "That 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer ... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court," the investor told CNBC. The back-and-forth has brought out mixed feelings from users, including some who planned to abandon TikTok after seeing Trump so heavily involved in the negotiations that could result in TikTok eventually being sold to one of his allies in the tech industry. "I do not want to continue being a pawn in this hellscape. I am not saying it will make a difference to TikTok but it will make a difference to me," said Nicole Norman, a TikTok user, on Meta's Threads app. "I will not be back on TikTok." Others, however, want TikTok back, which is not possible as long as Apple and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do not make it available. "I’ve been checking every day," said travel content creator Lauren Scott. Scott, 29, currently in Brazil, read in some Facebook (NASDAQ:META) groups that Americans abroad may be able to access the app if they deleted and re-downloaded it. But that proved not to be the case, leaving her in limbo. The delay may be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app, according to analysts. A notice on Apple's App Store said: "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in". Google Play showed: "Downloads for this app are paused due to current U.S. legal requirements." Some users have been tinkering with multi-step processes to gain access, such as trying to change their location in their phones. "Really hoping TikTok comes back to the app store ASAP, not wanting to do any of that VPN stuff to get it back," said Lauren Nader, a TikTok user, on Threads. Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. legislators last year passed a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a ban, citing national security concerns. Many Democratic and Republican lawmakers still want to see ByteDance sell the app. Trump suggested the United States government should be a half-owner of TikTok's U.S. business in return for keeping the app alive, and warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a deal. China indicated this week for the first time it would be open to a transaction keeping TikTok operating in the United States, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that companies "decide independently" on matters of their operations and deals. Some users still on TikTok have suggested that the app's algorithm is "feeling different" since it came back online, fanned by fears about the future of the tool under a new ownership structure. TikTok welcomed users back on Sunday with the message, "Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!" "I deactivated my account after it was 'back' this morning. I'm done with [Trump] taking credit for the messes he starts," said TikTok user Janel Samson on Threads. Over 200 iPhone and Android devices with the app downloaded were listed on the site for sale as of Tuesday night.

Title: TikTok Might Never Be Listed On Apple’s App Store Again, Unless It Cuts Ties With Parent Company ByteDance And Is Acquired By A U.S. Entity
URL: https://wccftech.com/tiktok-might-never-appear-on-apple-app-store-except-for-one-condition/
Time Published: 2025-01-21T21:00:06Z
Full Content:
The ban on TikTok enforced by the government was superseded by an executive order signed by the new U.S. President Donald Trump that allows the short-video-uploading platform to be shielded by this ban for 75 days. In short, it has been a roller-coaster ride, one that Apple and Google have been forced to be a part of since the app was listed on each company’s online store. The reason for banning TikTok comes from its ties with parent company ByteDance, with the authorities believing that the app presents a national security risk to the nation. Despite the executive order signed, Apple and Google have yet to re-enlist TikTok on their respective app stores, and from the looks of it, both technology giants will maintain this stance unless a U.S. firm acquires the video-hosting service. Assuming that it was not clear before, Apple has mentioned the following details in a new support document, summarizing that TikTok and all other applications that have been developed and controlled by ByteDance will not be available to download or update on the Cupertino firm’s App Store. “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.” To clear the confusion, even though Donald Trump has signed an executive order, which protects TikTok and its supporting partners from a ban for 75 days, various experts have stated that the federal law will remain in place, regardless of Trump’s executive order. The only exception for TikTok to continue working in the U.S. is if the newly elected President can prove to Congress that the video-uploading platform has severed its ties with ByteDance and is now owned by a U.S. entity. Since none of the above conditions have been met so far, it is no surprise that Apple and Google are unwilling to bring TikTok back to their app stores, as such an action would likely result in exorbitant fines. For those wondering, 60 percent of TikTok’s ownership comprises of institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, with its founders and global employees owning 20 percent each.

We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin's Institutional Era Hits Epic 3,000,000 BTC Milestone

U.Today - Institutional adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to accelerate, with treasuries now collectively holding 3,000,000 BTC valued at $317 billion. This represents 14% of the total supply that will ever exist, reveals self-proclaimed Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo. MicroStrategy remains the largest single corporate holder, having recently acquired an additional 11,000 BTC for $1.1 billion at an average price of $101,191 per BTC. The company’s total holdings now stand at 461,000 BTC, worth approximately $29.3 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $63,110 per BTC. Other notable holders include MARA Holdings, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, which ranks second, with 44,893 BTC valued at $4.65 billion. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), another mining firm, follows in third place, with 17,722 BTC worth around $1.84 billion. A broader analysis shows that the structure of these institutional holdings is diverse. Spot Bitcoin ETFs account for 1,307,868 BTC, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) commanding a significant portion of this category, holding 563,134 BTC valued at $58.29 billion. Public companies, including MicroStrategy, collectively hold 608,381 BTC. Governments, such as those of China and the United States, own 513,199 BTC, with each holding at least 190,000 BTC. Additionally, 407,212 BTC are held by private companies like Block One, and 165,677 BTC are locked within DeFi protocols as wrapped Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin is becoming more popular as an investment is shown by the fact that institutions are getting into it. Large entities are playing a key role in the market's growth, whether they are investing directly, using it as collateral or diversifying their treasury. As this trend continues, the long-term impact on Bitcoin's adoption and its price dynamics could be huge. This article was originally published on U.Today

Bird Song of the Day Brown Thrasher, May 2024 Rondeau PP–South Point Trail East, Chatham-Kent, Ontario, Canada. Same location as yesterday, but different birds and even more lively. * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Capitol Seizure “Trump pardons roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack” [NBC News]. “President Donald Trump on Monday issued roughly 1,500 pardons and commuted the sentences of 14 of his supporters in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when thousands of them stormed the building amid his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him. Trump commuted the sentences of individuals associated with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy [despite being riddled with informers]. He then issued ‘a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,’ a category that included people who assaulted law enforcement officers.” • This from Julie Kelly was something I didn’t know: Here is the raindrop theory– “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. JOHN DOUGLAS WRIGHT” (PDF) [Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, Criminal Action No. 21-341, United States District Court for the District of Columbia]. Kollar-Kotelly was “previously presiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.” From page 24: It would have been interesting to apply the “raindrop” theory of the case to the banksters who “collectively” caused the Great Financial Crash, causing “the unnecessary expenditure of substantial government resources.” Trump Transition Lambert here: Patient readers, Trump just signed a hundred exective orders (EOs) [apparently only 26? Yes] and held a presser. I don’t have the capacity to synthesize all that material, which is doubtless creating “Shock and Awe” in the political class. The links that follow seem the most salient now, but that may change in the coming weeks. What I will say is that I have skimmed several of the orders, and this latest rollout is an amazing feat of staffwork (hat tip Susie Wiles) that the previous Trump administration couldn’t even have considered. (Some clever people will also have to lay the Executive Orders against Project 2025 and look for overlaps. My guess is that the Trump administration will have put its own distinction twists on a lot of it. Also, I’ll often scatter the EOs under the usual category headings (“DOGE” under “DOGE”) because consolidating 100 EOs in one place would be unwieldy. Patient readers, I’ll return with a list of the executive orders — I’m frustrated because I don’t know how many have really been signed — after I handle some administrativia. –lambert UPDATE Here is the list. I took it from the Whitehouse.gov page on “Presidential Actions.” There are four buckets: Executive Orders, Proclamations, Memoranda, and Announcements. (I did this because all the sources I could find were explainers, a level of abstraction away from a simple list of the documents Trump signed, which seems to me to be the obvious base for any further analysis.) Executive Orders: Proclamations: Memoranda: Announcements: So this is the scope of the work for today; Trump was busy. Perhaps a connoisseuer of Federal document types can explain why an Executive Order in one case and a Memorandum in another. I did skim some of the EOs; they seem to be of varying quality, some quite specific as to statute and regulation, others more like “good things are good” handwaving. For example, in “Restoring Freedom Of Speech And Ending Federal Censorship”, this: Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to: (a) secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech; and: Sec. 3. Ending Censorship of Protected Speech. (a) No Federal department, agency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any Federal resources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order. Constitutional lawyers in the readership please correct me, but am I right that this is a little thin? Not even a citation to a court case? And “constitutionally” is doing a lot of work. Is there speech that is not constitutionally protected? * * * “Trump signs order to end ‘government censorship’ of social media” [WaPo]. “President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order intended to ‘immediately stop all government censorship,’ a sweeping action that could chill years of efforts to combat the proliferation of false information online. The order bans federal officials from any conduct that ‘would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.’ It also prohibits taxpayer resources from being used to ‘unconstitutionally abridge the free speech’ of Americans…. Trump’s order could have an immediate impact on years of efforts to bolster coordination between Silicon Valley and the government to combat misinformation about elections, natural disasters and public health.” • But: TikTok is dead, free Palestine pic.twitter.com/hQKK0trAlW — Ozymandias (@martianmarxist) January 21, 2025 However: so my tiktok didn’t seem the same when i got back on, so i went and muted all ads and turned off personalized ads, and now i can actually see things about Palestine and fascism pic.twitter.com/mwLLfs7shl — jess (@jesstechnician) January 21, 2025 Eight hours down not long enough to implement the algo changes properly? * * * “Neo-Nazis Love the Nazi-Like Salutes Elon Musk Made at Trump’s Inauguration” [Wired]. “At this point, Musk put his right hand on his chest before extending it straight out with his palm facing down and his fingers touching, a gesture widely recognized as the ‘Roman salute.’ Adopted by the fascist movement a century ago, it was most famously used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, and is to this day associated with the fascist right, especially in Italy. After he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture. ‘My heart goes out to you,’ Musk added… One of many examples: “”WE ARE FUCKING BACK” the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute.'” • I must confess that when I first saw this take I filed under symbol manipulators looking for symbols and then making leaps in reasoning based on the symbols (which is a very bad habit in the idpol space). I also felt that Musk has been awfully herky jerky lately (and there is the preliminary hand-on-heart gesture, which forms no part of the Nazi salute. But now, apparently, it does: “It was an accident!! He’s autistic!!” pic.twitter.com/eOCgJ4cPBr — evan loves worf (@esjesjesj) January 21, 2025 File this, at the very minimum, under “Somebody needs to get this dude under control.” * * * DOGE “ESTABLISHING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRESIDENT’S ‘DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT'” [Whitehouse.gov]. I normalize all-caps to title caps but in this case I’m not, because all the EOs have this formatting. I hope readers can give this a close reading, but while the pre-inaugural DOGE set a horrid precedent, this version seems not so bad. The EO hijacks the United States Digital Service (USDS), which Obama put in place after Silicon Valley techies saved his bacon my making the ObamaCare website work. That’s a clever idea! ” The United States Digital Service is hereby publicly renamed as the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and shall be established in the Executive Office of the President.” And: “In consultation with USDS, each Agency Head shall establish within their respective Agencies a DOGE Team of at least four employees, which may include Special Government Employees, hired or assigned within thirty days of the date of this Order. Agency Heads shall select the DOGE Team members in consultation with the USDS Administrator. Each DOGE Team will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney. Agency Heads shall ensure that DOGE Team Leads coordinate their work with USDS and advise their respective Agency Heads on implementing the President ‘s DOGE Agenda.” • This shows, at least, somebody was thinking about process. (“Special Government Employees” were what the the pre-inaugural DOGE operatives — the dudes going around interviewing civil servants — should have been. “‘Everyone wants him out’: How Musk helped boot Ramaswamy from DOGE” [Politico]. “Musk, the tech tycoon and Donald Trump confidant, made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE in recent days, according to three people familiar with Musk’s preferences who, like others for this article, were granted anonymity to discuss them. An ill-received holiday rant on X by Ramaswamy about H-1B visas apparently hastened his demise…. Ramaswamy maintained to confidants as late as Saturday evening that he was actively involved in DOGE, saying he was at work writing executive orders, according to six people who had spoken with him. But a person familiar with the arrangement said he had done almost no DOGE-related work since early December. As recently as last week, Ramaswamy was hoping to achieve some early wins at DOGE before leaving to pursue a gubernatorial bid. Now Ramaswamy and his allies are laboring to put a positive spin on his departure, coming just as Trump takes office.” • 2024 Post Mortem “The Sad Tale of Moderate Joe Biden” [Ruy Teixeira, The Liberal Patriot]. The interesting part of this article is at the end: “Editor’s note: This is a slightly longer version of an essay that originally appeared in The Free Press, where Ruy is now a contributing writer.” • This dude is nimble! “Biden Was Just That Bad” [Caitlyn Johnstone, Consortium News]. “From what we are seeing so far, Trump is just returning things to their horrible standard baseline. Trump will go on to do many evil things as president, just as he did during his first term, but none of this will reverse the fact that Biden just spent four years advancing genocide, nuclear brinkmanship and authoritarianism. The Democratic Party plays just as crucial a role in promoting the tyranny and abuses of the U.S. empire as the Republican Party does, and it is nonsensical to think of either of them as a lesser evil. The empire itself must end. It’s possible that Trump’s term will constitute another swing from Bush-level depravity to Obama-level depravity. It isn’t normal for the U.S. empire to be as openly depraved as it has been in Gaza. Normally its evils are much more well-disguised, because it is in the empire’s interests to preserve its image in the eyes of the western public. You only see the really in-your-face acts of monstrosity when a coalition of forces within the swamp are able to seize on a rare opportunity to shove them through, as we saw in the wake of 9/11 and again in the wake of Oct. 7. The rest of the time, the empire likes to be a lot subtler about its abuses, like it was during the Obama administration and the first Trump administration.” • One could, I suppose, consider engulfing Greenland as “subtle” compared to a full-blown war with China. And it’s certainly subtle for Trump! Realignment and Legitimacy “Trump rescinds Biden’s census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps” [NPR]. “Among the dozens of Biden-era executive orders that President Trump revoked on Monday was one that had reversed the first Trump administration’s unprecedented policy of altering a key set of census results. Since the first U.S. census in 1790, no resident has ever been omitted from those numbers because of immigration status. And after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment has called for the population counts that determine each state’s share of U.S. House seats and Electoral College votes to include the ‘whole number of persons in each state.’ Biden’s now-revoked 2021 order affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in each state in those census results. It was issued in response to Trump’s attempt during the national tally in 2020 to exclude millions of U.S. residents without legal status…. Though it had an opportunity during the first Trump administration, the Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether the president can exclude people who are in the country without legal status from the tally that determines political power in the United States.” • Well, when you frame it that way… Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

September 2024. “This report introduces the Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS), which utilizes a multi-modal approach to enhance efficacy. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi-modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre-exposure dose of PCANS leads to a >99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily-use prophylactic against respiratory infections.” • Maybe one day it will be on sale… Maskstravaganza If you are only permitted a surgical mask: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 Here is one modification: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 Here is another: here is a non-exhaustive thread on the various modifications you can apply to surgical masks to increase their efficacy at preventing airborne illness (95% effective like N95 masks). combining these modifications will increase your mask's efficacy 🧵 — a southern souliloquoy (@niggasippian) January 18, 2025 There are a lot more techniques; the thread is worth reading in full. Vaccines “Former surgeon general: Vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat” [Jerome Adams, STAT]. The Biden Administration vaccine rollout was fantastically destructive, as we see here. “While there’s much to celebrate about the current focus on improving overall health — particularly the incoming administration’s emphasis on the MAHA agenda, which promotes better food safety, nutrition, and physical activity — it’s crucial that we remember these must be priorities in addition to addressing vaccine-preventable diseases, not in place of them. As I’ve said before, you can’t die of early heart disease at 50 if you already died from polio at 5. The reality is that vaccine-preventable diseases are still a major threat, even in the 21st century, and we ignore that at our peril. I hear from pediatricians and health officials across the country on a near-daily basis about their growing concerns over declining vaccination rates. Parents who would have once trusted their health care providers’ recommendations are now questioning vaccines that should be routine, like MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella). What’s even more troubling is that even the parents of long-term patients — children who have received all their vaccines in the past — are increasingly opting to delay or forgo these essential shots due to new doubts, often fueled by misinformation. What’s worse is that the default response to health provider recommendations has shifted. For many parents, the idea of questioning, deferring, or outright rejecting vaccines has become the norm, rather the exception. This undermines the trust that has been built over generations between health care providers and families, and presents a serious challenge for those of us trying to protect the health of all Americans, especially our children. The impact of this growing vaccine hesitancy will, of course, be felt most acutely by children whose parents are trying, in deeply misguided ways, to protect them. While we’re unlikely to see a dramatic rise in deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. in the near term, the personal costs are immense. A single case of measles can lead to weeks of missed school, sporting events, family gatherings, and other milestones. These are costs many Americans felt were unbearable and inexcusable during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet we’re now putting our children at risk of suffering the same disruptions — disruptions that are both preventable and unnecessary.” • As I said, it’s MMR that’s under-assault. Of course, we have already been induced to abandon our children to Covid — thanks, Great Barrington dudes — so everything’s going according to plan.

Traveler positivity is up, and worse, the dominant traveler variants are JN* and KP*, which, while present in the national variants, are very low. And in the two death charts, the projected deaths seem to have leveled out, when in the past they decreased.

This implausible Medieval forest of towers, as dense as Manhattan skyscrapers, is our best reconstruction of the town of Bologna at its height, toward the end of the Medieval Guelph-Ghibelline wars. Wealthy families built these as mini-fortresses within the city, where they could defend against riots, enemy families (think Montagues and Capulets) and invasion. Signs of wealth and prestige, these all-stone buildings were also fireproof, leading to a terrible but effective tactic: take your family, treasures & goods up into your tower then set fire to enemies’ homes and let the city burn around you while you sit safe above. This was VERY BAD for cities.” Like this: Caption: “Looks fake, doesn’t it?

Reflections prompted by the Neil Gaiman case. “There’s a moment in the Gaiman exposé where the main accuser, Scarlett Pavlovich, sends him a text message asking him how he’s doing. Gaiman says he’s struggling: he’s heard from people close to him that Pavlovich plans to accuse him of rape. ‘I thought that we were a good thing and a very consensual thing indeed,’ he writes. ‘It was consensual (and wonderful)!” she replies. Except: she doesn’t mean it.” But: “[I]n the article we’ve been instructed, explicitly and repeatedly, that you can’t assume a relationship was consensual just because all parties involved gave consent.” And: “The thing is, if women can’t be trusted to assert their desires or boundaries because they’ll invariably lie about what they want in order to please other people, it’s not just sex they can’t reasonably consent to. It’s medical treatments. Car loans. Nuclear non-proliferation agreements. Our entire social contract operates on the premise that adults are strong enough to choose their choices, no matter the ambient pressure from horny men or sleazy used car salesmen or power-hungry ayatollahs. If half the world’s adult population are actually just smol beans — hapless, helpless, fickle, fragile, and much too tender to perform even the most basic self-advocacy — everything starts to fall apart, including the entire feminist project. You can’t have genuine equality for women while also letting them duck through the trap door of but I didn’t mean it, like children, when their choices have unhappy outcomes.” Class Warfare “New ‘oligarchy’ under fire as elites descend on Davos” [Agence France Presse]. Of course, the elite of the elite are at the Inaugural. “The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week…. Some 3,000 participants are expected at the Swiss ski village for the forum ending Friday — including 60 heads of state or government and more than 900 CEOs — for days of schmoozing and behind-the-scenes dealmaking.” A dissenting voice: “‘I don’t want to live in a country with a few rich people and lots of poor people,’ said Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment giant BlackRock.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Los Angeles County SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration as a percentage of the Winter 2023-2024 peak concentration value: 12/7/24: 18% 12/14/24: 19% 12/21/24: 19% 12/28/24: 24% http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/data/index.htm The value for the end of December probably represents the peak for the season. We can definitively say that this winter’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was only one-quarter of last year’s prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. It takes two weeks to get the lab results. “We can definitively say…” Based on what, exactly? With all of the manipulation going on with Covid-19 data reporting I have exactly zero confidence in any such statements, regardless of the source. I wonder what the injured police at the Jan 6 riot think about the pardoning of their attackers? And how the families of those killed view $Trump’s pardons? Remind us who was killed on Jan 6, and how many were killed by protesters. I lost count in all the confusion. I wonder how all those hundreds of thousands of family members of dead Ukrainians feel about Biden pre-pardoning his entire crime family to cover up the grifting they did to line their pockets at Ukrainian expense. This feels like “whataboutism”. Biden’s pardons can be wrong and Trump’s pardons can be wrong. “Whataboutism: is a term invented by the butthurt “liberals” in an attempt to make Trump out as the worst president evah. It’s a term I reject. I much prefer the term “context”, which is information needed in order to have an informed opinion. In my informed opinion, Biden’s pardons, including the non-pardon of Leonard Peltier (he deserved a real pardon, not the half-assed “pardon” he got), are wrong. While I don’t know the details of every single Jan 6th case, from what I do know of them, those pardons were the right thing to do. Participating in a protest that turned into a riot that disrupted a procedural vote for a couple hours doesn’t warrant serious jail time or a black mark on anyone’s record. I won’t even get into the fact that the capitol police let many of the protesters in, or how many spooks were in the crowd that day. The butthurt is at a fever pitch right now, and their tolerance is very low. They are incapable of informed opinions – all they feel is hate. They hate Trump, the people around him, and the people who voted for him. They are the scoundrels that did this to them and they want revenge. Even death, and yes, I have read that about some of the J6 people (death instead of pardons). It’s going to be a long 4 years. On fb I’m a member of a “city X before and after” photograph group. 22k members. It’s a neat group. Today the founder went off the rails about Trump and the J6 pardons. Went ballistic, irrational, completely unhinged. He totally blew the group up. Some people agreed with him and posted unhinged stuff as well. If this is what is going on with people…not a good sign. I screenshotted it. I’ll save you guys from the words used. Lots of familyblog. I have a similar thing too. They are at fever pitch hate level, and it’s getting very nasty. You are either like them, or you are the enemy. There is no middle ground – none. Absolutely what you said, Screwball. That is what that guy’s post was-all of what you said. Watch the video of the incident commander of the Capitol Police shooting an unarmed Woman to death, Ashli Babbitt. One of the curious things about that shooting was the two Capitol cops standing by while rioters smashed the class partitions on either side of the door they were guarding. Ms Babbitt crawled through one of those openings while the cops did nothing.It was t was murder in the 2nd degree, at NO POINT did Ms Babbitt pose a threat of death or serious bodily injury to anyone. Let me repeat, the cop who shot her dead was in charge of the Capitol police response that day. He committed murder on camera, in front of numerous witnesses and he has not been charged for that crime. I watched that incident. I also saw him warning her as she and a small group were breaking down a barrier in the capital building. I wonder how the response would be seen if the president was behind that barrier and a small group were breaking d9en the door to get to them. You can reject whatever terms you want, but if you disagree that Trump’s pardons were wrong (I don’t really know enough to have a strong opinion), then disagree on the basis of those facts not on the basis of something a different president did. Hmmm . . . is beating up police officers not a crime if it is in what you consider a good cause? More than 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or obstructing law enforcement, including around 175 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer, including with batons, planks, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bearer or pepper spray. Several were convicted of seditious conspiracy. If let’s say BLM protesters, or climate protesters had done a fraction of that, many of the Capitol rioters would probably be among those calling for them to be shipped to Gitmo. Thin blue line flag at the Capitol riot Some of the charges C’mon – it’s pretty clear they increased the charges to send a message and most should have been at worst charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor. So write them a ticket and be done with it. And BLM protesters did do a fraction of that, and I don’t think they should go to prison either. I’m still a fan of that 1st amendment thing and try to be consistent. I can’t speak for the hypothetical MAGAs out there, who increasingly seem to me to be a caricature created by scared “liberals”. I didn’t vote for Trump, but I know plenty of people who did, and not many fit the stereotype the media would have you believe. Plenty of photographic evidence and sworn testimony of what happened was provided to judges and juries. We can all have opinions as to whether the cause of the protesters was just or their tactics justified, but what happened wasn’t only trespass. The three judges mentioned in the second link were appointed by Obama, GWB, and Reagan respectively. https://whyy.org/articles/january-6-crimes-trump-court-cases-evidence/ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/capitol-rioters-severe-sentences-reprimands-judges Conspiracy is an inchoate offence. Nothing happened. You should smell.a rat It is used by states to charge dissenters with “precrime”. There is very rarely a criminal conspiracy in which a mastermind is directing others. In the US these get charged with wire offences. In the UK, they get charged with financial offences. Conspiracy charges are nearly always political or ” we don’t like the way you people look/talk/act” cases. You can dress up the thinnest tissue of behaviour by two or more people into a plan to bring down the state and a major indictment when the biggest choate crime on the facts might be a parking misdemeanour They increased the charges and used collective responsibility on a disorganised mass. This is what usually happens when cops riot, those who got their scull bashed gets prosecuted for being so threatening that the cops had to riot. Cops in turn tend to riot when control is slipping. And the courts tend to have their back. The unusual thing here is that the cops hardly rioted and that the target is on the right. Otherwise it follows the basic model, which tend to apply no matter the form of government or formal rights to speech or assembly. If real power is threatened niceties goes out the window. I guess it’s all about the exception and who gets to decide the exception. The Associated Press has an interactive web page, Track the legal paths of those arrested in the Jan. 6/Capitol riots that goes into detail about the individuals involved, what they were charged with, their sentences, their states of residence and any group affiliations that they have. Charges: 674 – Illegal parading 520 – Disorderly conduct 350 – Entering restricted area 238 – Assault 180 – Obstructing official proceeding 86 – Physical violence 57 – Theft/Destruction of property 18 – Conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding 14 – Seditious conspiracy 8 – Tampering with documents/proceedings 5 – Firearms charge 4 – Obstructing justice 4 – Communicating threats 3 – Obstructing officers 2 – Robbery Sentences: 1107 – Restitution 1044 – Probation/Supervised release 717 – Imprisonment 464 – Community service 297 – Fine 251 – Home confinement Of the 1,573 people charge, most were not a part of any organized group: Affiliations: 73 – Proud Boys 32 – Oath Keepers 27 – Three Percenters I wonder what the family of Ashley Bobbitt feels about the J6 committee being pardoned wholesale. How was the shooting of someone breaking down barred doors in the capital building and warned before being shot unjustified? Which government building should protesters be allowed to break down doors in? Copagandist. Trespassing in a public space is death sentence for ya, Kurt? Lovely. Having seen how many tear gas projectiles the police fired into peaceful protesters, I think most of the police involved and their families are deeply grateful to former President Biden for his last second pardons, immunizing them from perjury charges for their testimonies before the J6 Committee and in DC courts where they were allowed to testify even if there was no proof a defendant had been anywhere near that officer (raindrop theory). The true J6 story will make Watergate look like a third rate burglary. I know many are not a fan of Tucker Carlson, me included, but his interview with the Capital Police guy was quite telling. Tucker did a nice job and shut his mouth for the most part. Raindrop theory expanded: “When we are all guilty, we will have democracy.” —Albert Camus Zero people, excluding Mrs. Babbit (a protester) were killed that day. She was killed by a policeman with a very bad history of gun use. No police were killed. A few had minor injuries, mostly pepper spray. One cop died a few days later, of a heart attack. Read less fake news (unless you were being sarcastic). Re: “raindrop” theory of prosecution/J6 defendants I am constantly amazed at how liberals fail to understand that when you attack and abuse the law, it will be used against you by the other side in the future. So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window. Thanks Kollar-Ketelly, you’ve just given right-wing prosecutors a new tool to suppress freedom of expression. So at the next BLM/Occupy protest, some poor schmoe who holds a sign up peacefully can now be arrested for the crimes committed by the other dude who throws a rock through a store window. Mission accomplished! Yes, how silly of me to think that either side of the bench has any goal besides destroying freedom of speech and expression. Thanks for correcting me. Chris, Welcome to the exciting world of direct action. You’ve clearly never been to any demonstration where police were released to beat up on participants (on the other hand, the startlingly few participants who dare to beat up on police or counter-demonstrators, even in self-defense, tend to die while resisting arrest). Raindrop theory is already routine. January 6th was the just the first time I’m aware of that it’s been applied to proto-fascist demonstrators in the United States. You also haven’t been tracking largely successful energy industry efforts to automatically deem anyone opposing them as terrorists, a practice that Trump will soon be expanding to anyone he doesn’t like and their families and friends. We are about to discover that “free” in TrumpWorld is a NewSpeak term, quite different from “free” as conventionally defined in any dictionary. It will be interesting to see how long it takes people to realize that they’ve been had. Again. Those weren’t raindrops in the GFC. And of course blac blockers will throw that brick and rock in hopes of getting every poor schmoe arrested and maybe gassed and beaten and then maybe prosecuted . . . in order to radicalize them all and maybe recruit them into the blac block. Depend upon that, too. Would it be fair to say his outstretched arm was elongated? Elon-gated…almost missed that! Brilliant! Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly… A Nazi to her very core. Loves her secret laws and secret rulings. I never see photos of Davosians skiing, why’s that? Maybe they just don’t do it. Gives them too much of that Louis XVI feeling. Piste de la resistance? Shouldn’t that be Axial de Resistance? “Did you see that?” “Yes, I did. She turned on a euro!” “Amazing.” The ghost of Sonny Bono wants a word … Weather foecast the day Bono ate it… Cloudy in the morning, Sonny in the trees in the afternoon. Poikilotherms, all of them It’s for other people to bend ze knees? Actually, it is funny you don’t see them skiing because they are always using the poles and looking for new moguls. they all feverishly watched the pink panther movie and thought it was historically accurate. That’s because all we have in the way of physical samples of the Davosonians are a finger bone and some pocket protectors. The conspiratorially inclined will be certain to become very verklempt over the original source of the evidence of the Davosonians; some obscure cave in central Russia. “Neo-Nazis Love the Nazi-Like Salutes Elon Musk Made at Trump’s Inauguration” I made no immediate assumptions about Elon’s hand gesture because that is how I act in these days of automatic information. I said the same thing to myself, the hand on the heart first, I have never seen it. But I saw the same video as you of the neo-nazi’s saluting, and now I need to default that he holds their views unless he states otherwise. It convinced me. This, to me, is not something to be on the sidelines about. I know you need Twitter for a= much of your reporting here, but I wonder if there is something to be done about it. Things may be about to change and maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, I use a service called xcancel to look at Twitter. Not trying to be a jerk. Please look at any number of photos of public figures doing the same thing that are now circulating all over the Internet. Including Kamala Harris. I will point out it was the ADL themselves who wrote a Tweet last night basically saying “not so fast – we should focus on things that are actually anti-Semitic”. I am of the mind that if anyone should be able to opine about this it would be them. Every Holocaust survivor patient I have ever had has been in their group. I am certain they would be able to recognize a real Nazi salute. My Jewish colleagues today in the lounge were just shaking their head in disbelief that AOC et al would be making an issue out of this. There are lots of things I do not like about Musk. As has been usual the past 10 years or so, all of this kind of performative bullshit just completely takes the attention away from the real issues. I think the woke need to grow a pair. Musk is clearly not a politician nor is he someone who is really comfortable in the limelight. I myself do not get nervous at all in front of students. In front of strangers I turn into Jello – and I have videos of myself through life doing all kinds of awkward things in public speeches. Your skirt is hiked up a bit, and your bias is showing. That is a personal attack and utterly out of line. IM Doc lives in a deep blue enclave and is reporting on what patients and colleagues are telling him. If they are not buying the Musk gesture hysteria and you are, the problem is YOU. There are plenty of things to be worked up about re Musk, and this or should be low on the list if you were paying attention. Start with DOGE, FFS. And you will have no more return here. I thought AOC was being idiotic too. What gets me is the hand-on-heart gesture. It seemed to me dispositive that Musk was “giving his heart” with that gesture (and Musk is, I said especially herky jerky in his motions just now, so the stiff arm arm didn’t bother me. But now, given that video, where the hand-on-heart movement, which is not part of the Roman salute at all, is part of the whole gesture, it looks to me like two populations caught the same variant. And I really dislike coming to that conclusion, because I hate that way of thinking. Adding, I’ll keep track of that video, let’s see what others say. It might have been a poor attempt at something like Steph Curry’s gesture. Musk is getting increasingly nuttier, but I don’t think he’s whacko enough to start giving the HH to large crowds in front of lots of cameras. I could be wrong. The Ukrainians all think he’s on their side now. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881753775289077818#m Also, not Musk but too funny to pass up, Trump allegedly trolling Hispanophone America. https://nitter.poast.org/MyLordBebo/status/1881791991677137342#m It could have the Techbro’s version of the Romulan ‘salute’ from the Star Trek program. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxnqqQLVTI&ab_channel=WickyWoo The Romulans didn’t do the outstretched hand, did they? I think it is more similar to the “Terran salute” from the mirror universe. Which is of course just a nazi salute. It is kind of wild to me to see the machinations people are going through to not see the obvious. The specifics of the sieg heil (was the hand laid flat on the chest, or held perpendicular to it?) is entirely besides the point. So he Americanized it a bit by adding a “hand over heart” a la the Pledge of Alliegance…and? That was a sieg heil, he did it twice, clear as day. Everyone downplaying it feels to me exactly like everyone trying to say Biden was fine, actually, after the debate. Bruh, we all saw it with our own eyes. No one does that by accident. And it also looked to me like he was coked or methed up pretty good, but I guess when you wrap up with a good ol’ fascist salute everything else kinda gets forgotten. Here is Musk in parallell with the original nazi salute. The arm moves in a simliar fashion, but Musks is a bit more forceful, while the original German is more stiff. Here is American history X with a neo-nazi salute. The neo-nazi, US version, is more forceful then the original and very similar to what Musk is doing. In other words: Musk did a nazi salute. Twice. While proclaiming that Trump voters had saved civilization. None of us can know what goes on in another persons head. But most people go their whole lifes while not doing a nazi salute in public, even once. I find it unlikely that Musk didn’t know what he was doing. About as unlikely as all those Ukrainians just happen to use symbols that are very similar to nazi symbols. Here’s a gif with Elon and Skinheads (the bad kind) side-by-side. It’s an exact match. https://discuss.smash.today/@SmashToday/113873210813104675 Those guys on the left look like undercover state agents provocateurs. Then again, so does the guy on the right. What else is AOC going to talk about now that she’s decided Pelosi is “Mama Bear”? Selling out limits your options. Amen, to your second sentence. Imo. Woke is the same kind of busybody collection for liberals that the Moral Majority busybody collection was for conservatives back in the day: Social authoritarianism disguised as do-gooderism. ‘Believe what I believe or else.’ The spirit of Mrs. Grundy lives! Casting Musk’s ‘heart-felt’ salute as ‘Nazi’ helps to further tar AFD with the same brush. As it should. AfD is fascist. Full stop. So are most ruling parties in the EU/NATO. I take disagreements with compassion. The photos you are referring too are photos, but with Musk, it was a video. And he did not do it once, but twice. Mostly I am just saying it is not as certain as it was when I first saw the video. The ADL thinks anti-zionism is anti-semitism, so I cannot take their opinion seriously. But the ADL criticized AfD saying: AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi Martin Sellner, who discussed a mass deportation plan for foreigners and “non-assimilated” Germans, as part of AfD’s strategy should it be elected to govern Germany. Musk expressed support of the AfD. I would not support the AfD. And the only real response Musk gave was: “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” But no on is calling him Hitler, they are calling him a neo-nazi. I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempest, but I am airing on the side of extreme caution here. “I can see that he might have done it on purpose to stir up this very tempes” I think it almost certainly is that. To me it looked a bit off (hand angled a little high), like he was either trying to make a Nazi salute and failing or making a gesture guaranteed to be taken for a Nazi salute with a slight deviation for the sake of deniability. Then again, looking at old photos of actual Nazi salutes, it’s not like they always held their hands in exactly the same way, so maybe it fits. What I find truly unlikely, though, is that someone like Musk would be able to hold consistently to a demanding ideology like Nazism for any amount of time. What I find extremely likely is that someone like Musk would make a pathetically successful attempt to stir up a controversy by violating widespread taboos and trolling the left. As far as I could tell, it’s one of his favourite activities. Ideologies are for plebs. Insanely rich ego-maniacs only worship themselves. I’m not sure the even he knew why he did it. Maybe he felt that he is now on top of the world, like some modern day Roman Emperor. Avē Caesar! Be careful Doc, I wouldn’t get too comfortable with the ADL’s efforts to point out “real” antisemitism. My take is that they were encouraging people to back off on the Musk salute only to make a larger point about antisemitism, not to actually dial it back to a sensible level. The ADL makes it clear throughout their website that they support a broad definition of antisemitism, including boycotts against the Israeli state and comparison to apartheid and nazi regimes. Musk says he’s on the Asperger spectrum. That means he lacks “social skills”. I.e. he can’t figure out how normies will misinterpret what he does. Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old, and people don’t take that into account and think he’s the next incarnation of Hitler? I sometimes wish I could send people here to totalitarian states so that they learn what totalitarianism is once and for all, and realize they don’t live in one. Six month school exchanges with North Korea might finally knock some sense into them. “Here he is, a 50 year old man prancing around like a giddy 10 year old” Sounds like just the right person to be advising Trump. I disagree. You can be socially skilled and very stupid. Witness many politicians… Boris Johnson, Macron & Sarkozy come to my mind, but I’m sure everyone else has their own version. You can also be socially awkward and very intelligent. Witness many mathematicians, scientists and engineers, eg Einstein, Newton, Tesla, Turing, Feynman, Nash, Faraday, Pascal, Mendel, Schrödinger… etc. I think Musk falls into the latter category. As such, he might be useful advising on tech matters. I’m not sure what he’ll do with DOGE. It could be a disaster, but on the other hand Twitter still works despite his firing of tons of employees, so he knew what to cut. Time will tell. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Also, about 30% of the time, I just get stuck in a loop for days where the login page will just wrap around on itself and not let me log in. The functionality ain’t what it used to be. Does Twitter still work despite the firings? I can’t see replies or full threads anymore if I’m not logged in, and that was a big part of the site. Unfortunately, I think that’s a commercial decision (aka enshitiffication) to force people to log in. Twitter downtime is down (Twitter whales). No idea about your login issue. I have no idea what makes you place Musk into the same category as Einstein, et al. He has failed to demonstrate his genius, is not an engineer, and routinely confuses ideas he stole from others as his own. His claim of being on the spectrum is pure BS. He’s a conman and a grifter, not a real world Tony Stark / Iron Man. The category is intelligent but socially awkward people. Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself. Name me someone else who developed the level of self-driving that Tesla has. Sure, he relies on engineers to help do this, but he has made major decisions about it. So did Edison. If you don’t think that requires intelligence, why don’t you do it? Name me someone else who developed reusable rockets. AFAIK he did quite a bit of the work on that himself. McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X ? Interesting, thanks. I learned something. To be fair though, it was a prototype that never reached space, rather than a production vehicle launching satellites. Apparently Musk said “the SpaceX Falcon 9 development was “… continuing the great work of the DC-X project”. To be fair, Musk is still failing to make much headway with Starship. Multiple failures yet no stable low Earth orbit tests. Getting the rocket booster back sometimes, but frequently losing the main flight stage hardly makes it much better than the DC-X. Feel free to point to one thing Musk developed himself, instead of buying, that was successful. He’s bought everything he’s ever sold. It’s not intelligence, it’s money! Because I don’t have the money. Intelligence has nothing to do with it. LOL, you are actually dismissing engineers as some irrelevant factor in engineering. Like they are janitors, or maybe nurses wiping sweat of a surgeon performing open heart surgery. As an engineer, I almost feel personally insulted. Those guys are the ones doing all the work that you are supposedly praising here (the rocket science stuff), and I bet you can’t name a single one of them (or any real rocket scientist for that matter). Instead, you are worshiping the CEO celebrity guy. What Edison did was cheating and stealing, and also killing animals in public for marketing reasons. I bet you love him too. I’m an engineer too, and I’m quite aware that without a company in which one can develop cool stuff, what one does doesn’t get anywhere. That company is a machine too, and that’s what Elon builds. But let’s just ignore that, and pretend he just bought it all, and is dumb. Just ask yourself, if he had supported the people you like, would you be singing the same tune? What people I like? I don’t like people at all. Why would I pretend stuff? I feel like you and I live in two different universes. How about we just ignore that I tried to establish inter-universe communication. Your last sentence gives an explanation for the first one. He’s a conman and a grifter, and an essential part of it is to make people place Musk into the same category as Einstein. In real life, his placement is different, but some people are more inclined to belive his words than their own lying eyes. https://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1881541689585852882 ADL is not an authority on fascism. Hitler’s most infamous demon of choice was Jews (as opposed to, say, Mexicans or Haitians or Palestinians), something that even fellow-fascists like Mussolini never took seriously at the time. Hitler worshippers are fascists. But not all fascists worship Hitler. Don’t believe someone is a Nazi until the ADL deny it. When fascism comes to America, it will come in the guise of anti-antisemitism. Musk is clearly a man of the radical right, not just a typical libertarian (Koch type) or evangelical Christian billionaire. A normal billionaire is content to buy influence and stay behind the scenes. Musk has become an ideological warrior. He likes warring and it has pushed him into some truly weird rightwing subcultures. He’s also on who knows what substances. ADL said that AZOV are not Nazis too. https://thegrayzone.com/2022/12/08/adl-ukraines-azov-battalion-far-right/ ADL is nothing more that an attack dog for those that do not stay in line (by playing insta-win anti-Semitic card), and guard for those that are part of their gang (which Azov, and Musk, demonstratively are). I wonder if your Jewish colleagues think that there are no Nazis in Ukraine. People using ADL, or “Jewish people they met”, as a reference for anything is not even funny anymore. This whole incident is not about Musk, but about the whole US public discourse. I saw one of those still photos of Kamala Harris. Then I saw this little video bit which that still photo was artfully extracted from. Here is the video bit. https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1i6szwa/context_for_those_sharing_kamala_still_images/ I wonder how many of those any number of other photos of public figures doing the same thing were also artfully extracted from videos showing them doing no such thing at all. Clevery extracted by complete-bad-faith-based clever extracters and sight-biters. And I wonder how many fake photoshop “pictures” will follow along, pretending to show nazi salutes from various public figures. > maybe more news will move off of Twitter now? I hope so, As of today there is nothing of equivalent scale or scope, both for breaking stories, Covid, and various vertical “neighborhoods,” certainly not Threads or Bluesky. What would be ideal is the rejuvenation of the blogosphere. Thanks to Kneecap I now read a lot of Irish reddit sub’s. They are all chock full of posts demanding that X links be banned (screenshots allowed by the more permissive). This is the cynical, tolerant Irish. These people need help! This ban twitter links thing is spreading to lots of other subs right now like a wildfire. Heavens! Good thing no one is talking about apparent banking irregularities.

See ChrisFromGA’s comment at 2:29 above 8 inches of snow in Lafayette Louisiana! None here oddly. Maybe it’s too cold. We just missed out, downtown Atlanta and Athens are getting a decent burst of snow, but in the northern burbs, we got nothing! What they are saying in Canada: https://xcancel.com/MadelnCanada/status/1881777506564636781#m Yikes, and also a Yowza. Yeah no climate change could explain that phenomenon…as for the big Houston metro, I can recall that region getting blasted with frigid, sub freezing cold about this time four years ago….much to the shock and chagrin of the authorities that oversee the grid and related infrastructure….wonder if any subsequent updates by oh, ERCOT were ever complete ( that is to say or suggest, they talk a lot at length about reviews but they stop at only words, no action )… Recalling as well, this massive pile up of vehicles on I 35 in Ft Worth was an all timer. https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/ntsb-releases-factual-report-2021-133-car-pileup-crash-i-35w/287-a8d2543f-9848-493d-b461-d6a278613c55 Funny ” TV screen typo” that went out over at least some air . . . https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i6j05f/no_fucking_way/ Zeitgeist Watch-What women want article. I heard this from a couple of unrelated young women (mid-20’s?) and it really bothered me since I can only imagine myself saying it in very limited circumstances. This article gave me a hint of why. Is this a thing? *giggle..”I’m just a girl! ” giggle* First was a waitress when asked a question about cars during our conversation about my kid putting his car in a ditch. The implication was that she can’t know anything about cars because she’s just a girl. The second was an over heard social conversation at work between male and female co-workers, both in their 20’s and the young lady’s phrasing and intonation were identical to the waitress. I’m almost 60 so I’m totally out of touch. Was this the intonation? If so, it’s just a self-deprecating pop-culture reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftde81QNXDY It was close to this…I hope that is all it is. Oh man i actually have read a lot of pieces on the self infantilization of women in their 20s. Girl dinner, 24 year old teenage girl, etc. stuffed animals being popular among grown women, the design of products being increasingly infantile. Also how “stay at home girlfriends” are becoming popular on tiktok. moving in an opposite direction from the 2010s girlboss feminism. Defenders generally go “well i deserve some comfort and in this modern world you are deprived of traditional aging markers like buying a house and starting a family because the economy. It is more fun to watch tv shows and try and marry a finance bro.” Antis generally go “you are letting go of your own agency.” I have seen this topic debated so much. Can link articles if anybody wants to hear more. I wonder how much of it is anime-manga culture. I don’t discount the influence of kiddie porn. Just spitballin’…. Ruy Teixeira evidently inhabits an alternate universe — one where Biden was too progressive. Evidence? From where I sit he was the desperation candidate to prevent Bernie from winning the nomination in 2019: recall the other candidates — with the exception of Warren, who was the nearest to Bernie’s right— all magically dropping out just before South Carolina. Coincidence? Hardly. And when he won in 2020 the donor class found him usefully malleable, so they hung onto his increasingly obvious cognitively decayed carcass like grim death until the debate exposed the charade. Too progressive? What a bad joke … Ruy Teixeira’s account of 2020 completely omits Obama’s involvement in selecting Biden. He then goes on to cite Third Way. I had some hope that he was’t a sleazy opportunist. Fat chance! About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025. It seems to me that’s the kind of task that LLMs like Claude have been designed for. I’d volunteer for a working group, but it would help to have people with a background in the subject matter to fine-tune the prompting. About the executive orders — wondering if anyone has considered using AI to analyze them – especially for the comparison against Project 2025… [ Excellent. This is precisely the sort of analysis that a proper AI system is meant for. ] A different perspective from the one you suggest but here are some takes on AI and copy-paste in the EO’s. https://bsky.app/profile/mjsdc.bsky.social/post/3lg7uvbogds27 https://bsky.app/profile/rmfifthcircuit.bsky.social/post/3lg7t4h4n6c22 Generative AI seems like overkill, unreliable, and it has quite a bad track record of “hallucinating” citations. This is just basic textual analysis. If you want to use an app, you could put all the documents into a single folder and start searching for set phrases using double quotes. On macOS, you can easily do this with the Finder, and even create compound searches. If there’s any duplication or copy-and-paste between Project 2025 and the EOs, you’ll find it soon enough. P.S., Yves has spoken out against citing AI apps as sources here, and I agree that’s a sound policy. Mask tweet Threadreader here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1880437952729518482.html Thank you! About the Gulf-of-Mexico coast blizzard being a once in a lifetime event . . . I don’t think so. As man-made global heatering keeps destabilizing the atmosphere and the jet streams, I expect more random and deeper-reaching herniated polar vortexes here and there than what we used to have. That means storm events “like” this every few years or so. More zuds in Mongolia ( https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146422 ) more blizzards in the Gulf of MexiComerica, etc. This is an opportunity for all the California-sympathetic Senators and Representatives to keep careful note of which Senators and Representatives vote against fire disaster relief for California, so they can vote against disaster relief when the Senators and Representatives from those states or districts want some post-disaster relief assistance for their states or districts. I don’t suppose that this is going to delay all those LNG shipments to the EU as the EU has left themselves on the hook for needing them now. No, it certainly won’t. And after global warming has advanced enough to cancel the Gulf Stream and turn EUrope into a localized super-cold zone every winter, they will buy even more mucher morer LNG than now. Profits! I’m of the opinion that much of the truly weird weather is on account of Hunga Tonga blowing up real good in 2022-combined with climate change. Clowns like Johnson making conditions for California will come back to bite him when push>meets<shove in his back yard. Only if California and others MAKE it come back to bite Johnson in the back yard. In fact, if all the delegations opposed to Johnson’s MAGA behavior here want to, they will promise ahead of time to vote against any relief for the South from this weather unless and until no-conditions relief for California has been voted through and signed by President Musk(trump). They could even try forcing these two separate disaster areas to be part of one relief bill. No conditions or no relief. Its what I’d do. How many years will it take for the Hunga Tonga Hunga water-blast to fall back out of the atmosphere? However many years that is, we can then see what the weird weather levels are after that. A natural experiment has been performed. Think you mean the Gulf of America–need to stay up to date. https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-gulf-of-mexico.html He’s really into Nikki Haley territory now. When she became governor she required all state employees to answer the phone “it’s a great day in South Carolina.” No .. . I think I’ll stay behind the times. Its still Gulf of Mexico to me. But that will be one of the Trumpies’ linguistic loyalty tests. If one of them overhears you calling it ” Gulf of Mexico”, they’ll put you on a little list. Here is an entry called ” Context for those sharing Kamala still images, this is not what Elon did”. https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1i6szwa/context_for_those_sharing_kamala_still_images/ But the muskbara for Musk will continue until/unless it becomes too untenable from sheer embarrassment-o-genesis. “The Lost Towers of the Guelph-Ghibelline Wars” It’s a bizarre story but a fascinating one. Maybe our own wealthy could just occupy Manhattan and fortify that island for themselves. Each family could buy their own skyscraper and fortify it. Dibs on the Chrysler tower. It could be like J.G. Ballard’s High Rise meets Poe’s Masque of the Red Death meets the Kowloon Walled City. It would be interesting to read a summary of what the revoked executive actions said. From perusing their titles, and not the actual text, there’s some DEI stuff, some environmental safeguards, some AI safety stuff, some Palestinian stuff, and some COVID stuff… They are now returning 404’s so you have to find them in archive.org or archive.is.

Title: As Trump Takes the Wheel, Big Corporations Extricate From DEI, Climate Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024.

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ...

President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Title: Apple won't return TikTok to the App Store until it's sold to a U.S. buyer

AAPL: 223.18 ( +0.54 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. TikTok's status in the U.S. remains complicated Despite President Trump's temporary stay on the federal TikTok ban, it's extremely unlikely that the video-sharing app will return to the App Store anytime soon. Here's why. On January 19, the U.S. government enacted a blanket ban against ByteDance apps, owners of popular apps such as TikTok, Marvel Snap, and CapCut. A day later, President Trump signed an executive order delaying the ban for 75 days. And yet, despite that, TikTok — or any app developed by ByteDance Ltd — has yet to reappear on the App Store or the Google Play store. And, according to a new Apple support page, it appears as if it's going to stay that way. Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.The complete list of removed apps includes: CapCut Gauth: AI Study Companion Hypic Lark - Rooms Display Lark - Team Collaboration Lark Rooms Controller Lemon8 MARVEL SNAP TikTok TikTok Shop Seller Center TikTok StudioThose who live in the United States and already have any of the aforementioned apps on their phones will still be able to access them. However, they can't be redownloaded if deleted or restored to a new device. Additionally, in-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible. This comes as the newest chapter in the fray between the United States and ByteDance that began in mid-2020, under the Trump administration. For the next few years, notably the first of President Biden's administration, it seemed as though the TikTok ban was off the table. Then, in April 2024, President Biden signed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok ownership to a U.S. buyer within nine months. ByteDance, for its part, went on record saying that it would rather shut down TikTok than divest to a U.S. company. Days before the ban was set to take effect, then President-Elect Trump promised Americans TikTok would continue operating in the U.S. After the ban took effect on January 19, Trump kept his promise. He delayed the ban on January 20, the day he took office. The delay was enacted under the pretense that ByteDance would have an additional 75 days to divest ownership to a U.S. business. There's currently no word if there's been any movement on the divesture front. The move to acquire TikTok is reminiscent of eminent domain, or the process of the government acquiring private property for public use provided it fairly compensates the original owner. However, because the only requirement is that ByteDance divests to a U.S.-based owner, who would likely retain it as private property, it does not meet the criteria. While ByteDance was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, China does not own a majority stake in the company. As TikTok points out, Nearly 60% of TikTok is owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, while its founders and global employees own 20% each.

Title: Blackrock Clinic seeks to open women’s health facility in city centre

The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. In plans lodged with Dublin City Council in recent days, the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is seeking planning permission to change the use of an office development to a women’s health centre at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2. A planning report lodged with the application said that the proposed development for a women’s health centre aligned with priorities, outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-2025, such as improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care and preventive health services such as mammograms and bone density scans. [ Blackrock Clinic gets go-ahead for expansion plansOpens in new window ] The report, by McGill Planning, said that “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the action plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, planning consultant Shauna Hewitt said that “repurposing the existing office building minimises environmental impact and aligns with sustainable practices, an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. Ms Hewitt added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centered design, this transformation into a women’s health centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. She said that “the proposed women’s health centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location”. “We trust this development will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland,” she said. [ All women will receive same level of allowance for post-mastectomy and hair loss products after cancer treatmentOpens in new window ] The report also said that the proposed centre was “strategically located to integrate seamlessly into Dublin’s existing network of women’s healthcare facilities”. “Its proximity to key institutions such as the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street and nearby specialised clinics ensures it is well-positioned to complement public healthcare services,” the report said. A decision is due on the application in March.

Title: China's Vice Premier lunches with Dimon, Schwarzman and other Davos financiers

By Julie Zhu and Elisa Martinuzzi DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang met with global finance and business leaders including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon during a private lunch in Davos on Tuesday. The lunch, hosted by World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab, was also attended by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters and Visa (NYSE:V) CEO Ryan Mclnerney. Several Chinese government officials who are part of the country's delegation in Switzerland were also present at the event. U.S. financial firms have been keen to maintain good relations with Beijing, even as Chinese growth has waned. "All the indicators are positive, but the market is waiting to see how much conviction there is and how much follows through," an executive who attended the meeting told Reuters. "There was a determination to complete all the transformations that they (the Chinese) set out," said the executive, adding the key goals for Beijing include stabilizing the property market and stimulating the domestic demand. Chinese policymakers are intensifying efforts to stimulate a faltering economy in the face of concerns over potential U.S. tariff hikes following President Donald Trump's inauguration. Trump unexpectedly held off from imposing tariffs on China on his first day back in the White House. Ding on Tuesday welcomed more investment by foreign companies in the country, adding that China was willing to solve problems encountered by domestic and foreign firms. He is the second-highest-ranking Chinese official to rub shoulders with global business and political leaders at the Davos summit since President Xi Jinping attended in 2017.

Title: USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Acquires Hashnote, a $1.3B Tokenized RWA Firm
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/21/circle-enters-tokenization-race-by-acquiring-hashnote-usd1-3b-real-world-asset-issuer

Circle, the crypto company behind the $48 billion USDC stablecoin, said Tuesday it has acquired tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer Hashnote. The companies closed the deal this morning, a Circle spokesperson told CoinDesk and was announced in Davos, Switzerland during the annual World Economic Forum meeting. The companies didn't reveal pricing details. Circle aims to integrate USYC with USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, enabling convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains, the press release said. Hashnote issues the $1.3 billion USYC token, which saw massive growth last year to become the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury product on the market, according to rwa.xyz data. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said this marks a significant step toward aligning traditional financial structures with the speed and transparency of blockchain-based markets. "This is a huge unlock for a market that is increasingly being driven by institutional adoption, and where participants increasingly expect market structures that are common in TradFi,” Allaire said. Circle shared plans a year ago to go public, and the crypto industry widely expects the public share offering to happen later this year. The acquisition underscores the synergies between two of the hottest trends in crypto: stablecoins and tokenization. Circle's main stablecoin competitor Tether launched a tokenization platform last year. Stablecoins, a $200 billion asset class of cryptocurrencies with prices pegged predominantly to the U.S. dollar, are a crucial piece of infrastructure in tokenization efforts. They are used as a bridge between fiat money and digital assets and widely used for settling transactions on blockchain rails. Tokenized RWAs like treasury bills and money market funds are quickly gaining traction among sophisticated investors and asset managers as collateral for trading. Unlike in traditional markets, blockchain-based assets promise transparency, accessibility and around-the-clock settlements. Treasury-backed tokens also allow investors to earn a yield while posted as collateral or margin for trades, enhancing returns compared to trades collateralized with fiat money or stablecoins. For example, Singapore-based hedge fund QCP Capital earlier in January executed a bitcoin (BTC) basis trade using BUIDL, the money market fund token issued by BlackRock and Securitize. Circle also announced that it struck a deal with Cumberland, a DRW-affiliated crypto trading firm and market maker, to provide liquidity and facilitate settlements for USDC and USYC. The partnership aims to expand USYC as a form of collateral on exchanges and custodial platforms. Additionally, Circle laid out plans to deploy USDC on the Canton Network, a blockchain used by traditional financial institutions for real-world asset transactions. The integration with Canton would allow for constant liquidity between cash and collateral and allows seamless transfers between decentralized and traditional markets.

Title: Circle acquires Hashnote, which just overtook BlackRock in tokenized money market funds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The U.S. money market industry is worth around $7 trillion and, according to stablecoin giant Circle, a growing portion of that will move to the blockchain. That's why the company has decided to acquire a fast-growing crypto startup called Hashnote, which operates a tokenized money market fund that controls around $1.5 billion in assets—Ethereum. It could also provide broader strategic advantages to Circle at a crucial time for the company. Founded in 2013, Circle and its founding CEO Jeremy Allaire have long been fixtures of the crypto scene, but have experienced dramatic ups and downs. Most recently, after the company's flagship USDC lost significant market share after a series of crises in the latest "crypto winter" of 2022-2023, the company has been flying high during the current rally. In early 2024, Circle filed an S-1—the form that firms file with the Securities and Exchange Commission when they are seeking to go public. In a common practice, however, the company filed the form confidentially and has yet to provide updates on its specific plans or timing. Circle's IPO plans are likely to benefit from recent growth. That includes the market cap of Circle's USDC—on which it collects interest with its partner Coinbase—expanding to nearly $50 billion. Circle is also likely to benefit from a new pro-crypto climate in Washington, DC where a Republican Congress is preparing to move forward with long-awaited legislation to make stablecoins mainstream. The acquisition of Hashnote, meanwhile, gives Circle a bigger presence in the world of DeFi. In announcing the deal, the company also noted it has entered a strategic partnership with DRW, one of the largest institutional crypto traders via its subsidiary Cumberland. In addition, Circle announced it is deploying USDC on Canton, a blockchain popular with major traditional banks, trading firms, asset managers and exchanges. A final aspect of the Hashnote deal worth noting is that it means Circle will, through USYC, be offering a yield bearing asset for the first time since 2021, when regulatory pressure forced the company to shelve its own offering. This could provide a strategic advantage at a time when a host of new players –including fintech giants PayPal and Robinhood—are vying for a share of the stablecoin market, and promising to provide holders of their tokens with yields or other perks beyond what USDC offers.

Title: TikTok bounces back after ban, is it here to stay?

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. On the second day after the ban, and the day before the new president’s inauguration, TikTok became accessible to users again, having effectively been shut down for just 14 hours. The fiasco leaves one big question: will TikTok stay for good? Why it matters: TikTok’s return to operation after its ban, though brief, raises larger questions about its future in the US. As one of the world’s most popular apps, TikTok’s business model, its relationship with global users, and its ownership structure have come under intense scrutiny. The app’s survival hinges on a combination of political maneuvering, legal challenges, and complex dynamics between US and Chinese interests. The app has become a focal point of broader geopolitical tensions, leaving its future anything but assured. Details: After being shut down for about 14 hours, TikTok was revived on Sunday and thanked Trump for assuring TikTok and its business partners that they would not face hefty fines for keeping the app running. The app began operating again on Monday, but TikTok was still unavailable for download in the Apple and Google app stores. Trump also stated on social media platform X that he would sign an order to “save” the software. So, what does saving TikTok entail? Context: The TikTok ban debate in the US stems from national security concerns, driven by allegations that the app could potentially allow the Chinese government to access US user data. In response, then-President Trump signed executive orders aimed at banning the app unless it was sold to a US company. At the beginning of his second term, he made an about-turn to become a proponent of keeping the app, positioning himself as the only person with the potential to put into effect meaningful change.

Title: Thoughts on Thomas Crooks and the Butler Shooting (After the new Tucker Carlson-Sean Davis Interview) - Is "Professor Raoul X" a government subcontractor?

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 7:12:16 AM PST by MtnClimber I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Sean Davis, six months after the near-assassination of Donald Trump. The entire hour and a half is well worth your time, but at least watch the first 15 minutes. Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-79 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Sean Davis, six months after the near-assassination of Donald Trump. The entire hour and a half is well worth your time, but at least watch the first 15 minutes. Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields.

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-79 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-79 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2.

It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs?

But is the overall slow-walking necessary, or part of managing public perceptions and emotions? 3. Government secrecy and manipulation of public perceptions and emotions stimulates conspiracy theories and distrust. Q: Does the government consider public turmoil and confusion a bug or a feature? What struck me from the interview: Crook had a remote detonator to detonate the explosives in his vehicle So he planned to make a melee after the assassination. Most likely part of a getaway plan The detonators were turned off at the car. Someone turned them off. They didn’t want him to live. His handlers/manipulators were on site at Butler at the assassinations attempt. Great Article, thank you. This is an amazing interview. Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles!

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

Business TikTok app with the message "Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now" are seen in this illustration taken, January 19, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration TikTok remained unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the U.S. on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular Chinese-owned short-video app by 75 days. The order came amid growing doubts on the future of the app that went dark on Saturday, shortly before a law that cited national security to say the Chinese owner ByteDance should sell it or face a ban in the U.S. came into effect on Sunday. Although TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, it was yet to return to the app stores. The delay, analysts doubted, could be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app. Apple's App Store said, "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in", while Google Play said, "Downloads for this app are paused due to current US legal requirements". Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. Bill Ford, CEO of TikTok investor General Atlantic, told CNBC on Tuesday there are ways to change TikTok U.S. ownership, that do not necessarily involve its sale. "I don't think that necessarily has to mean a divestiture," he said, referring to the law that bans TikTok, adding that 60 per cent of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, was controlled by non- Chinese shareholders. ByteDance is nearly 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each.

Title: Rare 'planet parade' event to light up Irish skies tonight - here's how to spot them

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A RARE PLANETARY event which involves the alignment of six planets in a row in our solar system will be visible to the naked eye in Irish skies tonight, astronomers have said. The celestial event, also known as a ‘Planet Parade’ or the ‘great planetary alignment’, will see the sky scattered with a number of visible planets – including Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and Neptune will also be visible through a telescope. Resident astronomer for the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio’s News at One that the planets may be visible for an “entire month” in Irish skies. “We are very lucky – we’ll have the planets in the sky basically throughout the month of February,” Wilcox said. Most people in the Northern Hemisphere will be able to see the planets for the next four weeks. “It’s really nice to have the planets in the sky, we don’t always have so many at one time, Wilcox said. “This evening, will have four of the planets visible without a telescope or binoculars – you’ll have Saturn, Venus, Jupiter and Mars all across the sky.” Advertisement Astronomer Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio that the stars will be visible from late this afternoon. “You don’t need to be out super late to see them, you can go out just after sunset and you’ll be able to see four planets without any sort of equipment,” Wilcox said. Planet-gazers are advised to look to the south, where four of the planets will progressively appear. Venus will be the first planet visible, and will be the “brightest object in the sky” after the sun and moon. “Just as the sun is setting down, one of the planets you’ll be able to spot quickly will be Venus. It will be so incredibly bright, you’ll see that one before the stars even come out,” Wilcox explained. “Following this, Saturn will appear right next to Venus in a south-west direction. Then if you turn towards the south and look slightly south-east, you’ll see Jupiter, and further east, you’ll see Mars. Once they are all visible, the planets will stretch across the southern sky from west to east”. Wilcox added that those with telescopes at home should also be able to spot two other planets, Uranus and Neptune. “They’re a bit farther out as they’re the edge of the solar system, so they will not be visible to the naked eye, but if you have a good telescope, you can look in the same direction to see them,” Wilcox said. “They’ll be in the same line as the rest of the planets, but you do need to have a bit of experience with the telescope to be able to spot those two,” she added. Wilcox went on to explain that the final planet in the solar system, Mercury (sorry Pluto) may also be visible on “particularly clear evenings”. “We’ll hopefully get some good skies towards the end of February, because Mercury will be popping up above the horizon as well, which will give you an additional planet in the sky. It looks like around the 27th will be the best time to see Mercury,” she said. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: America needs to pull off a colossal building plan to reach a new 'Intelligence Age'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/america-intelligence-age-ai-infrastructure-sam-altman-biden-trump-china-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:45:37Z
Full Content:
America is ready to reach a new age of intelligence. Getting there —and staying ahead of rival nations in the AI race — depends on a plan to transform the physical world that's becoming more formidable by the day. Leaders driving the AI boom entered 2025 by getting louder about the radical transformation they say is needed on US soil to deliver an era of AI-led superintelligence: more data centers, more chip plants, and more power infrastructure. By taking root in the physical world — huge data center facilities depend on complex wiring, hardware, and integration with power infrastructure across vast amounts of landmass — the hope is that AI software could one day transform society the way the Industrial Age did. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, calls this next leap the "Intelligence Age." In a September blog post, Altman said its defining characteristic would be "massive prosperity." However, he cautioned that without enough infrastructure, "AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." Last week, in one of his final executive orders, President Joe Biden signaled intent to build more at home with plans to lease acres of federal land to private sector firms with the know-how to develop complex AI infrastructure. The intent to build is likely to continue after Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, as tech leaders rally around the incoming president and put AI among the top priorities on his agenda. Biden's executive order followed the release of a blueprint from OpenAI a day earlier, which claimed "the economic opportunity AI presents is too compelling to forfeit" by not building the infrastructure needed. Data centers, power plants, and chip manufacturing plants will all cost money — a lot of money. Goldman Sachs estimates that roughly $1 trillion will be spent in the next few years alone to develop the infrastructure needed to bring today's AI models closer to superintelligence. It's why the big question investors and companies must now grapple with is whether or not they are willing to put up money for a vision of the future that is hardly guaranteed. Altman has offered no shortage of reasons for spending so much money on achieving superintelligence. Ensuring technological hegemony over China is one. As his company said last week, "there's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects" that "will flow to China-backed projects" and strengthen Beijing if not directed to the US. Another is that superintelligence could unlock unimaginable prosperity for society. Altman recently said that "if we could fast-forward a hundred years," the prosperity from superintelligence would feel just as unimaginable as today's world would to a lamplighter, a person employed to light and maintain street lights until about the 1950s. The third reason is perhaps more surprising. In a blog published at the start of the year, Altman said his company is now confident that it knows how to build artificial general intelligence, a term often interchanged with superintelligence despite their differences. It's a combination of factors that will, in some way, have triggered the flood of comments from those who want to play their part in developing the infrastructure needed to deliver superintelligence. In a blog published this month titled "The Golden Opportunity for American AI," Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company planned to spend $80 billion alone this year on data centers. "Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation's economy," he said. Last year, in conjunction with BlackRock and others, the tech giant unveiled a fund focused on AI infrastructure with an investment potential of up to $100 billion. In an interview with Semafor last month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that he was ready to work on a "Manhattan Project" for AI once Donald Trump takes office, underscoring the scale of the development and investment needed by invoking the World War II program that eventually produced the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank committed $100 billion to investing in the US over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. While there is clear intent to develop AI infrastructure, it's not clear if or when the investments will pay off — for two key reasons. First, much of the infrastructure needed in the US faces an uphill struggle to get built. Take chip plants. US companies like Nvidia, Google, AMD, and others that specialize in designing chips have developed a significant reliance on Taiwanese firm TSMC to manufacture those chips in the Far East, where a combination of cheap, skilled labor, economies of scale, and a long history of government support for the semiconductor sector has made the incredibly expensive business of manufacturing chips easier to pull-off. Simply throwing capital at projects aimed at getting chips manufactured in the US won't cut it. Efforts to build chip manufacturing plants at home have been taking shape — the Biden administration's CHIPS Act has provided billions of dollars of grants to semiconductor firms in the US — but there remains a huge gap between the capabilities of manufacturers in the East versus those at home. The AI boom has been kind to TSMC, with its value roughly doubling last year to $1.1 trillion. US chip manufacturer Intel, meanwhile, more than halved to around $85 billion. Clean power infrastructure, increasingly focused on nuclear power, also faces challenges. Returns on investment in nuclear power projects meant to provide clean energy to intensive data centers are highly uncertain. These projects also face significant regulatory hurdles. In December, for instance, the States of Texas, Utah, and Washington D.C.-based company Last Energy sued the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over claims that the government agency was applying the same risk analysis to small modular reactors as it was to large-scale power plants. These SMRs, as they're known, are meant to make access to nuclear power cheaper, given their compactness and greater affordability versus traditional nuclear plants. But even these face roadblocks. The second big reason that investors may want to approach infrastructure investment with caution is that the emergence of superintelligence remains highly speculative. Altman's claim that there is now a clear path to AGI is worth taking seriously, as new models like OpenAI's o3 released in December demonstrate increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities that do more than just parrot their training data. That said, there have been rumblings across the industry recently about AI models hitting a wall in terms of performance improvements. Without really serious advances in capabilities, then, or a clearly defined path forward to superintelligence, it is not clear how or when these colossal bets on AI infrastructure will pay off. But with China and other nations showing no sign of slowing down, it is clear that the cost of not being in the AI race could be far greater. Jump to

Title: Italy's powerful Agnelli family invests differently. Now its $6 billion asset manager is coming to America.

Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:03:01Z

One of the most interesting asset managers in Europe has made it to America. Lingotto Investment Management, with $6 billion in assets under management, has generated plenty of intrigue in its short existence. It was formed in 2023 by Exor, the holding company for the wealth of the Agnelli family, which owns Fiat, Ferrari, The Economist, and the Italian soccer team Juventus. Lingotto launched as an investment house giving tenured portfolio managers a sleeve of capital and free range to invest — some bets include a private German robotics company and CBS's parent company, Paramount. The firm, which was founded by the billionaire Agnelli heir John Elkann and whose chair is former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, has raised billions in outside capital and is operated separately from Exor. Now the manager is expanding to New York, where it already has 14 employees, including investing talent, on the ground. The 50-person firm, based in London, considers New York and London to be its "two pillars," Enrico Vellano, Lingotto's CEO, said in an interview with Business Insider. "The idea is to continue to grow and invest in the US but also in the UK," he said. The firm has lured in James Anderson, a star tech investor and former Baillie Gifford partner, and BlackRock executive Pam Chan to run different strategies. Matteo Scolari and Nikhil Srinivasan, two longtime Exor-connected investors, manage their own books. The investors' focuses are across the board — limited-partner stakes in other funds, public tech companies, quirky private opportunities — and they can pursue their ideas on their own timelines, which can be yearslong, without constant tinkering from a central risk manager or overarching investment commitment. This proposition has been enticing to portfolio managers as well as prospective backers. "Each team is empowered and very independent," said Scolari, whose ties to the Agnelli family go back a generation to when his father worked as the head of research and development at Fiat decades ago. In an interview with BI, he said the structure set the firm apart. "I think that's really important — I really believe in this approach," he added. The firm doesn't like the word "platform," but it's impossible to avoid comparisons between today's dominant multistrategy managers and Lingotto. These platforms have become some of the biggest names in alternative investing, in part because they can absorb so much capital from sovereign wealth funds and pensions and diversify it across dozens of investing teams. The industry's biggest investors prefer multistrategy funds because of their consistency and lack of volatility, which they achieve through tight risk limits and short-term investment horizons. Lingotto employs multiple investors who operate quasi-independently of each other, like Citadel and Millennium. But the similarities between Lingotto and the biggest hedge funds end there. At Lingotto, the ultimate authority over its four strategies lies with the heads of said strategies. There's no firmwide chief investment officer but four different CIOs. "I really liked the idea of the autonomy," Anderson said in an interview with BI. He runs the firm's $700 million innovation strategy alongside Morgan Samet, the strategy's cohead who used to work for the value-investment shop Pzena and the private-equity firm THL. The innovation team plans to invest in companies across their life cycle, including when they are private, and hold them through volatile patches. "You need to be prepared to suffer," said Anderson, who was an early investor in Tesla and Amazon and a big believer in Nvidia's potential. "Where we earn our returns is by being supporters of these companies during their downturns," he added. The long-term nature of the firm's capital, thanks to Exor's role in the formation of the company, allows Anderson and Samet — and the firm's three other strategy heads — to worry less about short-term gains and more about long-term ideas. "We're not scared of volatility," Samet said. "We see that as more of an opportunity, " she added. While the firm wants to be viewed as more than just the investment arm of the Agnelli family — and already has outside capital from the French insurer Covéa — Lingotto is the brainchild of Elkann, the billionaire heir. In a public letter after the firm launched, Elkann quoted the 18th-century philosopher Adam Smith to stress how his family would be investing alongside any outside capital. "Above all, we think and act as principals rather than agents," he wrote. Lingotto, named after an iconic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy, with a rooftop test track that began operations in 1923, plans to grow through "performance rather than capital inflows," he added. The first to run strategies for the firm were a pair of longtime family connections, Scolari and Srinivasan, who now run the intersection and horizon strategies, respectively. Scolari previously worked for Eton Park, the now shuttered hedge fund founded by the former Goldman Sachs partner Eric Mindich, and joined Exor in 2015. Srinivasan, meanwhile, was the chief investment officer at Allianz Investment Management and an HPS partner before joining Exor in 2018. The pair have very different strategies — Scolari runs a concentrated book of public equity longs and shorts, while Srinivasan manages a portfolio of other funds as well as direct investments into private companies — but similar experiences working at the firm. Without the pressures of managing a business, the two chief investment officers can focus on their main job: investing. "You have a pool of capital, you have trust from the LPs and GPs, and you have clarity for what you're supposed to be doing from an investment point of view," said Srinivasan, who invests in companies around the globe and spoke with BI from Singapore. "The stresses created are our own stresses," he added. With the firm's momentum and burgeoning reputation, it might seem like the next step would be a significant hiring spree to grow the ranks even further. While Lingotto's leaders are always looking for top people, Vellano said the firm wanted the right people for the structure, not just more people. Chan, a former BlackRock private-markets executive, is an example. Chan, who is based in New York and runs the mosaic strategy, said her portfolio was focused on the parts of the private markets that don't fit neatly into the buckets of the biggest private-asset managers. Right now, for example, she's got her eyes on the content industry, including nontraditional players like YouTube creators. "Novelty is a big part of what we do," she said. She was early into the music-rights business, something massive asset managers like KKR have now gotten into. She focuses on areas where there's a "capital demand-supply imbalance," a time-intensive strategy that requires her and her team to scour the market for deals. She said Lingotto's structure gives her the bandwidth to do that by "allowing investors to invest." It fits neatly into Vellano's vision. "We will remain a boutique" that focuses on "quality investors and LPs," he said, adding: "It's important we have that alignment." Jump to

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks climbed as President Donald Trump struck a better-than-feared tone on global trade and speculation grew that his policies will further boost Corporate America. Bonds continued to unwind the recent surge in yields that roiled markets. The dollar wavered.

A closely watched exchange-traded fund tracking companies with AI exposure hit a three-year high. Small caps climbed on bets they will benefit from a protectionist stance. Trump’s flurry of executive orders helped boost space shares, while weighing on electric-vehicle makers. An ETF focused on big Chinese firms gained as the US president so far refrained from announcing tariffs on the Asian nation.

Mexico’s peso and Canada’s loonie got hit as Trump outlined levies he expects to place on both countries by Feb. 1. “Risky assets should benefit from deregulation and tariffs emerging as not so bad as feared,” said Mohit Kumar at Jefferies International Ltd. “For rates, less onerous tariffs and likely lower oil prices should be a positive.” Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management, says it’s time to see what speculation was “founded” and what was “just nonsense” when it comes to tariffs. Meantime, she noted that Trump faces a crucial test on another front. “We’ll start seeing more headlines around debt-ceiling talks, and possibly, more stress on the shorter end of the Treasury curve,” she said. The debt ceiling is frequently used for leverage amid budget negotiations in Congress, with agreements often made at the last minute. As a result, the standoffs typically ripple through short-term interest rates as investors dump Treasury bills most vulnerable to a potential default in favor of other securities. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2%. The Russell 2000 of small caps rallied 1.8%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps added 0.3%. In late hours, Netflix Inc. soared after reporting its biggest quarterly subscriber gain in history. United Airlines Holdings Inc. issued a bullish outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.56%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed. “Last week, the equity markets experienced a broad rally, supported by cooler inflation data, upbeat earnings from banks, and a recovery from short-term oversold conditions and negative sentiment,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “We expect further upside in equities, supported by the return of Trump’s ‘business and investor-friendly’ policies. The “presidential scorecard” of stock-market performance is resetting this Tuesday, with Trump beginning his day in the White House for the first time in four years. For Joe Biden’s entire presidency, the Dow Jones Industrial average rallied 39.4% — about 18 percentage points less than the four years under his Trump’s first administration — and over 100 percentage points less than the 149.4% during the eight years of the Obama era, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. “While the Dow’s performance under Biden was the weakest of the last three presidents, it was still nothing to sneeze at, and it caps off a third straight period of strong gains under a presidential term,” Bespoke said. “Let these performance numbers serve as a reminder that as an investor you should never let your politics and investment decisions overlap.” Since 1944, from the election through the inauguration day, the S&P 500 gained an average 1.6%, according to Sam Stovall at CFRA. During the subsequent “First 100 (calendar) Days”, the S&P 500 gained an average of 2.1%, he noted. “What’s more, the performances of S&P 500 sectors and sub-industries during the ‘Post-Election Honeymoon Period’ have been predictive of sector and sub-industry leadership for the entire year,” Stovall added. Since 1993, the top four sectors from election day through inauguration day posted an average calendar-year increase of 17% versus the S&P 500’s average 15.9% rise and outperformed the broad benchmark 75% of the time, Stovall said. Even better, the top-10 S&P 500 sub-industries posted an average calendar-year increase of 26.8% and also beat the market 75% of the time, he concluded. This time around, there are early signs that investors are preparing for equity laggards to rally on bets that Trump could take a softer-than-feared stance on global trade, according to a survey by Bank of America Corp. If concerns around Trump’s tariff proposals prove to be “unfounded,” investor allocations would remain risk-on and stock markets that have trailed the powerful rally in the US would play catch up, BofA strategist Michael Hartnett said. In what could be a different macro/market regime in 2025, with a moderate pick-up in economic growth, we want to look for other equity markets that have reversion potential and have positive earnings revisions, according to Emily Roland and Matt Miskin at John Hancock Investment Management. “US large-cap value (financials heavy) and US mid-caps (industrials heavy) are the two best options across globally equities that offer reversion potential and improving earnings trends,” they noted. “Non-US equities and US small-caps could get a boost simply from the rotation trends, but fundamentally not as strong.” Roland and Miskin also added that investors don’t have to go far to benefit from the potential deconcentration of the S&P 500 from the top 10 mostly technology-driven growth stocks. “Simply a value tilt or moving down in cap a bit, may give them plenty of fundamentally favorable opportunities,” they concluded. “Our base case for the US economy is for ‘growth despite tariffs’,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “While we will be closely monitoring for risks, we do not believe that the tariff measures outlined in our base case would be sufficient to derail US growth. Nor do we believe that such tariffs would preclude inflation continuing to fall from current levels, enabling the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50bps later this year.” The latest dovish inflation readings are “game-changers,” and should provide a Goldilocks backdrop for risk assets over the coming months, HSBC says. The bank’s strategists led by Max Kettner expect only very shallow drawdowns in the coming months and would use any dips to boost risk asset exposure. They say sentiment and positioning are still flashing a buy signal. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, while many of the headlines related to Trump’s policies could have an important impact on the markets, earnings season — and forward guidance — should be extremely important as well. “With the market as expensive as it is today, there are some concerns about whether the positive aspects of these new policies may have already been priced into the stock market,” Maley said. “So, it’s going to be particularly important that the overall earnings picture does not begin to deteriorate in any meaningful manner.” Corporate Highlights: Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst. Charles Schwab Corp. reported results that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it continues to attract record inflows to its retail brokerage. 3M Co. expects profit to grow this year as Chief Executive Officer William Brown works to advance his plan to turn around the sprawling manufacturer. D.R. Horton Inc. reported earnings per share for the first quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. MicroStrategy Inc. shareholders voted for a 30 times increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares to help finance the company’s Bitcoin buying. B. Riley Financial Inc. suspended dividends on a pair of its preferred shares, holding off on cash payments to some investors while it prepares to pay off another set of notes coming due next month. Adidas AG reported better-than-expected results amid the sustained boom for retro sneakers like the Samba and more sales from its shrinking stockpile of Yeezy footwear.
