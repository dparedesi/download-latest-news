Title: Bitwise Says the Next Trillion-Dollar Crypto Wave Could Start With These 4 Tokens

The growing crypto push toward on-chain financial assets is drawing attention from institutional investors and analysts. According to a recent client note from Bitwise Asset Management, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Chainlink (LINK) may be among the most direct beneficiaries of the emerging tokenization narrative. The report suggests that the surge in blockchain-based representations of stocks, bonds, and other real-world assets (RWAs) is no longer theoretical and could begin influencing crypto prices sooner than previously expected. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen outlined this perspective in their latest analysis. They argue that while tokenization has long been considered a future trend, recent milestones suggest the infrastructure and momentum needed to support adoption are already materializing. In the last month alone, Robinhood and crypto exchange Kraken have introduced tokenized stock trading platforms, built on crypto networks such as Arbitrum and Solana, respectively. Though currently limited to non-US users, Coinbase has also filed with the SEC to bring tokenized equities to the US market. Simultaneously, financial institutions invested $135 million into the Canton Network, a Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for trading tokenized stocks and bonds. Participants in the round included Tradeweb, Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and DTCC, signaling institutional buy-in. These advancements come amid regulatory support, as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins labeled tokenization a significant innovation and suggested a pivot from punitive enforcement to proactive development. At the same time, real-world applications continue to emerge. One of Latin America’s largest exchanges announced a $200 million tokenization initiative on the XRP Ledger, and Galaxy Digital warned tokenization could eventually impact traditional exchanges like the NYSE. Collectively, these moves point to a shift in how financial markets could operate going forward. Bitwise’s report suggests that ETH, SOL, XRP, and LINK stand out as “clean” investment vehicles to gain exposure to the tokenization trend. Ethereum’s role as the foundation for Arbitrum, Solana’s adoption by Kraken, the XRP Ledger’s use in real-world asset programs, and Chainlink’s role in connecting off-chain data to smart contracts make them logical candidates for long-term inclusion. The note also emphasizes that diversifying across these crypto networks may be more effective than backing a single protocol. The analysts further referenced BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who in his 2024 shareholder letter asserted that “every asset can be tokenized.” With global stock and bond markets representing a combined $257 trillion, the total addressable market for tokenization is substantial. The Bitwise analysts added that even modest adoption, 1% to 5% penetration, could translate into trillions of dollars flowing through blockchain ecosystems. Bitwise’s conclusion: the tokenization narrative, once considered speculative, may already be shaping the next major cycle in crypto markets.

Title: Serial winner Gus McCarthy planning to carry his happy habit into the Ireland fold
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/07/10/serial-winner-gus-mccarthy-planning-to-carry-his-happy-habit-into-the-ireland-fold/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T05:00:01Z

Gus McCarthy has never been on the losing side in a Test match or a Champions Cup game. It is a striking statistic for the 21-year-old Leinster and Ireland hooker. On Saturday he will look to maintain that record when Ireland take on Portugal in Lisbon (7pm Irish time). He has played 20 matches in senior professional rugby and suffered defeat just twice, both in United Rugby Championship (URC) games. McCarthy is a serial winner. He led his school, Blackrock College, to a Leinster Schools Senior Cup crown. He captained the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations grand slam and a place in the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to a brilliant French team. McCarthy’s progression from Leinster to Ireland debuts came in just under six months, via an Emerging Ireland tour. The ACL injury suffered by Dan Sheehan in July 2024 provided an opening, which the young hooker followed up on. He scored a try in his first cap against Fiji last November, provided an assist for three others and finished the match in the backrow because of injuries. The Leinster man then followed up with another try-scoring cameo in the 22-19 victory over Australia. McCarthy won two further caps off the bench in the Six Nations. That was a major achievement in itself as the two players ahead of him at Leinster and Ireland are currently away with the Lions − Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher. McCarthy said of his rapid rise from rookie to the Test environment: “I’ve been delighted with the opportunities I’ve got, but obviously I’m in Leinster and it’s a very, very tough challenge. I’ve got two probable Lions Test players in the same position as me. “I haven’t played a whole amount. I didn’t really get involved in any of the URC knockout stages and the latter end of the Champions Cup, but I did get quite a bit of game time in the middle of the season. It’s good to learn from the best, some seriously good talent. The competition is endless; it keeps you on your toes. “I wouldn’t say it’s frustrating. Obviously, I would like to play but I’m still very inexperienced. I try to take every opportunity I get and just bide my time.” He smiles when the word “meteoric” is mentioned. “It did happen sooner than I would have thought. I thought I was just going to be training for the first week of Portugal (in November) but then I got held on. “For the week of the Argentina game, I was back with Leinster and then I thought I was done, but I got the call on the Sunday night asking me to come into camp again and then I got named to start in that Fiji match. I wasn’t expecting it, but I was delighted to get a shot.” He was part of an Irish front-row alongside Jack Boyle (2) and Thomas Clarkson (6) that had a combined 12 caps when Ireland faced into last week’s Test in Tbilisi. Whatever about the callow nature of the team, squaring up against Georgia in a scrum is not for the fainthearted. It is a rigorous technical examination. While Ireland did experience issues initially in that facet of the game, they successfully worked their way through them and won the game 34-5. So, what was the scrum Test like? “I really enjoyed the experience of playing against that Georgian pack,” he said. “The Georgians are known for being a seriously strong scrum, big front-row, abrasive players. It was a great test for us as a young and relatively inexperienced pack. Everything wasn’t perfect but I think we did a good job and got stuck into them physically.” Saturday will provide a contrasting test, fast and loose in the sweltering temperatures of Lisbon and a Portugal side that will engage Ireland in a different way to Georgia. McCarthy can’t wait. He’s where he loves to be, in the match environment. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Bitcoin hits record high of $112,055; crypto stocks rally in response
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-of-112055-crypto-stocks-rally-in-response/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T03:27:36Z

Bitcoin has once again smashed through its previous records, surging past the $112,000 mark for the first time in its history to set a new all-time high on July 9. The milestone represents a significant achievement for the leading cryptocurrency as it continues to recover from the market aftershocks of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and solidifies its position in an evolving financial landscape. As the broader crypto market continues its recovery, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new record high of $112,055 on Tuesday. This fresh peak surpasses the previous all-time high of $111,970.17, which was set on May 22. The digital asset has been trading in a volatile range since then, with the area around the $110,000 level proving to be a significant psychological and technical barrier. Over the past several weeks, each time Bitcoin’s price neared this level, it was met with a combination of profit-taking from existing holders and increased pressure from short-sellers. This latest decisive break suggests a new wave of bullish momentum has taken hold. The journey of Bitcoin, first introduced in a 2008 white paper by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been remarkable. Launched in 2009 as the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency, it has grown to become the largest digital asset, with a current market capitalization of $2.18 trillion. At the time of this report, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 65% of the total crypto market capitalization of $3.4 trillion. From crossing the $100 mark in April 2013 to the $1,000 mark in November of that same year, its path has been marked by staggering growth. It first hit the $10,000 level in November 2017 and reached a memorable peak of $69,000 in November 2021. Following President Trump’s victory in his second presidential election, it set a new all-time high of $76,999 in early November 2024, before crossing the landmark $100,000 target in early December 2024. A key factor underpinning Bitcoin’s current strength is its growing acceptance within the traditional financial system. With the Trump administration signaling its validation of Bitcoin through its plan to create a strategic US Bitcoin reserve, and with the continued institutional adoption led by Wall Street giants such as BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the “king coin” appears to have found a more secure home, at least for now, within the US financial ecosystem. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, a prime example of this institutional integration, now currently owns 3.5% of the total supply of Bitcoin. The success of this and other spot Bitcoin ETFs has had a profound effect on institutional investment and has likely influenced the broader market optimism. While the new all-time high is a headline-grabbing event, some market watchers have noted that the build-up to this moment has been relatively slow and quiet, which they interpret as a potentially bullish setup for what’s to come. “Crypto feels so quiet, [while] bitcoin is ready to move,” wrote Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report. Morris pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility has been steadily declining, a pattern that has historically preceded large upward price movements. This sentiment was reflected in the performance of crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR) were higher by 4.4%, trading at $414, just a few dollars shy of its highest level in 2025 (though still well below its record high of $543 set late last year). Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) was ahead by 5%, and Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were both up by roughly 6%, all riding the wave of Bitcoin’s record-breaking achievement.

Title: Seattle Startup Backed By Khosla Ventures Charges $10,000 For 'Blood Cleaning' That Claims To Make You Biologically 2.61 Years Younger
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/management/25/07/46333750/seattle-startup-backed-by-khosla-ventures-charges-10000-for-blood-cleaning-that-claims-to-make-you-biologically-2-61-years-younger
Time Published: 2025-07-10T00:30:48Z

Longevity startup Circulate Health announced Wednesday that it has raised $12 million in seed funding to expand a pricey outpatient service it calls ‘targeted blood cleaning.' The treatment, known as therapeutic plasma exchange, removes a patient's blood, separates the liquid plasma, and then returns the blood cells with a replacement fluid. Circulate Health says this process clears out inflammation and biological compounds linked to aging. According to GeekWire, the procedure costs between $8,000 and $10,000 per session and is not covered by insurance. Since May 2024, the Seattle-based company says it has completed over 1,000 treatments in eight states through a network of 24 clinics. Don't Miss: Today's Best Finance Deals Circulate Health co-founder and CEO Dr. Brad Younggren told GeekWire that they "saw a lot of expected outcomes that would be consistent with cellular rejuvenation." A study published in Aging Cell by Circulate Health and Buck Institute for Research on Aging observed 42 participants, with one group receiving six plasma exchanges plus a dose of antibodies. That group experienced a 2.61-year average reduction in biological age, according to the company. However, the trial lasted only three to five months, and experts say more research is needed. Dr. Jeffrey Winters, chair of transfusion medicine at the Mayo Clinic, told the New York Times that the findings do not show the therapy leads to longer or healthier lives. The study's final blood samples showed diminishing effects, suggesting that any benefit may taper off over time. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Circulate Health operated in stealth for two years and officially launched in January 2024 when Younggren joined as CEO. According to GeekWire, his co-founder is Dr. Eric Verdin, CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. Khosla Ventures led the $12 million seed round, joined by Seaside Ventures and CSC Ventures. Robbie Schwietzer, former chief product officer at 98point6, also joined the Circulate Health team as chief operating officer, GeekWire says. “We incubated Circulate to explore whether a safe, well-understood therapy like therapeutic plasma exchange could counter the deleterious effects of aging, and offer broader health benefits like potentially removing microplastics from the body,” Khosla Ventures partner Alex Morgan said in the statement. “Early clinical results are promising, and we’re excited to continue backing the team as they work to make therapeutic plasma exchange more accessible to more people.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now The U.S. longevity tech market has pulled in $1.8 billion in investment since 2021, according to PitchBook. In 2024 alone, startups in the space raised nearly $300 million as investors doubled down on areas like epigenetic reprogramming and senolytics, fields targeting the root causes of aging rather than just its symptoms. Backed by visionaries such as Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman, PitchBook says the sector is gaining momentum despite regulatory uncertainty and long development timelines. Circulate Health's competitors include MaxWell Clinic and Next Health, both offering similar treatments. The difference, Circulate Health claims, according to Geekwire, lies in their replacement fluid: albumin instead of saline, and the addition of targeted antibodies. Younggren said their method aims to improve longevity outcomes beyond what traditional plasma donation protocols offer. While the treatment remains expensive and uncovered by insurance, Younggren believes it could help prevent costly chronic illness down the line. "This notion of making America healthy again fits right in with what we're trying to do," Younggren told GeekWire.

Title: Rex-Osprey spot Solana ETF doubles cumulative inflows to $41M on July 8
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/rex-osprey-spot-solana-etf-doubles-cumulative-inflows-to-41m-on-july-8/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:18Z

Despite the increase, the net inflow amount represents 0.05% of Solana's total market cap, well below the proportions registered by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The first US-listed spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) received $21 million of net inflows on July 8, lifting its running total to $41.2 million, based on Farside Investors’ data. The one-day addition to the Rex-Osprey’s Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) 104% of the $20.2 million raised over the previous three trading sessions, effectively doubling net inflows. [Editor’s Note: SSK isn’t a pure spot ETF. At least 40% of its assets are allocated to other Solana ETFs, primarily issued outside the U.S., with the remainder directly invested in Solana. This structure was approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, differing from the approval route of the infamous spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Solana ETFs. These applications are currently under review.] SSK began trading on July 2 with a 0.75% management fee, triple the 0.25% headline charge that BlackRock and Fidelity levy on their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. Comparing the first four trading days for each asset class reveals a disconnect between the flows and the market capitalization of the underlying assets. Bitcoin spot ETFs earned about $2.9 billion during their first four sessions in January, which is roughly 0.34% of BTC’s market capitalization at the time. Ethereum spot ETFs absorbed almost $1.2 billion over their opening quartet in late June, or 0.3% of Ether’s market value once Grayscale’s legacy outflows are stripped out, per the same dataset. By contrast, Solana’s $41.2 million equates to approximately 0.05% of SOL’s circulating supply, roughly 16.7% of the penetration level achieved by the earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum launches. One reason for the divergence is the cost. Rex-Osprey’s 0.75% levy ranks as the highest among US spot crypto ETFs, while its seed inventory of just $600,000 suggests limited authorized participant warehousing capacity. Fidelity and BlackRock launched their Bitcoin funds with seed baskets exceeding $300 million and fee-waiver schedules that decreased to 0.12% and 0.20% during the first year. Furthermore, Rex-Osprey remains the sole issuer of Solana ETFs that directly hold SOL. While the small base and higher expense ratio leave SSK’s early intake below that of its large-cap counterparts, the fund’s doubling on July 8 shows an incremental appetite from allocators undeterred by cost.

Title: Institutions Buy Bitcoin In Record Numbers, But Why Is Price Still Below $111,900 ATH?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/institutions-buy-large-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:09Z

Institutions like BlackRock and Metaplanet continue to actively accumulate Bitcoin, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. BTC has, however, remained below its current all-time high (ATH) due to factors such as tariffs and selling pressure from old whales. SosoValue data shows that BlackRock has officially surpassed the 700,000 BTC milestone and now holds $76.35 billion in assets under management (AuM). The asset manager’s Bitcoin holdings account for 3.5% of the crypto’s total supply of 21 million. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is now way ahead of Saylor’s Strategy and the second-largest Bitcoin holder, behind Satoshi Nakamoto. BlackRock has achieved this milestone in less than two years since its Bitcoin ETF launched. Commenting on this milestone, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the asset manager now holds 700,000 BTC and is 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi. The Bloomberg analyst added that IBIT has on average accumulated 40,000 BTC a month or 1,300 BTC a day. Based on this pace, the asset manager is on course to 1.2 million BTC in May 2026. Besides BlackRock, Metaplanet is another institution that is actively accumulating Bitcoin in record numbers. The company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, announced that they have acquired 2,205 BTC for $238.7 million at $108,237 per bitcoin, achieving a BTC yield of 416.6% YTD. Metaplanet now holds 15,555 BTC, which it acquired for $1.54 billion at $99,307 per bitcoin. BitcoinTreasuries’ data shows that Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest Bitcoin treasury company, only behind Strategy, MARA, Twenty One Capital, and Riot platforms. Other companies like MARA Holdings, Semler Scientific, and ProCap BTC have also expanded their Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting the massive demand for the flagship crypto. Macro factors like the Trump tariffs continue to pose an obstacle to a new uptrend for the Bitcoin price. The US president recently sparked panic in the markets with his trade letters, which he sent to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, imposing a reciprocal tariff on them. These tariffs are set to take effect from August 1, and Trump has declared that he has no intention to extend the trade deadline again. The Bitcoin price dropped from its weekly high above $109,000 amid this development and is again at risk of reaching new weekly lows. The BTC price also looks to be facing selling pressure from old whales, which matches the buying pressure from these institutions. Bloomberg reported that early Bitcoin whales have sold over 500,000 BTC in the past year, which roughly matches the net inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. One early Bitcoin whale also recently moved 80,000 BTC, raising concerns that they were looking to offload these coins. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: SEC pushes back decision on in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock Ethereum ETF

Share this article The SEC has extended its timeline to rule on Nasdaq’s proposal to enable BlackRock’s spot Ethereum, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), to offer in-kind creations and redemptions, according to a new filing. The in-kind model under SEC review, which mirrors traditional commodity ETF mechanics, would allow Authorized Participants (APs) to transfer Ethereum (ETH) directly, replacing the current cash-based creation and redemption process to reduce slippage and simplify operations. In practice, APs would be able to deliver actual Ether to the ETF issuer in exchange for new shares, and redeem shares to receive Ether back, rather than settling them in cash. BlackRock submitted an amended S-1 registration statement to the SEC in May, seeking approval to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its ETHA fund. The asset manager is also awaiting a regulatory decision on a similar in-kind model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Other fund managers, including 21Shares, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Bitwise, and VanEck, have also filed to enable in-kind creation and redemption for their crypto ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously said that in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are “definitely coming at some point.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Q&A: Will survivors of historical abuse in schools be compensated? And who will be liable?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/07/09/qa-will-survivors-of-historical-abuse-in-schools-be-compensated-and-who-will-be-liable/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T19:04:29Z
Full Content:
The Government has establishment a commission of investigation into historical sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools. What scale of abuse is thought to have occurred? An initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. Most of these allegations were reported from the records of some 42 religious orders that run, or previously ran, schools in the State. When did this abuse occur? The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. What prompted the inquiry in the first place? In a RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys, broadcast in November 2022, brothers Mark and David Ryan outlined how they had both been sexually abused at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College in the 1970s, discovering each other’s abuse there only in 2002. The broadcast prompted a public outcry and a surge in allegations of abuse, mostly in religious-run day and boarding schools. Are just religious schools the subject of a scoping inquiry? No – it is all schools. The commission will have a remit to examine the handling of sexual abuse in all types of schools, primary and second level. This reflects the views of survivors. A scoping inquiry recommended that the commission’s terms of reference include the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse across all primary and post-primary schools. Will the voices of survivors be included? A “survivor engagement process” forms part of the commission. This provides a confidential space where they can share the impact of their experiences. It is not a legal process, however. Will survivors be compensated? That is the intention. Minister for Education Helen McEntee says further work is being done to examine the matter of financial redress and how any future scheme could be funded. This is viewed by many survivors as a measure of accountability for those responsible for sexual abuse in schools. Can religious orders be forced to contribute? Given the difficulties in extracting funds from religious orders in the past for abuse-related issues, many will be sceptical about whether this is possible. The Government says a further phase of detailed investigation and data analysis on this issue is essential. Ms McEntee has said “all potential levers that can be brought to bear to secure funding from those responsible for sexual abuse in schools” will be considered. This is likely to include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. The reality, however, is that survivors do not know what they will get, or when, or if they will get redress at all – and there is no clear pathway towards ensuring religious orders pay into a scheme. Will the State be liable? It could be. Some campaigners, such as Louise O’Keeffe, who won a landmark case following abuse in primary school, argue that her case established the principle that the State had an obligation to protect pupils from past ill-treatment at school and should have put safeguarding measures in place to help minimise the risk of sexual abuse. Worries over the extent of the potential redress bill and its impact on the exchequer run deep. In 2023, for example, officials in the Department of Education outlined that a broad scheme would expose the exchequer to “unquantifiable and potentially enormous costs”. Earlier this year, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure warned that the recommendations from the scoping inquiry have the potential to “very significantly impact on public finances”. As of now, however, the State cannot confidently measure its liability, nor ignore the risk of footing the bill. How will the commission work? Mr Justice Michael MacGrath – appointed to the High Court in January 2018 and a judge on the Court of Appeal since June 2024 – will chair the commission. It is due to undertake preliminary work over the coming months and will seek initial expressions of interest from people who may wish to provide information to it. As with many other statutory inquiries, what are the chances of this dragging on for years? The commission has been given a time frame to report within five years. Ms McEntee said the terms of reference are set out “very clearly” to ensure it does not go over time. “There is a very clear pause within the first two years to make sure that the commission can highlight any problems that arise,” she said. “But also it works both ways, that the minister can then identify if issues are emerging, how the work is being done, and whether or not that will result in an outcome that is appropriate.” Are there implications for schools today? The report of the initial scoping inquiry found that current child protection systems in schools are “robust and effective”, but there are recommendations for further safeguarding steps. The department said it has already begun to implement these recommendations.

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer (CIO) of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, is predicting an explosion in the tokenization of traditional assets. In a new blog post, Hougan says that the transition of stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) onto blockchains instead of traditional systems may happen much quicker than he previously thought. “I still think it will take more than a decade before the majority of stock and bond trading happens on-chain. But with major financial firms like Robinhood and Tradeweb positioning themselves for the transition today, I’ve started to wonder: could tokenization achieve 1-5% penetration in a few years? Could a dozen major pilot projects lift us to that level of market penetration? It seems possible, and it would translate into trillions of dollars … more than any other crypto application or asset, including Bitcoin. The narrative around tokenization is only going to accelerate from here – if Robinhood is rolling out tokenized trading, you can bet that Charles Schwab and others are studying it aggressively. I’d expect a wave of additional announcements this fall.” Hougan names several crypto projects that could give investors exposure to an RWA tokenization boom. “The cleanest way to invest in the rise of tokenization is to buy a basket of the top layer-1 blockchains and infrastructure plays: Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, etc.” Hougan also notes how Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, highlighted the massive growth potential for tokenization of RWAs in his 2025 annual shareholder letter, saying, “Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized.” If Larry Fink is right, Hougan says the “tokenization market could grow over 4,000x in the coming years.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: France not fit to replace BlackRock in Ukraine – party leader to RT
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621249-france-blackrock-ukraine-philippot/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T16:01:36Z
Full Content:
The reported plans by the French government to replace US investment holding BlackRock in Ukraine are “unacceptable” for the EU nation’s people, the leader of France’s Patriots party, Florian Philippot, told RT in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. BlackRock had been actively involved in developing a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund aimed at financing post-war reconstruction projects, with plans to attract $15 billion from public and private investors, including commitments from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The fund, which was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10-11, is now on hold, and France is reportedly working on an alternative plan. Last week, Bloomberg claimed, citing informed sources, that BlackRock halted the search for investors for its fund earlier this year due to US President Donald Trump’s rocky relations with the authorities in Kiev. The sources also claimed that France has been trying to set up an alternative structure that could take the spot freed by the US company in the country. However, they questioned if the reported French initiative could succeed without the American money. Philippot told RT that the report by Bloomberg came as a “complete surprise” for him. He reminded that France is €3.4 trillion (around $4 trillion) in debt and is about to face “extreme austerity,” blaming the situation on the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. ”We are no longer properly funding hospitals, farmers, security and many other expenditure items. How are we going to replace a behemoth like BlackRock in Ukraine under conditions of total military, diplomatic, financial and economic uncertainty?” the politician wondered. The general public will be against the alleged plans by the government in Paris once more people learn about them, Philippot insisted. “This is obviously unacceptable for the French,” he added. The Patriots party leader said that Macron’s moves regarding Kiev “make no sense,” urging France’s immediate and “total military and financial disengagement from Ukraine.” He also suggested that BlackRock withdrew from Ukraine because it realized that it is inevitably going to suffer a defeat at the hands of Russia. “You do not invest in a country that is going to lose,” Philippot explained. BlackRock, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.

Title: Kraken expands xStocks to BNB Chain enabling global access to tokenized equities

The expansion opens doors for global investors to trade tokenized US equities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Kraken has announced the expansion of its xStocks product to Binance-backed BNB Chain, marking a significant step toward making tokenized US equities more accessible globally. According to a July 9 statement, Kraken’s users outside the United States will soon be able to deposit and withdraw tokenized stocks, such as AAPLx, TSLAx, SPYx, and NVDAx, via BNB Chain. These assets, issued by Backed, will be deployed as BEP-20 tokens, providing seamless integration with DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap. Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO, said the expansion is part of the firm’s goal of building a “chain-neutral” and “always-on” capital market. He described tokenized equities as “programmable settlement primitives” that allow instant global transfers and atomic settlement. They also enable composability with on-chain financial products like derivatives and lending protocols. According to him: “In a world that will inevitably be multichain, it is critical that assets like equities can move fluidly across ecosystems, protocols, and liquidity layers without being gated by jurisdiction or legacy custodial rails.” Kraken’s move is part of a broader industry trend. Over the past months, several crypto-native platforms like Robinhood and Wall Street giants such as BlackRock have increasingly focused on tokenization. According to the Security Token Market, this trend is a result of a growing demand for tokenized assets, which are projected to soar to $30 trillion by 2030. Considering this, Galaxy Digital pointed out that the rapid growth of tokenization presents significant opportunities and challenges. The firm stated that the round-the-clock trading model gives users constant market access. However, it also exposes them to increased volatility during off-hours. Galaxy Digital warned that this shift could be more disruptive for traditional financial institutions. Traditional exchanges like the NYSE may face increased pressure as more brokerages move toward blockchain-based settlement and trading. Their dominance, built on centralized liquidity and structured hours, risks being eroded by platforms offering real-time trading and decentralized asset ownership. As a result, legacy exchanges must adapt or risk losing market activity. They also face the threat of losing core revenue sources, such as trading fees and data sales, to the newly emerging platforms. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The world’s largest asset manager has reportedly turned on US Treasuries. In a report seen by Bloomberg, BlackRock Investment Institute strategists recently upgraded their view on European government bonds from slightly underweight to neutral, comparing them positively to US government debt obligations. BlackRock also notes that the Federal Reserve may hold back on cutting interest rates due to sticky inflation, while high budget deficits might urge investors to ask for a higher yield premium to hold long-dated US bonds. “We prefer euro area government bonds and credit over the US. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our expectations relative to US Treasuries.” The BlackRock strategists specifically highlight bonds from Italy and Spain. The asset manager isn’t the only financial giant to take a less optimistic view of US Treasuries. Goldman Sachs market strategists also recently lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Goldman’s economists originally predicted the Fed would only enact one rate cut near the end of the year, but they are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. The Financial Times recently reported that $11 billion in US long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt were sold in only three months. The second quarter sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off occurring in 2022 Q2.

Title: JPMorgan Files to Launch Money Market ETF

The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Money doesn’t grow on trees — it grows in money markets, a resource that JPMorgan plans to help ETF investors access more easily as markets seek shelter from increasing volatility. The bank applied last month for SEC approval of the actively managed JPMorgan 100% US Treasury Securities Money Market ETF, which would invest exclusively in Treasury bills, bonds and notes, according to the filing. The move, along with recent money market ETF launches by Schwab and BlackRock, shows how issuers are capitalizing on investors’ appetite for lower-risk options amid geopolitical uncertainty and ETF hype. Still, inflows have yet to match the rapidity of recent money market ETF launches, according to Matthew Bartolini, State Street’s head of Americas ETF research. “They’re really new,” Bartolini said. “With any new thing, you want to see how it does, how its performance is, and if the use case is valuable enough to rotate from what you’re doing right now.” Money market funds — which invest in short-term, low-risk securities like US Treasury bills, municipal debt or corporate bonds — have been around as long as ETFs have existed. JPMorgan’s Prime Money Market Fund (VMVXX), a mutual fund that invests in both US government securities and debt issued by American and foreign corporations, began trading in 1993. Money market ETFs let clients who want an all-ETF portfolio include a cash management vehicle in it. “That same client could have been like, ‘Well, for my cash purposes, I’ll hold an ultra-short, active strategy.’ There’ve been those options, just not within a money market wrapper,” Bartolini said. “With that money market wrapper, you might get different clients to use it who prefer money markets for their cash sweep vehicle.” Other big players in the money market fund space include: A Sea Change. The recent launches are also representative of what experts describe as a shift toward mutual fund strategies being used in ETFs. Bartolini said JPMorgan’s move is unsurprising given the recent boom in other structured note products, like buffer ETFs. “This is another proof point of the ETF industry maturing,” he said, “and entering into different markets for investors to utilize strategies typically confined to mutual funds.” The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Rich investors with large stock portfolios and capital gains get a tax bonus with 351 ETF exchanges. The fund enters into swap agreements with J.P. Morgan and tracks an index from MerQube. The buy now, pay later business has a stigma that could hold back a proposed ETF focused on the market, one observer noted. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. Asset managers said active strategies are among their top choices for new products, per Morningstar. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. In the aftermath of the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day,” many investors are looking to buffer ETFs to protect against volatility. The company, which briefly owned the biggest spot bitcoin ETF, wants to invest in another potentially disruptive technology that could even pose a threat to crypto. © 2025 The Daily Upside

PHOTO: ST FILE Timothy Goh Sue-Ann Tan Published Jul 09, 2025, 03:00 PM Updated Jul 09, 2025, 09:38 PM SINGAPORE – Singapore investment company Temasek’s net portfolio value came in at $434 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2025, up $45 billion from a year ago. The increase was mainly due to the strong performance of listed Singapore-based Temasek portfolio companies and direct investments in China, the United States and India, the company said on July 9, adding that the $434 billion net portfolio value is a record high. Net portfolio value represents the total market value of listed assets and the book value of unlisted assets in an investment portfolio minus any liabilities. It provides a clear picture of the actual worth of the portfolio at a given point in time. In a measure of Temasek’s long-term portfolio performance, the 20-year total shareholder return (TSR) stayed at 7 per cent for a second year straight. The one-year TSR, which is more volatile, came in at 11.8 per cent, up from the 1.6 per cent in financial year (FY) 2024, driven by robust performance from Temasek’s Singapore-based portfolio companies, as well as strong returns in the US, China and India. The 10-year TSR came in at 5 per cent, down slightly from 6 per cent the year earlier, as the strong returns from March 2015 – a year of favourable market performance – dropped out of the measurement period. When it comes to marking its unlisted assets to market, Temasek’s net portfolio value hit $469 billion, an increase in value of $35 billion from a year ago. Mark-to-market value is an accounting practice that involves recording the value of an asset according to its current market price, rather than its book value or original cost. The investment company has been disclosing the mark-to-market value of its unlisted assets since 2022. Temasek’s listed investments comprise 51 per cent of its investment portfolio. Temasek deputy chief executive Chia Song Hwee said the firm’s Singapore-based portfolio companies’ strong performance this year demonstrates their progress in executing strategies aligned with their “stated targets”. “It affirms our ongoing active engagements with them to strengthen their business foundations, pivot and de-risk where necessary, and drive value creation,” he said. “We have been sharpening our investment discipline through more active portfolio management and will maintain this rigorous approach to enhance our returns over the long term.” Of Temasek’s portfolio, 41 per cent is in Singapore-based Temasek portfolio companies, which include household names such as DBS Bank, Singapore Airlines and Singtel. Another 36 per cent is in global direct investments, which are established or emerging market leaders aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, the future of consumption and longer lifespans. These firms include Shopee parent Sea and investment giant BlackRock. The remaining 23 per cent of the portfolio is held in partnerships, funds and asset management firms, including entities such as venture capital firm Vertex, asset management group Seviora and private equity firm 65 Equity Partners. Singapore remains the biggest market for the company, accounting for 27 per cent of its underlying assets in FY2025. A total of 52 per cent of Temasek’s portfolio companies are also headquartered in Singapore. The Americas are Temasek’s second-biggest market at 24 per cent, while the company’s underlying exposure to China dipped slightly to 18 per cent from 19 per cent a year earlier. Exposure to Europe, the Middle East and Africa stood at 12 per cent, and India at 8 per cent. Temasek chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani said the firm’s direct investments in markets like China, the US and India contributed to the uplift in its net portfolio value over the year. “The growth reflects both the impact of shifting macroeconomic conditions on asset prices and the long-term prospects of our investments aligned with structural tailwinds in these markets,” he said. “We will continue to actively invest in our key markets while also exploring new markets of scale that can add to our portfolio resilience.” In FY2025, the company invested $52 billion in areas aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, the future of consumption and longer lifespans. It divested $42 billion, which included a full divestment in liquefied natural gas company Pavilion Energy as well as partial divestments in fashion firm Moncler, food technology company Eternal (formerly known as Zomato) and Fullerton Financial Holdings. Temasek said these divestments allowed the firm to recycle capital and continue investing in companies that are aligned to the trends, such as food technology start-up Rebel Foods and snacks company Haldiram’s. The result is a net investment of $10 billion, compared with a net divestment of $7 billion in FY2024. Temasek has also made strides in its sustainable investments. Its portfolio value of investments aligned with the sustainable living trend reached $46 billion, up $2 billion from FY2024. Financial services as well as transportation and industrials remain the two largest sectors that Temasek is invested in. The investments are in a mix of listed and unlisted assets, with listed assets accounting for 51 per cent of the portfolio and unlisted assets accounting for the remaining 49 per cent. Looking ahead, Temasek said geopolitical tensions remain a key risk, which will likely dampen global growth. But it continues to hold a “constructive outlook” on investment opportunities, despite heightened trade and geopolitical uncertainties. Temasek noted that the US will remain a key investment destination while the company continues to maintain a diversified global exposure through its investments primarily in Europe, China and India. It also highlighted that Singapore’s economy will likely come under pressure this year, but the Republic has “ample fiscal and monetary policy levers that can be pulled” in the event of a more challenging growth backdrop. To build a resilient portfolio in the Republic, Temasek will continue to actively engage its Singapore portfolio companies to enhance value and future-proof their businesses. It will also work with partners and innovators, creating “synergistic networks” with them to further grow its capital and gain access to innovation. Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng said that like Singapore, Temasek and its Singapore portfolio companies have benefited from globalisation, expanding their footprint regionally and beyond. “Despite increasing global uncertainties, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to building a purpose-driven institution and constructing a portfolio that delivers sustainable returns over the long term,” he said.

Title: Bitcoin supply drops, institutions load up $164M in BTC – Will prices follow?

Time Published: 2025-07-09T07:00:39Z

Bitcoin demand surges as institutions and whales accumulate, signaling potential continuation of the current bullish run. Global demand for Bitcoin [BTC] has been rising steadily. Institutions and crypto whales are increasingly accumulating BTC, while adoption from traditional finance continues to grow. This trend is reflected in the surge in open interest across crypto markets. Recently, BlackRock added approximately 1,388 BTC, worth around $164.3 million, to its portfolio, underscoring institutional interest. At the same time, whale activity has intensified, with several large wallets acquiring significant amounts of Bitcoin. Such coordinated accumulation typically signals strong long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value, particularly among experienced, well-capitalized investors, often referred to as ‘smart money.’ Digging deeper into on-chain sentiments, BTC’s surge in Open Interest (OI) across derivatives platforms supports the growing demand. OI—essentially the total number of outstanding contracts, has been climbing steadily for the last month. This suggests that more capital is entering the market, both in anticipation of upward moves and as a hedge against volatility. Source: CoinGlass What makes this trend even more significant is that apart from retail driving the volume. Institutional capital, mostly flowing in through ETFs and other regulated products, is becoming a dominant force. This shift could build a stronger and more stable foundation for BTC’s next rally. According to CryptoQuant’s 30-day Apparent Demand metric, Bitcoin is experiencing steady accumulation. This on-chain indicator tracks broader demand trends while filtering out short-term market noise. AMBCrypto’s analysis of the same data also points to a positive demand outlook based on the 30-day sum. Historically, similar accumulation patterns have often preceded bullish rallies. When paired with ongoing institutional interest, this trend paints an encouraging picture of a potential demand-driven uptrend for BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Going hand in hand, the number of declined mined blocks also adds more weight to BTC bullish trends. The number of mined Bitcoin blocks has decreased recently, slowing the rate at which new BTC enters circulation. This creates a supply shortage, even as demand from whales and institutions continues to rise. This decline in supply strengthens Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, especially in a market where buying pressure from large investors is steadily increasing. Source: CryptoQuant With supply shrinking and demand rising, market dynamics are shifting in favor of further BTC price surges.

Title: For 14 years, Netanyahu has sought to nuclearly dismantle Iran and Pakistan, by Alfredo Jalife-Rahme
URL: https://www.voltairenet.org/article222640.html
Time Published: 2025-07-09T05:43:49Z

Statements made by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011 shed surprising light on his policy toward Iran. It could be that revisionist Zionists see themselves as protectors of the West. In this case, Iran’s ambition to master nuclear fusion would threaten transnational oil companies, and an attack on Iran would herald a future attack of Pakistan. Fourteen years ago, the talmudic and eschatological Netanyahu was questioned by the casual Dana Weiss in an interview published on the Israeli government website. At the 25th minute and 33rd second mark [1], to the question: "What is the biggest problem facing the next generation, and what must we do today to solve it?" The pugnacious Netanyahu replied: "Our primary mission is to prevent a militant Islamist regime from acquiring nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of a militant Islamist regime. The first is Iran, the second is Pakistan, specifically in the event that the Taliban take over Pakistan (...) So, the first thing to do is to prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons. That is our first mission, and the second is to find a substitute for oil." It is clear that the devitalized green agenda, now in free fall with the Trump oil company, is of Khazarian etiology. The interview with the loquacious Netanyahu took place 14 years ago, well before the defeat and withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden—four years ago already, and 10 years after the apocalyptic interview by the same Netanyahu—while today, the takeover of Pakistan by the Taliban ruling in Kabul is less likely. Today, most of the media controlled by the Israeli lobby in the West have spent their time distorting and reinterpreting in a Byzantine manner the eschatological Talmudic hermeneutic of the belligerent and lying Netanyahu. It is obvious that for Israel and its Western bankers (the four Khazarian horsemen: BlackRock/Rothschild Bank/George Soros/Bloomberg), the main enemies of Greater Israel are the six Arab petromonarchies, the nuclear Islamic countries, Iran (with its civilian project) and Pakistan, as well as the Muslim countries with oil/gas and water (e.g. Lebanon). The real black swan of the 12-day war waged by Israel and the United States against Iran—a veritable First World War of disinformation, rife with deceptions and lies—turned out to be the unreserved support of Sunni Pakistan, a middle-ranking nuclear power, for the Shia Islamic Republic of Iran. Today, as the results, mostly hidden by censorship in Israel, become less opaque, it can be said that Pakistan now represents, more than a black swan, a "gray rhinoceros (that is there and that we don’t want to see [2]). As the fog of disinformation surrounding the 12-day war dissipates, it is instructive to see how countries in the region are positioning themselves for the very likely scenario of a future war between Israel/the United States and Iran [3]. Irfan Raja of the Turkish daily Daily Sabah (30/6/25) wonders if "Pakistan is next in line, as part of the ’Greater Israel’ project [4]." Irfan Raja quotes Julian Spencer-Churchill, an Anglosphere military strategist disguised as a Pakistan expert, as saying without blushing: "Once Israel defeats Iran, it will be Pakistan’s turn [5]." Irfan Raja points out that the destruction of Pakistan’s nuclear assets has long been on Israel’s mission list, just as Israel had incited the destruction of Iraq and its non-existent weapons of mass destruction. He recalls that at the Aspen "Festival of Ideas" 11 years ago, Khazarian zealot Jeffrey Goldberg—who had served in the Israeli military—asked retired Admiral Mike Mullen (former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) which, between Pakistan and Iran, was more dangerous to the United States, to which the admiral replied: "Probably Pakistan." [6] Of course, neither of them was going to say that Israel is now much more dangerous to democracy in the United States. In this regard, the neoliberal globalist monarchist daily Financial Times expresses its concern that "Saudi Arabia is clinging to Iran after Israel’s war." [7] It would not be unreasonable to envisage a Sunni-Shiite AS/Pakistan/Iran axis under the aegis of China. [1] « A World View Interview with Benjamin Netanyahu», Les nouvelles, 2011.

Title: How to solo queue for old LFR difficulty raids to collect transmog (so much transmog)
URL: https://blizzardwatch.com/2025/07/08/solo-queue-old-lfr-raids-transmog/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T22:45:03Z

NEXT | All of the rewards from Manaforge Vandals in the Manaforge Omega ra... If you’re a transmog fiend, it’s okay, you’re among friends here — there’s no shame in wanting pretty outfits. And with the Collector’s Bounty event running through July 29, you’ll pick up twice the number of transmogs every run! Perfect. The easiest way to get gear from older raids, including raid sets and unique appearances, is to solo queue for LFR, which is available for most older raids that had an LFR difficulty. Currently, you can solo queue for raids from to Dragon Soul in Cataclysm to Sepulcher of the First Ones in Shadowlands, with new raids typically added two expansions later. Look for Dragonflight LFR to be added some time during Midnight. Beyond transmog, most pets can be farmed on LFR difficulty, though some mounts are restricted to Heroic or Mythic difficulty). So there are plenty of reasons to run these old raids — and solo queue LFR is trivial for any max level character to complete. But solo queuing for older raid tiers isn’t as straightforward as opening up the group finder. You have to speak to specific NPCs (usually in the capitol city of the expansion) to queue up for raids on your own. Here’s how to solo queue for LFR in old expansions to collect transmog, pets, and more. To queue for Shadowlands LFR, both factions talk to Ta’elfar in Oribos. He can be found in the Enclave, where you find Bolivar and all of the different Covenant NPCs. You can queue for all Castle Nathria, Sanctum of Domination, and Sepulcher of the First Ones. Unfortunately, the raid mounts this expansion are only available in Mythic difficulty, but there is a lot of very excellent transmog to collect at LFR level. There are two NPCs that will allow you to queue up for BFA raids on LFR difficulty, depending on whether you’re Alliance or Horde: You can queue for all wings of Uldir, Battle of Dazar’alor, Crucible of Storms, the Eternal Palace, and Ny’alotha, the Waking City. Some of the standout transmog items include Khor, Hammer of the Corrupted, Void-Binder, Glaive of the Keepers, Voror, Gleaming Blade of the Stalwart, Monstrosity’s Shipbreaker, Fang of the Behemoth, Stormtamer’s Orb. However, the G.M.O.D. doesn’t drop from Mekkatorque in LFR difficulty. If you’re looking for something a little different than the same old LFR, you can also solo queue for Island Expeditions, which offer plenty to collect. Both factions talk to the same NPC to queue for Legion LFR: in Legion Dalaran, speak to Archmage Timear, located just past the gates leading towards The Violet Hold. You can queue for all wings of The Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, The Nighthold, Tomb of Sargeras, and Antorous, the Burning Throne. Transmog weapon appearances are limited here since Legion was the Artifact expansion, but there are great armor sets. Tomb of Sargeras LFR sets are excellent for transmog, and Antorus has special weapon transmogs like Taeshalach and Scythe of the Unmaker. You can also get mounts such as the Abyss Worm and the Antoran Charhound. Queuing for LFR in Warlords of Draenor is extremely simple: you just queue from your Garrison. Both Alliance and Horde should look for Seer Kazal, close to their town hall. You can queue for all wings of Highmaul, Blackrock Foundry, and Hellfire Citadel. In Warlords, LFR difficulty raids didn’t drop recolored versions of the gear from higher difficulties: instead, LFR armor resembles PVP sets. But these raids still have some pretty cool looking items, such as the Greatsword of Chaos or Soulcult Ritual Staff. To solo queue for Mists of Pandaria LFR, both factions talk to Lorewaker Han in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, standing right next to Cho up at the top of Mogushan Palace. You can queue for all wings of Mogu’shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring, Throne of Thunder, and Siege of Orgrimmar. Mists was the first expansion to have LFR versions of every raid, and thus LFR versions of weapons and armor for transmog. And there’s quite a lot of really good transmog in these raids, more than I can really sum up: but standouts include Starshatter, Shin’ka, Execution of Dominion, Bo-Ris, Horror in the Night, and Iron Qon’s Boot Knife. There’s only one LFR difficulty raid in Cataclysm, and unlike later solo queues, you have to go directly to the raid entrance to queue for Dragon Soul. Just go to the raid entrance in the Caverns of Time and speak to Auridormi, the Raid Finder Guardian. Some nerfs have been made to Cataclysm raids to make them easier to solo — and collect some of those hard-to-find mounts. You can collect LFR-specific set recolors as well as some interesting weapons, such as Gurthalak. I actually think the LFR versions of these weapons are often better looking due to them having more cool off-tones like blue, like in the case of No-Kaled, the Elements of Death or the Maw of the Dragonlord. Neither Shadowlands nor Dragonflight allow you to solo queue for LFR yet, but Shadowlands will likely be added some time during the current expansion cycle. But you’ll have to wait longer for Dragonflight: don’t expect to be able to solo queue for it until the Midnight expansion. Still, there’s a lot of soloing to do (and transmog to collect) while we wait. So take heart, brave transmog addicts, not that we’re addicts and even if we are so what, it’s perfectly normal to run Dragon Soul LFR over and over and over again looking for a blue sword, don’t you judge me.

New York City's mayoral frontrunner is expected to be busy next week trying to convince the city's business leaders that he's the man for the job. Dozens of the city's business leaders are gearing up to talk with Zohran Mamdani, who clinched the Democratic nomination for mayor last month, in a series of closed-door meetings next week. The gatherings, scheduled for Tuesday, July 15, and Wednesday, July 16, in midtown Manhattan, were arranged by the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group. Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of Partnership for New York City, said about 100 CEOs are expected to attend Tuesday's gathering, to be cohosted by Rob Speyer, CEO of property investor and development firm Tishman Speyer, and Albert Bourla, CEO of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Wednesday's event will focus on leaders from the city's technology sector and is expected to be led by Kevin Ryan, founder and CEO of AlleyCorp, a venture capital firm, Wylde said. "They want to understand what his affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America really means," Wylde said of the 33-year-old self-described socialist who rattled business leaders when he defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Wylde did not specify where the meetings are expected to take place, citing concerns that it could draw protesters. Andrew Epstein, a spokesperson for Mamdani, didn't return a request for comment but last month told Bloomberg that the campaign had planned to meet with NYC's business leaders this month. Mamdani clinched the Democratic primary in a city that tends to vote blue on a platform that vowed to fix housing and other affordability issues plaguing the city's residents. He has pledged to build $100 billion of new affordable housing and offer free bus service and childcare. He has proposed a 2% tax on millionaires in the city to help pay for his agenda, although he would need approval from state legislators and the governor for any new levies. "They are concerned that his campaign focused on how to solve problems by raising taxes and spending more money," Wylde said. "Does he understand that New York is in a competitive position when it comes to jobs and private investment and that there is a point at which you can't get blood out of a stone?" The Partnership for New York City boasts some powerful members, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone, and David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. Speyer and Bourla are co-chairs of the business advocacy group's board. Some business leaders have said they won't be convinced of Mamdani's viability and have banded behind incumbent mayor Eric Adams in an effort to defeat the young political star in the general election this fall. "I fully support Eric Adams and I think others will too, based on people I'm speaking with," said Jared Epstein, a Manhattan real estate executive who co-hosted a fundraiser for Adams in Bridgehampton on Long Island over the July 4th weekend with John Catsimatidis, a wealthy former Republican candidate for NYC mayor. "Mamdani is in for a rude awakening if he thinks he's going to take this city." Adams was indicted last year by federal prosecutors for accepting gifts from a Turkish official and related businesspeople. The case was dropped by President Trump's Justice Department, but it inflicted damage on Adams's candidacy, according to polls. Jump to

Title: Peter Schiff Says Trump's Tax Cuts 'Won't Grow The Economy.' Instead, He Warns They'll Lead To Higher Interest Rates And Inflation

Economist and market commentator Peter Schiff is cautioning against President Donald Trump's latest tax and spending package, saying it could do more harm than good for the U.S. economy. A day after Trump signed the bill into law during a July 4 picnic at the White House, Schiff took to social media to argue that Trump's approach is flawed. "Trump’s tax cuts, which add to budget deficits, won’t grow the economy," Schiff posted on X. "Instead they’ll result in higher long-term interest rates and inflation." Don't Miss: According to Schiff, real growth comes from policies that boost supply, not just demand. "To grow an economy, tax cuts need to stimulate supply, not demand. They need to increase savings and investment, not consumer spending," he wrote. When one X user replied, "Consumer spending is what drives the economy," Schiff fired back, "Wrong, a productive economy enables consumers to spend." Schiff's warnings follow a wave of criticism from economists who believe the bill's impact on the federal deficit and inflation could be significant. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump's newly signed bill will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Some economists, including Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, say the U.S. was already on an “exploding debt path” even before this legislation. "It's like the house is burning down and we're throwing in some accelerant instead of some fire extinguisher," Smetters told ABC News on Friday. "We're not too big to fail." Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told ABC News that the bill “will make interest rates higher and makes the risks of falling into a doom loop higher than it would be otherwise.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now In addition to deficit concerns, the bill includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The CBO estimates it will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler called it "the worst job-killing bill in American history," saying it gives “a $5 trillion gift to the wealthy while stripping support from working families.” Despite the pushback, Trump has argued that stronger economic growth and tariff revenues will offset the cost of the legislation. “Our country is going to explode with massive growth … This bill sets us on course for enormous prosperity in the new and wonderful Golden Age of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on July 1. But many economists remain unconvinced. “Bond markets can be really, really disciplinary,” Smetters told ABC News. “If we fall into a doom loop, then the U.S. has to make dramatic cutbacks in federal benefit programs like Social Security and Medicaid and sharply raise taxes. That will be really bad for people’s standard of living.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Should You Invest In Bitcoin, ETFs, Or Bitcoin Treasury Companies?

ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. Bitcoin investors have a variety of options for gaining exposure. There Are No Solutions, Only Trade-Offs” - Thomas Sowell After many years of regulatory resistance to Bitcoin, the asset has now gained approval to enter into mainstream capital markets. Starting with the approval of spot BTC ETFs to trade on January 11, 2024, various legal wrappers for BTC exposure have emerged. Recently, a notable trend has emerged as public companies add BTC to their balance sheets. Many investors likely wonder how to get best involved with this complex set of options. There are no black-and-white answers to this, only trade-offs. In this article, we will break down the pros and cons of each. Real BTC Owning actual Bitcoin, held in a personally controlled wallet of your own custody, is the original form of owning Bitcoin. Much like owning a bar of gold in your house, this offers complete control over the asset. This was the original intent of Bitcoin, an asset independent of government control or centralized authority. If custodied properly, it can not be seized or hacked or, potentially, even known that you own it. Self-custody offers a double-edged sword for many. Properly custodying Bitcoin in cold storage can result in a complete loss of your investment if not done carefully. First, the private key can be lost and unrecoverable. This famously occurred to James Howells, who accidentally disposed of the private key to access 8000 BTC, worth over $850MM today. There is no back-up for self-custody. Just as if you lost a bar of gold, it can be lost forever with no recourse. With great power comes great responsibility. In addition, ease of access to cold storage Bitcoin means that transacting may be slow. The process of accessing, transferring, or selling Bitcoin can take hours or days, which may pose a problem for some. There are alternatives to this, but they essentially remove the benefit of owning BTC directly. This includes keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange, storing your private keys in a bank or with a lawyer, or using a private key device like a Ledger to store them. This decreases the odds of you losing your Bitcoin; it also removes the self-sovereign properties that make owning Bitcoin attractive and unique. You have to trust some other party or company to keep you secure. ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are legal wrappers that allow people to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin. They create a legal entity that holds the Bitcoin in custody on your behalf. The ETFs are regulated by the SEC and must abide by strict compliance, reporting, and security standards to be approved. This allows regular investors to make an investment in Bitcoin without having to deal with the technological peculiarities the asset poses. These ETFs are trading on major stock exchanges and can also be accessed by retirement accounts and large financial institutions that must abide by strict investment and regulatory policies. Though ETFs simplify ownership, they also neuter much of the unique protections Bitcoin can provide. You are depending on a large set of human beings to protect you. This includes the ETF creator, a firm like BlackRock or Fidelity, for example, the custodian, which is almost always Coinbase, the regulators, and market-making firms. Though all of these groups are regulated and legitimate, their incentives are not exactly aligned with every individual who wants to own bitcoin. Changes to policy, technical errors, hacks, and fraud can all arise when so many counterparties get involved. BTC Treasury Companies The latest wave of BTC exposure has come in the form of so-called Bitcoin Treasury Companies. These are public companies that hold Bitcoin rather than only USD. These vehicles offer many of the regulated protections and mainstream accessibility of an ETF and can be traded on exchanges, but add a variety of strategies and financial engineering approaches to aim to generate greater returns. These approaches can vary widely depending on the company. It can include selling more shares of stock into the market to raise more money, selling convertible debt, offering exposure across different jurisdictions in order to tap into untouched markets, trading the bitcoin using derivatives, taking out loans with the bitcoin to buy more bitcoin, and much more. For some jurisdictions, no ETF exists, and so a simple company that just buys and holds Bitcoin for shareholders may be the best option available. All of this adds another layer of human involvement to the risk of the investment. It can also mean much greater upside if chosen properly. Some of these companies trade at 10 times the value of the actual Bitcoin they hold. Though investors may be able to make more upside with BTC treasury companies, gaining exposure to intelligent strategies and retail buying momentum, they also have more risk. The same factors that can create outsized gains can create outsized losses. These are very sophisticated financial products that leverage aspects of retail speculation, debt instruments, marketing, and legal and jurisdictional arbitrage to, hopefully, outperform Bitcoin. Some of these strategies suffer from black swan-type risk, in which they will look to be doing very well until they suddenly fail. Others will be successful far out into the future. One important aspect to consider with BTC Treasury Companies is whether they are pure-play Bitcoin holding companies or does the Bitcoin complement other business activity and income. Companies that have real income may be better positioned in the long run for stability and risk management during times when the price of BTC falters, since they have other ways to pay bills and stay in business. Companies that are pure-play vehicles may have greater upside and volatility. In the end, all of these vehicles can make sense for different types of investors, from long-term individual holders to pension funds to day traders. It’s important to truly understand what the company does to generate a return for you so that you can evaluate risk with a clear perspective.

Sunak’s appointment comes after resigning from the PM role last year after a loss to Keir Starmer’s Labour Party Goldman Sachs has named former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. The investment bank announced Sunak’s appointment on Tuesday. Sunak, who remains a Conservative member of parliament from a seat in northern England, previously worked at Goldman as an analyst in the early 2000s before joining a series of hedge funds. Through a combination of his past career in financial services and the family wealth of his wife, whose father co-founded the Indian IT services company Infosys, Sunak became the wealthiest British prime minister, drawing criticism of being out of touch with most UK voters. He has remained largely out of the spotlight since resigning as leader of the Conservatives after the party’s worst defeat in more than a century in July last year. He took up posts at Oxford and Stanford universities earlier this year. Goldman’s hiring of Sunak, who had also served as the UK’s finance minister, adds to a long list of senior politicians taking up positions in finance, where their policy backgrounds and global networks are viewed as strategic assets. “I am excited to welcome Rishi back to Goldman Sachs,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. “In his role, he will work with leaders across the firm to advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape,” Solomon said. Former British finance ministers George Osborne and Sajid Javid have also made the move to finance with Osborne holding positions at asset manager BlackRock and advisory firm Robey Warshaw and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus.

The milestone comes just 18 months after the fund’s launch in January 2024, marking a rapid accumulation pace that has drawn industry-wide attention. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the achievement on July 8, noting that IBIT is now 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest known single holder of Bitcoin.

In addition to its growing Bitcoin holdings, IBIT has also become a top-performing revenue generator for BlackRock.

"Volatility may be on summer break, but Q3 and Q4 could still deliver fireworks," the analysts wrote in a recent blog post. The current low volatility is a sign that markets have priced in a Goldilocks scenario with delayed tariffs, rate cuts from the Federal Open Markets Committee later this year, and sustained fiscal deficits, the analysts wrote. "While whales, OGs, and miners largely sidelined, Bitcoin remains just 2 to 3 percent below all-time highs," they said. "This is supported by steady inflows from ETFs and public corporate treasuries." BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the Nasdaq under the IBIT ticker, has netted nearly $53 billion in inflows since its debut 18 months ago and just reached 700,306.7922 Bitcoin in its holdings. It has been the fastest-growing exchange-traded fund in the industry's 32-year history. That means that BlackRock holds 3.52% of the 19.8 million circulating supply of Bitcoin. And Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, noted that the company's iShares Ethereum Trust now holds 1.5% of all ETH. "If ETF inflows continue, we could be entering the early stages of a structural supply squeeze," he said. "That means less ETH circulating on the open market, more volatility, and stronger upward pressure on price." The QCP analysts also noted that equities are "extending their melt-up rally." At the time of writing, the S&P 500 was trading at $6,226.78—up 3.6% over the past month. And the Nasdaq 100 index has gained 4.2% over the same period. Both indexes have recently hit all-time highs. QCP analysts also noted that "credit spreads are the tightest they've been since the March-April correction." Credit spreads refer to the extra yield investors demand to hold riskier corporate bonds over safer government debt. For the spread to be especially narrow is a sign of investor confidence because they're not demanding much compensation for the credit risk. The real macro signal to watch will be whether President Donald Trump can get more trade deals signed before his new August 1 deadline. Risk assets, like Bitcoin, have largely taken the new tariff deadline in stride, QCP wrote, having come to expect blustery tariff rhetoric without action. "Should Trump decide to follow through, however, the impact would be materially anti-growth," the analysts said. "It would mark a true test for global risk resilience."

War in the Middle East, The Rothschilds. The Confidential Pentagon Memo: “Take Out 7 Countries… Finishing off Iran.” Resisting War By Robert J. Burrowes, July 07, 2025 All major political and economic structures and processes were created by the Global Elite over past centuries using their extensive network of partners, fronts, agents and employees, including those deeply embedded in what many refer to as the ‘Deep State.’ Video: The Worldwide Corona Crisis, Global Coup d’Etat Against Humanity. Michel Chossudovsky By Prof Michel Chossudovsky and Michelle Leduc Catlin, July 08, 2025 Destabilizing the social, political and economic structure of 190 sovereign countries cannot constitute a “solution” to combating the virus. But that was the imposed “solution” which was implemented in several stages from the very outset of the corona crisis in January 2020. It’s the destruction of people’s lives. It is the destabilization of civil society. Genocide in Palestine. Displacement as Negotiation: The Ever-Enduring Logic of Plan Dalet By Rima Najjar, July 08, 2025 Today, the world is witnessing the original logic of Zionist territorial consolidation in the Levant as it mutates but persists — like a serpent uncoiling through time, holding Plan Dalet in its forked tongue and injecting it with new poison. Militarism and Organized Crime: U.S. Neocolonialism and Mass Poverty. Stephen Sefton By Stephen Sefton, July 08, 2025 Currently, the year-on-year growth figures of the largest world economies show that the economies of China and India are growing by more than 5% while the North American economy is growing by 2% on a downward trend, Japan and the United Kingdom by less than 2% and countries such as France, Italy and Germany by less than 1%. Ukraine Transformed into an “Underdeveloped Country”: Why Did BlackRock Suddenly Give Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime By Drago Bosnic, July 08, 2025 When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. BRICS at Rio de Janeiro: And What Next? By Kester Kenn Klomegah, July 08, 2025 Popularly referred to as BRICS, the informal group of emerging-market economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), meeting in Rio de Janeiro, has outlined a new unprecedented multitude of goals to challenge unipolar system. In the context of rising uncertainty, BRICS has further set up new models to change the economic architecture through South-South cooperation. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — Salvation or Disaster? Neither or Both? By Richard C. Cook, July 07, 2025 The Trump administration has taken time out from its endless wars abroad to celebrate Independence Day here at home by President Trump’s signing of his “Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) to keep the government running for another year and to implement his MAGA priorities.

Title: Truth Social Goes Full Crypto—SEC Considers Trump-Linked ETF Filing

Time Published: 2025-07-08T15:00:55Z

US regulators have kicked off the formal review of a new spot‑crypto fund. Investors won’t know for sure if it clears the hurdles until the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes a final call. But the filing itself signals growing acceptance of directly held crypto products. According to the SEC filing, Trump Media’s Truth Social unit wants an ETF listed on NYSE Arca with 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ether. Yorkville America Digital would sponsor the fund, while Foris DAX Trust Company—Crypto.com’s custody arm—would hold the coins. US President Donald Trump’s team submitted the S‑1 form on June 16, starting what is likely a 45‑day review clock. Based on reports, the fund would value Bitcoin each trading day using the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate. Ether would use the CME CF Ether rate, unless the sponsor chooses another source. Private keys for both assets would sit in a cold wallet, kept separate from customer accounts. That setup aims to address long‑standing worries over hacks, theft and tangled custody failures. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have filed pure‑Bitcoin ETF applications. Some firms are eyeing Ether‑only funds. Now a dual‑asset product is in the mix. If the SEC finalizes its planned “automated” listing framework, reviews could shrink from many months to a few. That rule would standardize disclosures, custody standards and market‑integrity checks for all spot‑crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s spot‑Solana ETF hit another delay. The SEC pushed back its March 25 application and opened a new public‑comment window—21 days for feedback, 35 days for replies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called this hold‑up “expected,” noting it shows the agency is still fine‑tuning data and disclosures before any approvals. Now the ball is in the SEC’s court. Regulators can sign off, send back comments or reject the bid. If leadership keeps up the push for faster, automated reviews, spot‑crypto ETFs might reach market this year. Until then, every move—from amendment requests to public comments—will matter for funds backed by Bitcoin, Ether and beyond. At stake is more than branding. Fees, trading speed and trust in custody will shape which funds win big money. And sponsors will need muscle to stand out in a growing field of nearly 10 proposals. Investors should keep a close eye on filings and deadlines to know when to act. The race launched with Trump Media’s Truth Social filing, and it may well end—with approval or denial—under its banner. Truth Social’s entry has put a fresh spin on the push for regulated crypto products. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The fund raising would be by group companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Energy Solutions, they said. The companies will be tapping private equity firms and sovereign funds from the Middle East, the US and Canada and some of the investors could be existing bond holders in the group, the sources said. Separately, the group is also negotiating a loan amount of around ₹16,000 crore with Indian banks for its airport arm. This will most likely be finalised towards the end of the year, the sources said. It will be used for the next phase of expansion of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built in phases. The airport, which is tentatively scheduled to start operations around September this year, will be able to handle 20 million passengers and 0.5 million tonne cargo annually in the launch phase. When the project is complete it will be able to handle 90 million passengers and 3.2 million tonnes of cargo. Over the last six months the Gautam Adani-controlled conglomerate has raised funds from global asset managers and funds such as Blackrock and Apollo and also from its joint venture partner TotalEnergies. In January Adani Green raised $1.425 billion, through $1.125 billion infusion by the promoter group and $300 million from TotalEnergies. The purpose of this was for early redemption of bonds and for capital optimisation. In March Adani Green again refinanced a $1.06-billion construction facility for its renewable energy projects in Rajasthan. In June it raised $750 million in a private bond issuance to fund its cement expansion. The group, which is in a perpetual expansion, growth and acquisitive mode, regularly taps the global markets for its funding needs. The group has a target to spend around $100 billion over the next 6-7 years. Published on July 8, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Ukraine Transformed into Underdeveloped Country: Why BlackRock Suddenly Gave Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/blackrock-gave-up-neo-nazi-junta/5894166
Time Published: 2025-07-08T14:52:43Z
Full Content:
When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. While the socialist superstate certainly had its flaws, the legacy it left in former Ukraine has never been matched by any government since the latter’s “independence” in 1991. Namely, while the country had a massive industrial sector until then and a population of 52 million, mostly well-educated and working in various specialist fields (Soviet Ukraine was a scientific and industrial powerhouse no less than Russia itself), after 1991, all this collapsed for good. By the early 1990s, relatively prosperous Ukraine turned into an underdeveloped country with only a fraction of its Soviet-era scientific and industrial potential, selling mostly agricultural products and essentially serving as a cheap resource for the political West’s brutal (neo)colonial exploitation. By the mid-2010s, NATO fully hijacked the unfortunate country and turned it over to the Neo-Nazi junta that’s now effectively conducting genocide against Ukrainians themselves. Namely, the demographic collapse is so catastrophic that it’s highly likely there’s only half of Ukraine’s 1991 population in the country at this point. The suicidal war with Russia (its closest kin) continues, while the United States is now openly demanding whatever’s left of Ukrainian resources (with even this lost to Russian all-out advance across the frontlines). In fact, the situation is so bad that the infamous BlackRock, the world’s most exploitative (neo)colonial conglomerate, has actually given up on NATO-occupied Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, it suspended work on “a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund”, supposedly following President Donald Trump’s election win. Apparently, this prompted France to work on a replacement deal, with initial support from Germany, Poland and Italy. The report, published on July 5, further states that BlackRock ceased all efforts to “search for institutional investors in January”, effectively ending the planned $500 million fund that was intended to be secured from various Western governments, development grants and investment banks. In turn, another $2 billion from other private investors was also lost after they withdrew. The report also points out that the investment stopped due to “a lack of interest amid perceived uncertainty in Ukraine”. In other words, nobody wants to sink billions of dollars into an endemically corrupt mafia state run by Neo-Nazi goons in the middle of an unwinnable war with a military superpower nextdoor. Truly shocking. However, jokes aside, it doesn’t take an economic expert to understand that the most basic logic implies that nobody remotely sane would make that kind of investment. Worse yet, the notion of “perceived uncertainty” is even more laughable. Namely, as previously mentioned, the Russian military is now advancing on multiple fronts, meaning that this “uncertainty” is not a matter of perception, but an objective reality that any thinking investor would take into account. The Bloomberg report further states that the investment fund was scheduled to be unveiled at the “Ukraine Recovery Conference” on July 10-11 in Rome. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the conglomerate “completed advisory work for the recovery fund pro bono in 2024, but no longer has any active mandate”. Worse yet, although France promised to “step up”, it seems this is also falling through. Citing “people familiar with the matter” Bloomberg reports that “it remains uncertain how effective the plan will be without American backing”. In other words, investors from the European Union are just as skeptical as their US counterparts, which tends to happen when people are getting their information from sources other than the mainstream propaganda machine which still insists that the Kiev regime is “defeating Russia”. Numerous independent authors from around the world (particularly at InfoBRICS), have been reporting that the so-called minerals deal that the Trump administration was trying to push for since it came to power would fall through. We repeatedly argued that the minerals promised by the Neo-Nazi junta weren’t even under its control, while areas with any known resources lack the mining industry to support extraction. It would take years and tens (if not hundreds) of billions in investment just to establish it. In other words, the investors would need to give lots of money to the losing side. Expectedly, such business deals are wholly unattractive to people who don’t like losing massive financial assets. The Kiev regime tried to do everything in its power (effectively selling the entire country) to change their opinions, but to no avail. For instance, the Neo-Nazi junta frontman Volodymyr Zelensky pompously announced his $1 trillion “reconstruction plan” years ago, even promising each corporation what can only be described as free rei(g)n in oblasts (regions) they invested in. The results have been catastrophic for NATO-occupied Ukraine, with around 30% of its arable land handed over to (neo)colonialists. In addition, cheap Ukrainian agricultural products flooded European markets (after they were initially promised to starving Africans and for which Russia was blamed by the mainstream propaganda machine), resulting in massive protests by farmers across the “old continent” as their market share collapsed virtually overnight. However, even this turned out to be a bad investment, particularly after the Russian military entered the Dnepropetrovsk oblast. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Goldman Sachs hires former British PM Sunak as adviser
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0708/1522481-goldman-sachs-hires-former-british-pm-sunak-as-adviser/

Full Content:
Goldman Sachs has today named former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak its senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. For Sunak, the appointment marks a return to the bank where he first worked as a summer intern in investment banking in 2000 and later as an analyst between 2001 and 2004. "In his role, he will advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape," Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. The move underscores a well-established career trajectory in which former government officials often transition to finance, where their policy background and global network are seen as strategic assets. Former Chancellors of the Exchequer George Osborne and Sajid Javid also moved into the industry, with Osborne joining BlackRock as an adviser and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus. Currently, banks are placing even greater value on such experience as they seek to guide clients through an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Sunak was the UK's prime minister between October 2022 and July 2024, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from February 2020 to July 2022.

Business FILE PHOTO: People walk outside the Nasdaq Marketsite in New York City, U.S., April 3, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo ReserveOne, a new crypto venture with ties to industry veterans and a former U.S. commerce secretary, will list on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank-check firm M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp and is expected to raise more than $1 billion. The company will manage a portfolio of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and Solana, while aligning its holdings with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve, it said on Tuesday. The deal, expected to close in the October-December quarter, is the latest in a series of efforts to wrap crypto assets into equity and make them more appealing for traditional investors. The exponential stock price growth of Michael Saylor's Strategy, which pivoted to a bitcoin-focused business model in 2020, has also popularized the playbook.
