BlackRock managed to land on the Financial Conduct Authority's tough crypto register on Tuesday, the regulators website showed. The world's biggest asset manager will be allowed to act as an arranger for iShares Digital Assets AG, which issue Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) — a financial instrument that is pegged an underlying asset, in this case a crypto asset. Registration on the U.K.'s crypto register is not an easy feat. The FCA's crypto register was set up in 2020 to ensure that crypto firms wishing to serve U.K. clients could only do so after they had registered to comply with the country's anti-money laundering rules. The U.K. has received 368 applications but only 51 firms have been approved. As an arranger, BlackRock will be able to "arrange the execution of transactions in cryptoassets to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions" between issuers and authorized participants but it will not be able to onboard any new customers. Also, it will not be able to operate a machine that "utilizes automated processes to exchange cryptoassets for money" vice versa - without written consent from the regulator. BlackRock joins the likes of crypto exchange Coinbase who recently managed to get on the register this year, though a new crypto regime awaits.

ByJabari Young ByJabari Young, Forbes Staff. Aliko Dangote, the wealthiest person in Nigeria, firmly believes in the phrase “seeing is believing.” Even after years of amassing his fortune, he sought additional confirmation of his wealth. To verify this, he drove to a bank on his own, wrote himself a check for $10 million, then cashed it. “I went home and opened it,” Dangote recalled in a 2019 interview. “I looked at $10 million (in cash) and I said, ‘Now I believe I have money.’–I took it back to the bank the next day.” Now if Dangote wanted to make a withdrawal, the banks might run out of cash before he does. On Tuesday, Forbes released the annual World’s Billionaires list. Dangote, the founder and CEO of the Dangote Group, the largest conglomerate in West Africa, ranks as the 83rd-richest person—and the richest Black person—on the planet. He’s worth an estimated $23.9 billion, up from $13.4 billion on last year’s list after nearly doubling his fortune with the opening of Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery. The $23 billion project converted a Nigerian marshland into the seventh-largest refinery in the world. Among the challenges of converting a jungle were moving 365 million cubic meters of sand from the sea, building a private port and private roads, and booking a 5,000-ton crane, one of only three in the world, years in advance. “It was the biggest risk of my life,” Dangote told Forbes in a February 2024 profile. “If this didn’t work, I was dead.” Dangote is the richest Black billionaire, but he isn’t the only one. Overall, there are a record 3,028 billionaires on this year’s ranking, worth a record $16.1 trillion combined. Twenty-three of them are Black—just 0.8% of the list—but they’re a wealthy and impressive bunch. Overall, these 23 have amassed $96.2 billion in wealth, mainly from the finance, energy and technology sectors. David Steward, an American IT entrepreneur, is the second richest, worth an estimated $11.4 billion. Private equity billionaire Robert F. Smith is the third-wealthiest Black billionaire, with an estimated net worth of $10.8 billion. Palantir Technologies cofounder and CEO Alexander Karp ($8.4 billion) and Nigerian businessman Mike Adenuga ($6.8 billion) round out the top five. Sheila Johnson, the cofounder of BET, is a new Black billionaire this year, as is Herriot Tabuteau, the founder of a biotech firm focused on brain disorders. NBA Sixth Man Junior Bridgeman was also poised to debut. Bridgeman amassed an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion before his untimely death in March. He would’ve joined four other Black athletes on the list who became billionaires: Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tiger Woods. “He didn’t waste his time just thinking about the game of basketball,” James told Forbes in February when discussing Bridgeman. “He’s always had a business mindset.” Michael Prince for Forbes The founder and CEO of Dangote Group began the painful process of building Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery in 2013. After 11 years, $23 billion in investment and innumerable headaches, the Dangote Refinery finally began operating in early 2024, helping boost Dangote’s fortune by $10.5 billion since last year’s list. The richest Black American cofounded World Wide Technology, which provides IT solutions to customers like Citi and Verizon, in 1990. He still serves as chairman of the private company, which now has nearly 10,000 employees and generates $20 billion in annual revenue. Smith founded $100 billion (assets under management) Vista Equity Partners, the largest Black-owned private equity firm in the United States, in 2000. He still runs the firm, which has more than 700 employees and focuses exclusively on investing in software companies. Karp is the cofounder and CEO of Palantir Technologies, a data mining company whose customers include the FBI, the Department of Defense and other government agencies. Palantir went public in 2020 and now has a market capitalization of nearly $200 billion. Adenuga made his first $1 million at age 26 as a commodities trader. Now he is one of the richest people in Africa thanks to his mobile phone network, Globacom, and his oil exploration outfit, Conoil. Abdulsamad Rabiu is the founder of BUA Group, a Nigerian conglomerate active in cement production, sugar refining and real estate. He launched the company 1988 and still serves as chairman and CEO. Through his foundation, the Abdul Samad Rabiu Initiative, he also supports education, health and social development projects across Africa. Often considered the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. His salary during his career totaled $90 million, but he has earned more than $2.4 billion (pretax) from such corporate partners as Nike, Hanes and Gatorade. In 2023, Jordan sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets in a deal that valued the NBA franchise at $3 billion. Today, he is one of just four Black Americans on The Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people. Motsepe is the founder and chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, a diversified mining and minerals company with operations in South Africa and Malaysia. In 2008, he became the first Black African on the World’s Billionaires list. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Her hit talk show ran for 25 years, until 2011, and she reinvested the profits from the program and films such as The Color Purple and Selma into a media and business empire. In 2011, she launched cable channel OWN and sold most of her stock toWarner Bros. Discovery in 2020. One of the greatest hip-hop musicians of all-time, Jay-Z has won 25 Grammys and launched multiple businesses, including the fashion brand Rocawear (which sold for $204 million in 2007) and alcohol lines D'Usse and Armand de Brignac. In 2019, he became hip-hop’s first billionaire. A native of Nigeria and now a U.S. citizen, Ogunlesi is the founding partner, chairman and CEO of New York-based private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). In October, GIP was acquired by BlackRock for $12.5 billion in cash and shares. Following his retirement from the NBA in 1996, Johnson began investing, opening movie theaters and Starbucks franchises, often in Black communities. The majority of his fortune comes from a 60% ownership stake in life insurance company Equitrust, which has grown from $16 billion in assets under management to $27 billion since he took over in 2015. Johnson also owns small equity stakes in four sports teams, including the NFL’s Washington Commanders and the reigning World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Otedola made his first fortune in commodities before selling his shares in Forte Oil to invest in the energy business. Today, he is the chairman and majority owner of Geregu Power, a power generation business, whose other investors include the Nigerian government and the State Grid Corporation of China. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Awotona moved to Atlanta when he was 15, and studied computer science at the University of Georgia before switching majors to business and management information. In 2013, he founded Calendly, a scheduling software startup, which private investors valued at $3 billion in 2021. Perry, who has built a platform as the second highest-paid TV showrunner, achieved billionaire status in 2020. He is best known for his "Madea" movie franchise, which has grossed more than $660 million. He also owns a quarter of the streaming platform BET+ and a 330-acre studio in Atlanta. Getty Images Over the course of his golf career, Woods has won 15 major championships (second only to Jack Nicklaus), 82 PGA Tour tournaments (tied for first with Sam Snead) and has won more prize money ($122 million) than any player in PGA history. However, the majority of Woods’ earnings have come from his lucrative brand deals, most famously with Nike. Born Robyn Fenty in Barbados—Rihanna is her middle name—she became a billionaire thanks to her cosmetics company, Fenty Beauty, which she co-owns with the French luxury conglomerate LVMH. Ibrahim founded Celtel International, one of the first mobile phone companies serving Africa and the Middle East, in 1998. Seven years later, he sold Celtel to Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Company for $3.4 billion and pocketed $1.4 billion. Since then, he's focused on fighting corrupt leadership in Africa through the Mo Ibrahim Foundation In 2022, James became the first active basketball player to become a billionaire, having earned more than $900 million (pretax) from endorsements and business ventures. James is a 21-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA champion, and four-time NBA MVP. Masiyiwa founded Econet Group in 1993 and built it into a telecom conglomerate with operations and investments throughout Africa, South America and Asia. He still serves as chairman of the company and also sits on the boards of the Gates Foundation and Netflix. Lee-Chin made his money investing in financial institutions including the National Commercial Bank Jamaica and AIC Limited. He sold AIC to Canadian financial services group Manulife in 2009 for an undisclosed price, but still owns 60% of National Commercial Bank Jamaica, which accounts for nearly half his fortune. A newcomer to this year’s list, Tabuteau founded Axsome Therapeutics in 2012 with the goal of developing life-changing treatments for the millions of patients living with brain disorders. He owns 15% of Axsome, which he took public in 2015. Prior to founding the company, Tabuteau worked in healthcare finance, including as a partner at hedge fund Healthco/S.A.C. Capital. Getty Images Another newcomer to this year’s list, Johnson cofounded cable network BET with her then-husband, Robert Johnson, in 1979, and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001. Now, she’s the founder of hospitality firm the Salamander Collection, which operates hotels and resorts in Washington, D.C., Charleston and Jamaica, among other destinations. Through her investment in Monumental Sports & Entertainment, she also owns stakes in the WNBA's Washington Mystics, the NBA's Washington Wizards and the NHL's Washington Capitals.

Title: The Trump ‘Threat’ Helps Sell the War Racket in Canada and Europe

Full Content:
Back at the end of February, we wondered how the Trump administration officials dressing down of the Europeans would mix with the relentless propaganda against Russia — specifically whether it would lead to a rally-around-the-EU-flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. That process is now in full swing and not just in Europe, but Canada too. Support for these EU and Canadian “rearmament” initiatives are being aided along by all the Trump noise. I say noise for the following reasons: Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund tells the New York Times the following. “The advent of the Trump administration has given history a shove,” he said. “We’re not in a linear environment, with a linear spending trajectory.” That same New York Times report mentions — as have many others — the Trump administration still supports NATO, plans to keep the American nuclear umbrella over Europe and remains committed to “collective defense.” In the SignalGate messages, VP Vance laments “I just hate bailing Europe out again.” Vance argued that bombing the Houthis to protect trade routes through the Suez Canal would benefit Europe much more than the US since only “3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez” and “40 percent of European trade does.” Well, that assumes that the US will be successful in “protecting” trade routes by bombing Yemen — which is far from a sure thing. And the US war crimes there are much more about bailing out Israel than Europe. Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” Vance was also miffed that the “bailing out” of Europe goes against Trump’s “message” about the EU. Even though Vance and Hegseth might be disappointed (that European nations aren’t bombing Yemen?), Trump’s “message” is still accelerating long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as the following: Now some EU plans look like they’re going nowhere fast. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s 800 billion “ReArm Europe” brainchild doesn’t have the full support of bloc countries it needs. And others from High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas to provide up to 40 billion euros in aid to Kiev and 5 billion euros toward providing Ukraine two million artillery shells this year are all but dead. That being said, several EU countries are dramatically increasing military spending, most notably Germany, which under incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz is losing its debt rules to spend big on its military. And the EU, even if “ReArm” never takes off, there are plenty of other options on the table. EU cohesion funds are financed by bloc governments in order to strengthen the economic, social and territorial unity of the EU through environment, transportation, and other infrastructure projects. Roughly one-third of the current seven-year EU budget of 1.2 trillion euros was for cohesion, but can now be used for defense. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is being pushed to direct more money and its AAA credit rating towards militarization. In 2022, the EIB began funding for dual-use projects, and the portion of lending going towards mitigating climate change or fostering economic growth has steadily declined as more money goes to Ukraine and military projects, but it is still unable to directly fund the production of arms and ammunition — something that helps it preserve that AAA rating. Most bloc countries are pushing for that to change. The Polish government recently announced that it will redirect 7.2 billion euros from its share of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds towards militarization spending. It’s the first — but perhaps not the last — bloc country to do so. None of these plans deal with the issue of the EU’s lack of soldiers and dearth of young men willing to enlist nor with the fact that even prior to Project Ukraine, NATO already massively outspent Russia on defense, yet the dramatic redirection of money from social spending to weapons companies continues nonetheless. It’s easy to see the dynamic at work here. Trump demands five percent of GDP spent on defense. NATO members go to 3.5 percent — a significant back-breaking jump from two percent. Ursula aims for 800 billion, but instead cohesion funds and EIB spending is redirected. And the more the Trump administration kicks the EU around, the more militarization initiatives in Europe gain support. That’s also the product of years of anti-Russia propaganda. One feels the table is set for the next manufactured crisis to go for broke. They’ve already got people taking to the streets to demand it. The People Want War? How genuine or realistic the Trump administration’s efforts are to end the war in Ukraine are debatable, and conclusions often change by day. (And let’s not forget Russia has the ultimate say.) But one thing is certain: just by making noise about peace in Ukraine and leaving Europe to fend for itself, Trump has helped sell European militarization spending. Here’s a piece from the Associated Press, “Tens of thousands join pro-Europe rally in Rome, amid worries over European Union’s plan to rearm.” This is in Italy, one of the least supportive publics in Europe for Project Ukraine with major class divergence on the benefits of EU membership, so that gives you an idea of the crowd likely skewed, but still. Tens of thousands of Italians joined a pro-Europe rally in Rome’s city center Saturday, waving blue European Union flags in a sign of support and unity as a European push for rearmament divides the country. The initiative, supported by most of the center-left opposition parties, despite their different positions, was launched by Italian journalist Michele Serra at the end of February, with an editorial in the Italian daily La Repubblica titled: “Let’s say something European.” “I wanted to organize a large demonstration of citizens supporting Europe, its unity and its freedom, with no party flags, only European flags,” Serra said, launching the slogan: “Here we make Europe, or we die.” The initiative was born in response to U.S. President Donald Trump ’s destabilizing policies, which created an unprecedented rift between Europe and the U.S., strained over the war in Ukraine and an ongoing tariff battle. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has reluctantly backed an EU plan to rearm Europe over concerns that the proposal by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen might weigh on Italy’s giant debt, diverting much-needed funds to weapons spending. Depending on where you sit, getting 30,000 out to protest for weapons manufacturers profits and the gutting of social services could be considered either an impressive or depressing achievement. Nevertheless, is it representative of the wider mood? A few recent polls have some interesting findings. Eurofound shows a slight reversal in the trend of European publics souring on Project Ukraine: A more extreme case of Trump-inspired EU militarization fever can be found in bloc’s recent Eurobarometer survey. The poll, conducted for the European Parliament in January and February, found that 74 percent of EU citizens thought their country benefited from EU membership. That’s the highest recorded level since the question was first asked in 1983. Why are people feeling the love for Brussels? Because the EU “strengthens security”: There’s also this: As always, these results should be taken with a grain of salt since it’s in the EU interest for citizens to support more centralization in the name of “protection.” And so the results are also interesting for what the EP chose to emphasize and subsequent media reports chose not to highlight, including the following: Or how about the following? Most of those values are under threat from the EU, not by any outside forces. While they might have gotten numbers they craved on “the role of the EU to protect,” the increased support for Brussels comes despite the realization beginning to break through that life will not be getting any better: That will no doubt still be the case even once the Trump shock is gone and the rally around the flag euphoria wears off — just as it did following the start of Russia’s special military operation in 2022. Neoliberal Warmongers’ Reprieve One area the Trump effect is more clearly showing itself is in bumps of support for Western politicians and parties thoroughly discredited for their Project Ukraine support in recent years and the disastrous effect it has had on economies at home. Here’s FT: Canada’s ruling Liberal party was facing a humiliating loss in upcoming elections. Then came Donald Trump. Party leadership contenders vied to display strength against the US president, his tariffs and his desire to take over Canada – and Liberals’ poll ratings began surging. Under new prime minister Mark Carney, with the slogan “Canada strong”, the party is now narrow favourite to win a historic fourth straight term. The former Bank of England governor has become emblematic of global leaders enjoying a ratings bump after going head to head with Trump. Polling in several countries, from Mexico to Ukraine, shows even unpopular leaders like France’s Emmanuel Macron are enjoying some relief from voters as they seek to ward off menaces including tariffs, the withdrawal of military support and even the threat of US conquest. Even Zelesnky, who has Ukraine on the verge of extinction, has got wind in his sails: Zelenskiy’s overall approval rating has shot to 67 per cent while his net approval is 38 per cent – the highest scores since December 2023 – even as he seeks to mend relations by accepting Trump’s proposed minerals deal and partial 30-day truce. Trump’s comments were seen as “unfair, a stab in the back” and “a wider attack on the country, rather than just criticism targeting the president”, said Anton Hrushevsky of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Macron is going to need a lot more help (like, say, the barring of his main rival from office), but he’s up six percentage points to a depressing 27 percent in an Elabe survey this month. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer who’s even more impressive than Macron in that he sunk to similar approval levels in a fraction of the time, saw a double digit rise in approval rating as the UK public rallies around the Starmer slime in the face of what they view as Trump’s unfair treatment of Ukraine. Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome’s Institute for International Affairs told FT the following: “You have this bully that is smashing the system. Rather than just kissing the ring, these leaders basically stand up and politely say ‘no’, and their voters appreciate the fact that they are not being colonised.” But is that really true? Beneath the Surface It’s Business As Usual Europe still refuses to do anything about the energy elephant in the room and despite all the big talk remain mostly subservient to the US. Canadians might be flying the maple leaf everywhere you look, but how’s that surge of patriotism playing out in Ottawa? Canada is in talks to get in on the EU’s increased military spending. Brussels says it wants to prioritize European-made products, but there are doubts about that. According to the Stockholm International Peace Institute: Arms imports by European states were 94 per cent higher in 2019–23 and 55 percent came from the US, a substantial increase from 35 per cent in 2014–18. The next largest suppliers to the region were Germany and France, which accounted for 6.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent of imports, respectively. The EU, as part of the Trump spat, is looking to reduce that dependence and is hoping on Canada. According to the New York Times, “Canada, according to the terms of the discussion, would also be given preferential access to the E.U. market for military equipment, an alternative to buying equipment from the United States.” There are issues there, as well: Canada’s military industry, which is relatively small, has been used to produce Canadian equipment but has also been a regular contractor for building American military equipment or parts. Canadian factories across the vast country produce munitions, tanks, aircraft, technological defense systems and navy ships. An in-depth industry review in 2022 found that about half of Canada’s military equipment was exported and half kept domestically. The top export destination, by far, was the United States. In the meantime, Ottawa is sending billions to one of Canada’s wealthiest families in the name of defense. From The Breach: The Liberal government has handed $8 billion to one of Canada’s wealthiest families—and they’re counting on Canadians not to notice. The deal awards Irving Shipbuilding, owned by the notorious Irving dynasty, a six-year contract to start building three new destroyers for the Canadian navy. Even military insiders have slammed it as wildly overpriced. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039—and by then, the total cost will have ballooned to at least $22 billion. The government boasted the deal will help protect Canada’s sovereignty and create jobs. But at a time when Canadians are struggling with the cost of living, a crumbling healthcare system, and a planetary crisis, it’s clear what this really is: a massive corporate handout in disguise. An enormous grift? Sure, but it must be done due to Trump’s threats to Canada’s national security. Canada is spending another $6 billion to develop an Arctic radar detection system — again part of the US desire to militarize the region, which European countries like Sweden, Finland, and Norway are also helping with. The UK just announced it’s going forward with buying more F-35s despite all the supposed worries about a Trump kill switch. Canada, too, has yet to cancel its purchase of 88 F-35s costing more than $14 billion — although Ottawa says it’s “doing its homework.” To make it abundantly clear where these governments priorities are, these massive expenditures come as the UK slashes benefits for those with disabilities (and won’t even make a document describing the cuts available to blind people set to have support slashed), and Canada offers more support for the disabled to die than to live. And incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz touts his plans for further cuts to Bürgergeld and other social spending as Germany authorises 1 trillion euros in new loans for militarization. Canada and the EU continue to do the empire’s bidding against the likes of China and Iran and play along in Syria and elsewhere. The Italian-owned Mediterranean Shipping Company is working with the Trump administration and Blackrock to take over a portion Middle East shipping infrastructure — a big part of the US strategy to reverse the tide of China’s growing control over global logistics. Ottawa is engaging in its own trade war against Beijing, which is approved of by Washington. The EU is making noise about rapprochement with China, but there has been no movement yet, and many in Brussels are offering to get even tougher on Beijing as a way to please the US. Meanwhile, there’s still no peace with Russia as the Atlanticists enact what have been their goals all along — primarily other members of NATO spending a lot more. As Politico put it, “One imagines that Trump administration officials are patting themselves on the back for finally getting the Germans to take more drastic action on defense spending, meeting a long-time goal of many U.S. administrations to strengthen the European pillar of the transatlantic alliance.” Yes, there have been calls for this for years, and they ramped up considerably after the beginning of Russia’s SMO. Here is just one example from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing last year in Foreign Affairs about Washington’s need to focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. It might be a stretch to say it’s all part of a coordinated plot, but while the increase in military spending might be coming amid a war of words — and some tariffs — the Atlanticist think tanks funded by and expressing the will of American plutocrats are getting what they wanted — and in some cases even more. ‘War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.’ . – George Orwell Aye. The solution to Capitalist overproduction; the MMT Jobs Guarantee. Along with the warnings from Brian Berletic’s New Atlas series, this observation early in Conor’s grim review reminds us ” long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as…: The crushing of the welfare states in Europe and Canada, which goes hand-in-hand with… Rearmament. Ultimately, the benefits of rearmament go first and foremost to the Western arms companies.” Just as 70 years of economic hostility tries to crush Cuba’s exemplary welfare state, reckless warfare and economic policies elsewhere send waves of refugees across the Mediterranean to Europe, crashing welfare states and turning people against their own compassionate policies. While 1960 subtracted from 2025 does come to “only” 65 years of economic warfare, the campaign seems to be baked into Washington’s dream of an economic overthrow – for the foreseeable future – unless and until US politics can be reshuffled. This whining reminds me of something: ‘Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”’ Which is: Nothing like U.S. macho guys (and macho ladies) sniveling. When was the last time any of them asked what military bases and weapons programs are truly needed, and which are just the usual U.S. boondoggles and displays of dominance? And let’s recall the division of Europe and other little inconveniences like the division of Berlin and Gorizia. The Americans can let the leases lapse on Ghedi and Aviano. The demo organized by Michele Serra has come in for criticism for not standing for anything. Europe? Values? The word “valori” is being thrown around here in Italy these days, and I note that in the graph on values the most-voted value by the populace is peace. Oh. Maybe the social state? Italians are fully aware that after thirty years of stagnant wages the Rearm EU thingy, now called Readiness!, is guaranteed to lower Italian wages further. Five Stars (supported by AVS = Sinistra + Greens) is organizing a demo for 5 April in Roma. We will see how it goes. This is a straight-out anti-rearmament, pro-peace demonstration, rather than oooshy values-waving. As a preliminary, the CGIL and ARCI are backing a demo today here in the Chocolate City. I will walk over to the Piazza Castello later to see what’s what. As to quoting Nathalie Tocci. Foul play, Conor Gallagher! She’s a turbo-Atlanticist who sure loves those wars (as so many lady warmongers do) and regular in the propaganda-laden front pages of La Stampa. Who’s next? Pina Picierno? Say it ain’t so, Joe. On quoting Tocci: It didn’t feel great doing it, but what a perfect encapsulation of the dynamic at play. Aurelien’s observation in his most recent essay: “Take, by way of contrast, roles traditionally attributed to men and women in times of crisis and war. From the earliest times, men were expected to fight, and if necessary die, whilst women encouraged them to do so. (The “women as peacemakers” meme was commercially successful for a while, but as the example of Frau von der Leyen shows, nature generally reverts to type.) Men were biologically more dispensable than women, and indeed, once they had fathered the replacement number of surviving children, their future was of less importance anyway.” https://aurelien2022.substack.com/p/being-non-transactional On needs only to look at Naked Capitalism’s Not-So-Cold-War section each day to see a trajectory of events, and future “peace” Russia faces. Even Dima at Military Summary is saying Trump 720 degrees is/needs to find more military funding of Ukraine in the future beyond Biden’s last formal request to Congress so as to keep “diplomatic” pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Because “peace”. While Dima isn’t so good at interpreting US politics he is somewhat a bell weather and words things broadly if not always correctly. I’ve never been comfortable with the framing of Russia “winning the war but losing the peace.” The peace we see the West preparing for, a constant, long range, never ending war and accelerated construction of huge US miliary bases in Romania with nukes pointed directly at Russia, that we see everyday at Not So Cold War? Very good overview of the current situation. Here in Canada I think it is best to keep in mind Cockburn’s quip that you can only believe a politician when he/she denies whatever is at hand. Or in other words, when they say they are telling the truth you know they are lying. If they say it did not happen, then it really did happen. In Canada focusing on Trump and tariffs has been a godsend to the Liberals in the current election. 10 years of lacklustre minimal change in social benefits (dental care, daycare and pharmacare), the Liberals have structured these concrete improvements in people’ lives to take years to actually be meaningful for most of the population. I am cognizant that these social advances in the US would be revolutionary and maybe only legislated into practice after an overthrow of the current constitution. As to armaments and Canada participating in Europe and with Europe keep in mind that this document “NORAD modernization project timelines Fact sheet: NORAD modernization project timelines” dictates down to the size of a screw and where and how it will be used and this policy welds Canada to the US MIC and US foreign policy. Buying European arms means that Canada would have to integrate these weapons, etc. with the US MIC. Now how likely is that. If anything Canada is Trojan Horse for the US to maintain its hegemony in worldwide weapons specs and production. As to the Canadian election, Pierre “Skippy” Poilièvre’s best and only asset in Conservative circles is that he is really angry. And , and a big and, comes across as really authentic, but for the electorate there are no feasible or practical solutions being proposed to make people’s lives better. In Canada we have been living in a neoliberal hell run by Tweedledum and Tweedledummer at least since I have been old enough to vote (circa 1980). Whether you vote Team Red or Team Blue it doesn’t matter — it’s always neoliberal cola in every bottle. What few tiny improvements in social welfare that have been achieved since the ‘60s have mostly come when the Liberals are forced to include the New Democrats (NDP) in a minority parliament, so I suppose I can extend that meagre hope … Today’s NDP is a neoliberal party. Their much-touted dental plan, besides being confusing, is neither universal nor public. It’s not universal, because (a) dentists can opt out, and (b) anyone whose employer offers benefits is disqualified–even if a particular employee doesn’t actually receive those benefits. It’s not really public, because the system is managed by Sun Life. What’s worse, this plan exposes Canada’s health care system to attack under our various trade treaties. Now that a private firm can bid for health care management contracts, Canada could be sued to open the sector to competition. In other words, this dental program does NOT represent an extension of social welfare. Instead, it’s the fatal chink in the armour, that might doom universal public health insurance in Canada. But what else would you expect, from the government now headed by the typical guy from Goldman Sachs? “Smart” policy, as we like to say nowadays. And it couldn’t have happened without the NDP. I’m pleased you worked “Racket” into your title, Conor. Sadly too little has changed since Smedley Butler’s time. Against what threat does Europe rearm? Russia? It does carry on hysterically about Russia, doesn’t it? I say again, against what threat does Europe rearm? We are in Smedley Butler”s wheel house. War is a racket. The MIC are racketeers. Lindsey Graham revealed it. Ukraine is the best kind of war. Profits with little to none of “our blood.” Lindsey is a racketeer and a cheer leader for racketeering. He is one voice in a crowd of racketeers in the DC Bubble & Echo Chamber stuffing their pockets with the largesse of the MIC. It is all so stupid, so disingenuous, so callous, so self-serving, so calculating. Throw the bums out. Which bums you ask? Really? You cannot be serious. I note that Europe has a very long history of using its arms on its neighbors centuries before there was ever a military-industrial complex. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039 By then Yemen will probably have domestic hypersonic production. Grift is an understatement. The problem with such short-term shenanigans is that they exacerbate the long-term problems that necessitate them. I haven’t seen any indication that the eurocracy has any appreciation or even an understanding of just what is driving the overall souring of the public mood and the rise of far-right populism. These are going to accelerate as the graft of Rearm Europe further concentrates wealth and resources into fewer hands. re: German incompetence in security affairs If anyone wants to read yet another document which offers proof of the utter incompetence of German “elites” to seriously change course read this 2-pager (German but quickly translatable.). Signed by some of the 15 best known “doves” in security affairs. STATEMENT “RATIONAL SECURITY POLICY INSTEAD OF ALARMISM,” March 30, 2025 Rational security policy instead of alarmism https://johannes-varwick.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Final__Rationale_Sicherheitspolitik.pdf “(…) Russia is undoubtedly a threat to European security, and aggressive intentions beyond Ukraine cannot be completely ruled out – although hybrid threats are more plausible than traditional military ones. However, a sober look at Russia’s economic and military capabilities, as well as its (realizable) intentions, reveals little evidence that Russia could or even would want to engage NATO militarily and attack its territory. A Russia that has great difficulty achieving its goals in Ukraine is a manageable military threat. Furthermore, NATO is, and will remain so for the foreseeable future, disproportionately stronger than Russia in virtually all military respects. (…) Without a reliable American security guarantee, Europe must reposition its security policy. (…)” Some of the signatories most likely are the same who early 2023 in a peace memo on Ukraine argued that the war had so far cost 50.000 civilians´ lives – because the US Armed Forces had told them so – ??? What else do you need for proof for the insanely low level we are operating here. The letter´s intention I fully agree with. But that is seriously high school level. Since the alternative would be another 30 years war or WWIII. But not this way. Which is void of any real professional insight into the matter of security. The 15 individuals who have signed in private might have certain more far-reaching expertise that would matter to this public statement. But the major thrust as presented here beyond any doubt shows you that: 1) These laughably compromising formulations are a lip service at best without any force behind them. 2) There is no substantive understanding of how military affairs have changed on the tactical and the strategic level. 3) No substantial consequences will be drawn – such as ending NATO, cancelling MDF as of 2026, cancelling F-35s, a non-nuclear European zone in conjunction with RU as laid out by RU in Dec. 2021 So part and parcel of this mindset is 1) Russia is weak because they “struggle” in Ukraine to reach their objectives (seriously???!). 2) NATO-Europe so goddam strong. 3) Russia might pose some danger. All of this makes it obvious that there is NO – and I repeat this here – NO hope for German elites and thus German public at large to resist meaningfully the sell-out via new war budget and thereof destruction of this society. If even those who are allegedly the experts (which they obviously are not at least as public statements go) fail to take a decisive position which would be the only position to open a new path towards Russia and BRICS then WHO should? Since none of this would stop Merz or anybody else for real. So if I despair this is one major reason, why. I love it. A classic case of the deranged leading the demented and dragging the despairing down with them. Soon they’ll be bickering amongst themselves, relations will start to break down and an armed conlict, fought with washing machines and fast loading broomsticks, will breakout and nobody outside “the garden” will notice Europe bleeding to death because fonda Lyin’, with the enthusiastic support of Europe’s national political élites, has turned it into a clapped out confederacy with little political and economic substance whose only value to the real world of prosperity, innovation and high per capita incomes will lie in its use as a source of low skilled bonded labour, hookers and a few slabs of stone for the tourists to gawk at in their desire to experience history flowing backwards as Europeans are forced to pay off all the debts owed to the rest of the world. re: German crisis BERLINER ZEITUNG: Letter of urgency by German family companies to Merz “The situation is dramatic”: Family entrepreneurs write open letter to Merz and SPD The CDU and SPD government plans have met with considerable criticism.

Title: Companies used to tout their climate plans. Under Trump, they’ve gone quiet.

Time Published: 2025-04-02T08:45:00Z
Full Content:
Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Just a few years ago, pledges to tackle climate change were a staple of corporate PR. Amazon trumpeted its climate pledge and stamped it on the name of Seattle’s biggest arena. Walmart promised to slash a gigaton of carbon emissions from its supply chain, and the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, with its $11 trillion in investments, pressured companies to come up with a plan to zero out their emissions by 2050. Now, many corporations are avoiding the subject altogether. During earnings calls, mentions of many well-known terms related to the climate are down 76 percent compared to three years ago, according to a recent analysis of S&P 500 companies by Bloomberg. The sharpest declines came from financial firms and consumer discretionary companies, the category for those offering optional purchases, like Starbucks and Airbnb. The hesitancy to talk about climate change — sometimes called “greenhushing” — could decrease pressure on the big corporate polluters that have been slow to cut their emissions. The trend has been linked to a growing backlash against sustainable investing, as well as a shifting political landscape with President Donald Trump’s second term underway. “I think large companies in particular today are very, very cautious,” said Hortense Bioy, the head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Companies have been caught in a tug-of-war: On one hand, investors are pressuring them to be serious about the risks of climate change to their business. On the other, the mention of any word related to so-called ESG — the polarizing acronym that refers to “environmental, social, and governance” investing — threatens blowback from the Trump administration. The way to thread the needle, experts suggest, is to stay away from flashpoints like ESG and talk specifically about the financial risks that the warming planet poses to companies. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How John Marshall, the CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan marketing firm focused on climate action, says that silence isn’t a winning strategy. “We do not think that voters or consumers are at all impressed, regardless of their political stripes, by taking the concept of climate change out of any language,” Marshall said. His research shows that investors and the public want companies to talk about climate change — as an investment risk, not a matter of morality. According to a Potential Energy report from last September, 3 in 4 Americans surveyed think companies have a responsibility to limit their impact on the climate. What’s more, roughly 9 in 10 U.S. retail investors want companies to reduce emissions and prepare for the ways increasingly unpredictable weather could lead to risks like supply chain disruptions and rising insurance costs. The first signs of greenhushing appeared in 2023, when the Swiss consultancy South Pole found that a quarter of large companies around the world had decided not to publicize their progress on climate targets. The reason, South Pole later found, was that companies wanted to avoid the legal risks that came with high-profile pledges. It was a response to countries crafting new laws against “greenwashing,” the term for deceptive environmental advertising. At the same time, financial institutions were already dealing with the backlash against ESG, which heated up in 2022. Lawsuits targeted asset managers, pension funds, and federal agencies, claiming that “woke capitalism” was putting politics over financial interests. Red states including Florida and Texas pulled billions in state funds out of BlackRock and other ESG-friendly firms. BlackRock, which in 2021 had supported almost half of shareholder proposals to address environmental and social issues, pulled a U-turn. Between July 2023 and June 2024, it only backed 4 percent of them. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How “They were too visible and too vocal about what they were doing in that space,” Bioy said. She expects that companies with big climate plans may now have to disclose the opposition to ESG as a risk in their annual reports. That sense of caution is showing up in the markets, too: Over the last two years, there has been more money leaving sustainable funds in the U.S. than what’s coming in, according to Morningstar’s research. Bioy suspects that trend still has room to run, given Trump’s hostility to climate action. In December, corporations including Apple, Walmart, and Siemens failed to sign an open letter reaffirming their commitment to the Paris Agreement, a letter organized by the climate coalition they joined after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. Bioy pointed to the guidance circulating in government organizations warning against using terms like “pollution,” “clean energy,” and “climate science.” “Companies that do business with the administration or any state organization, they will be careful not to use those terms,” Bioy said. In the past, some companies have used language around climate change that embraced a moral framing, such as “do the right thing.” But most people don’t think that’s the province of what businesses should be doing, Marshall said. Two-thirds of Americans believe that businesses should avoid taking a stance on political issues, according to his firm’s research. The moral framing provokes backlash because it feels like “forcing an idea on somebody,” Marshall said. “We have seen it’s much more effective to have language in the business community that’s about money and reality.” It raises the broader question of how regular people should talk about climate change when many of the terms environmental advocates use can provoke a knee-jerk reaction. “I think that the climate movement needs to be very thoughtful about and strategic about whether or not it is a DEI or ESG initiative,” said Austin Whitman, CEO of The Change Climate Project, a nonprofit offering tools to help businesses cut their emissions. “I think for all of us across the spectrum, regardless of what cause we’re fighting for, we need to distance ourselves from these lightning-rod acronyms and topics that are really easy to just cut down with a single swipe.” This story has been updated to clarify Apple and other corporations’ involvement in the climate coalition they joined.

Title: BlackRock approved to offer crypto services in UK, expanding digital asset footprint

BlackRock's FCA approval restricts operations to ETP support, significantly narrowing its crypto asset activities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has secured approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate as a registered crypto asset firm in the United Kingdom. The approval places BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, among a growing list of regulated companies in the region, including Coinbase and Kraken. This milestone also marks a significant step in the asset manager’s continued expansion into the digital asset space over the past year. According to the FCA’s website, the registration allows BlackRock to support its only client, iShares Digital Assets AG, in managing crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs). These products offer exposure to specific cryptocurrencies and are backed by the underlying assets. However, BlackRock’s role is highly restricted and tailored to a narrow scope of services. The firm is permitted to conduct the following activities: Facilitate the execution of crypto asset transactions to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions between the issuer and designated authorized participants. Sell digital assets for fiat currency to cover operational expenses for itself and the issuer’s service providers. Convert digital assets into fiat during early redemptions of the ETP. Meanwhile, BlackRock is not allowed to onboard new clients for this service unless it receives written permission from the FCA. Furthermore, the firm is restricted from operating automated machines that convert fiat to crypto or vice versa. It is also prohibited from holding or controlling client funds. Market observers have suggested that the approval could allow the firm to expand its iShares Bitcoin ETP to the UK. Last month, BlackRock launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP for European users via the Euronext exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, and Germany’s Xetra exchanges. This product is available to institutional and knowledgeable retail investors. It aims to provide secure and regulated access to Bitcoin through traditional stock exchanges. The ETP has a temporary fee waiver that reduces its total expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. It is denominated in US dollars and backed by Bitcoin, which Coinbase holds in offline cold storage. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Whale alert: Over $1B in USDT minted as Bitcoin investors gear up to buy the dip

Bitcoin broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and is poised to hit the $88,500 level. Bitcoin [BTC], the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, appears bullish and is poised for massive upside momentum. This bullish outlook is further supported by the recent minting of 1 billion USDT by Tether, as reported by Arkham on X (formerly Twitter), indicating increased demand from institutions or exchanges. Historically, the minting of USDT is often seen as a bullish sign for the crypto industry, especially for large assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result of this mint, the overall cryptocurrency market is already witnessing an uptrend, rising by 1.80% over the past 24 hours, with BTC also breaking out from a bullish pattern. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, BTC has turned bullish on the smaller time frame. Recently, with ongoing upside momentum, it broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the hourly time frame. Based on the recent price momentum, if BTC closes its hourly candle above the $84,000 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50% to reach the upcoming resistance at $88,500 in the near future. Source: TraduingView At press time, BTC’s price was facing resistance from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame and appeared to be breaching it as well. If this occurs, BTC could see an imminent rally. In addition to this bullish price action, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain recently shared a post on X stating that Tether bought 8,888 BTC worth $735 million in Q1 2025. This occurred during a period when BTC experienced a price drop of over 18%, indicating that the current level could be an ideal buying opportunity. Tether is not the only major player that bought BTC during the recent price crash. Major firms like Strategy (MSTR), BlackRock, and others have also seized this opportunity and accumulated BTC. This massive purchase by these industry giants gives hope that the current level might be an ideal buying opportunity. At press time, BTC was trading near $84,100, having experienced a price surge of over 2.60% in the past 24 hours. Following the minting of 1 billion USDT and the recent breakout of a bullish pattern, traders and investors have shown strong interest in the asset, leading to a 45% jump in BTC’s trading volume during the same period. This surge in trading volume is explained by traders’ $1 billion worth of bullish bets. Today, the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that traders are over-leveraged at the $81,800 level on the lower side and $84,355 on the upper level, which is on the verge of liquidation. Source: Coinglass Data revealed that traders have built $989 million worth of long positions and $287 million worth of short positions at these over-leveraged levels in the past 24 hours. So, bulls are back, and that BTC could see an impressive upside move. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Chinese antitrust regulators on Friday blocked a deal by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison conglomerate to sell two ports along the Panama Canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock. The $22.8 billion transaction between CK Hutchison, which is controlled by 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, and BlackRock involved 43 port facilities around the world. It was scheduled to conclude by April 2. The most strategically important, and politically explosive, acquisitions of the sale were ports located at either end of the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has portrayed Chinese-owned ports on the Panama Canal as threats to American national security because the Chinese military could potentially use them to shut down the canal. He hailed the BlackRock deal as a major step toward alleviating that threat when it was announced in last month. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” Trump said on March 5. International markets seemed to like the arrangement as well, sending CK Hutchison stocks into the stratosphere. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not echoed this enthusiasm, according to new reporting by Al Jazeera and Watcher Guru, a finance and cryptocurrency website. Per the reports, Dictator Xi Jinping has allegedly been displeased that Li did not consult with him about the deal or clear it with Party officials. According to Al Jazeera: The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper [the Chinese state-run Ta Kung Pao] said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. Watcher Guru also cited a recent Ta Kung Pao op-ed as describing the transaction as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” Influential Chinese state media blasted CK Hutchison in mid-March for “spineless groveling,” while Beijing’s puppet administrator in Hong Kong, John Lee, ominously muttered that the deal deserved “serious attention” from regulators – even though there was no obvious legal pretext for the Chinese government to get involved. The necessary pretext was evidently discovered at the eleventh hour, as China’s State Administration for Market Regulation suddenly announced it would investigate the deal to “protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest.” Within hours of that announcement on Friday, CK Hutchison said “there will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week.” The sale is not technically dead, but there is presently no indication of how long the Chinese government intends to continue its vague antitrust investigation. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told the New York Post on Monday. The Post editorial board said Beijing’s effort to scuttle the BlackRock deal proves Trump was “dead right” about the menace China poses to U.S. interests in the Panama Canal. “China’s rulers look determined to retain control of the strategically critical maritime conduit – whether to threaten U.S. access to the key shipping lane or to ensure it will remain open to Chinese vessels no matter what,” the editors wrote. “Beijing might stand down when it realizes its heavy hand in Hong Kong’s commercial market will frighten more firms out of doing business there – yet another step toward killing the golden goose of what had been a global financial center,” they suggested. Beijing has indeed been fretting about the flight of foreign capital from Chinese markets, in part because the overbearing Communist regime has launched a string of crackdowns against both Chinese and foreign business operations. Also, despite carefully worded promises that Xi’s deranged citywide coronavirus lockdowns will never be repeated, the shadow of the immense damage from the pandemic looms large over foreign business decisions. BlackRock itself has about $16 billion invested in Chinese stocks, which might give the gigantic investment company enough leverage to get the CK Hutchison deal rolling again after a brief regulatory delay. Or Xi could use those investments as leverage against the company, threatening its portfolio to ensure BlackRock accepts the quiet demise of its Panama Canal ambitions. Al Jazeera on Tuesday suggested an internal Chinese political and cultural angle that might be almost as significant as the international ramifications of the Panama Canal deal. It suggested that there is bad blood between aging Chinese dictator Xi and the even more aged CK Hutchison tycoon Li Ka-shing. Li is something of a legend among Hong Kong investors, and Xi is severely allergic to businessmen who have a stronger grip on the public imagination than he does. Per Al Jazeera: Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. … In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. Legal and business analysts quoted by Al Jazeera tended to side with the White House official who spoke to the New York Post, predicting that it will be legally difficult for Beijing to kill the deal if Panama exercises its jurisdiction over the canal and gives its blessing. For that matter, the legal authority of Beijing’s top market regulator to quash transactions made by a Hong Kong company is dubious. The antitrust investigation announced on Friday could be an attempt to intimidate Li, his family, and CK Hutchison executives into backing out of the sale. And it could perhaps send a signal to other Chinese businessmen as the trade war heats up that no matter whose names are printed on their company letterhead, Xi Jinping is the chief executive officer of every business in China.

Title: Commentary: Even Hong Kong’s Li family can’t escape the politics of China-US rivalry

Commentary For two weeks, Hong Kong’s richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, held firm against Beijing over the planned sale of its Panama ports assets to BlackRock. That, in itself, is truly extraordinary, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: The arm wrestling between Beijing and Hong Kong's richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, over the controversial sale of Panama Canal ports to BlackRock, an American investment giant, has surprisingly persisted longer than anticipated. After two weeks of apparent silent defiance, the Li family seemed to relent on Friday (Mar 28) when local media, citing sources close to CK Hutchison, reported that the conglomerate founded by Mr Li would not proceed with the expected signing of a deal on Apr 2 to sell its two strategic ports at the Panama Canal. This development marks the latest flashpoint in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. On the same day, news emerged that Beijing would launch an antitrust probe into the sale, part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports across 23 countries to a consortium led by BlackRock. While Beijing may appear to have succeeded in delaying the sale, this does not necessarily mean the deal is dead. The saga is expected to continue in the coming weeks or even months, potentially involving top leadership in both Beijing and Washington. CK Hutchison announced the deal on Mar 4. Less than 10 days later, Beijing-controlled newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, which is based in Hong Kong, published two sharply worded commentaries, urging the Li family to “stop being naïve and confused”. They criticised CK Hutchison of being unpatriotic and "selling out all Chinese people." This marks the first time Beijing has publicly singled out Hong Kong's most prominent conglomerate for sharp criticism in the 27 years since the city's return to Chinese sovereignty, causing jitters and concerns about the politicisation of business in the local and broader business community. Beijing's apparent loss of composure stems from not being informed of the deal in advance, amid US media reports that BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink called US President Donald Trump to secure his blessing. Mr Trump hailed the deal as part of his administration's efforts to reclaim the Panama Canal. Despite finding themselves in a political storm, the Li family has surprisingly kept its cool. In fact, the Mar 4 announcement, which stated that the sale was purely commercial in nature and unrelated to geopolitics concerning the Panama ports, remains CK Hutchison's only public statement to date. Incensed by the silent treatment, Ta Kung Pao and another pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po have published at least 20 news stories and commentaries urging the Li family to respond to "public concerns" and halt the deal in the name of national interests and security. The wrangling reached a climax on Mar 26 when Bloomberg cited sources reporting that CK Hutchison was believed to be moving forward with the deal as scheduled, despite Beijing's anger over the transaction. In response, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office again signalled its displeasure by reposting two articles published by Ta Kung Pao on Mar 26 and 27, criticising CK Hutchison for capitulating to US pressure and sacrificing national interests. The following day, CK Hutchison finally relented amid reports that the State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing would investigate the deal "to ensure fair competition" and "safeguard the public interest." Until then, Beijing had hoped that intense media pressure would suffice to persuade the Li family to pause the deal, mindful of the potential impact on business confidence in Hong Kong and China if it intervened directly. Ta Kung Pao's use of politically charged language in its commentaries has caused dismay among Hong Kong businessmen, with accusations of "aiding and abetting evil" reminiscent of wording frequently used in China's past political campaigns. In the past, such pressure tactics would have quickly forced any Hong Kong company to capitulate. The Li family's ability to withstand the pressure for two weeks is truly extraordinary. In another extraordinary development, Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, seems to be distancing himself from CK Hutchison, which is controlled by his elder brother Victor Li. The younger Li attended a high-profile forum in Beijing with senior Chinese officials and global executives on Mar 23 and 24, in his capacity as founder of Pacific Century Group. On Mar 28, China's leading business media outlets, including Caixin, published stories stating that Pacific Century Group’s businesses operate independently. The articles particularly noted that Richard Li resigned from all positions at CK Hutchison in 2000. What happens next? The delay could mean that the main parties involved in the deal, including CK Hutchison and BlackRock, will have to renegotiate the terms to accommodate both Beijing's and Washington's concerns. More likely, it will be a topic of discussion in an anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump, expected to take place in the coming months.

Title: Will TikTok Be Banned Again? As Deadline Nears, Trump Says ‘I’d Like to See TikTok Remain Alive’

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Here we go again! TikTok faces a potential shutdown in the U.S. after Saturday, April 5, if its Chinese parent company doesn’t reach an agreement to sell a controlling interest in the hugely popular video app. Will TikTok go dark? With just days to go before the deadline set by President Trump, it’s not clear what will happen next for TikTok, which claims to have 170 million users in the U.S. Some background: A federal bill passed last year with bipartisan congressional support and signed into law by President Biden mandated that ByteDance sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or essentially face a nationwide ban of the app. TikTok, after losing an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, shut down the app in the U.S. on Jan. 18 ahead of the law’s deadline. But TikTok restored service to U.S. users about 14 hours later, citing President Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to broker a solution keeping the app legal. Related Stories VIP+ New Ubisoft Subsidiary for ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Underscores Need for IP Preservation in Transmedia Era ‘Bosch: Legacy’ Casts Jeremy Glazer and Miles Gaston Villanueva in Final Season (EXCLUSIVE) Trump, who in his first term sought to force a sale of TikTok over national security concerns, now wants to keep it legal. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” he said in December, citing his belief that the app helped drive younger Americans to vote for him. Popular on Variety On Sunday, Trump told told reporters on Air Force One, “I’d like to see TikTok remain alive.” Regarding discussions about a sale of a stake in TikTok, he said, “We have a lot of potential buyers. There’s tremendous interest in TikTok,” adding, “The decision is gonna be my decision.” Who could end up owning a piece of TikTok? Oracle, which has an agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data, reportedly has been in discussions about a deal. Private-equity firm Blackstone has been mulling taking a “small stake” in the app, the New York Times reported, while others — including YouTube superstar MrBeast — have been in the mix among possible buyers. But there are wrinkles in clinching a deal. The TikTok divest-or-ban law expressly prohibits TikTok’s operation in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance; meanwhile, the Chinese government has expressed opposition to any TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. “We see no way that the TikTok algorithm is sold as Beijing and ByteDance would view this as a non-starter in a deal,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note Tuesday. Last week, Trump suggested he would use U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports as a bargaining chip in trying to win approval for a TikTok deal. “Maybe I’ll give [China] a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he told reporters. One percentage point in tariffs with China “would probably be worth more than all of TikTok, as valuable as TikTok is,” the president added. Some observers believe if April 5 comes and goes without a TikTok deal nailed down, Trump would simply declare another extension. On Jan. 20, Trump issued an executive order deferring enforcement of the divest-or-ban law by 75 days — a move that the law’s supporters said had no legal basis. As directed by Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent both Apple and Google letters that they wouldn’t be liable for hosting TikTok during the 75-day period, prompting both tech companies to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores. VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban — and It’s Not RedNote If there’s no deal by April 5, Trump would likely issue another order delaying the TikTok ban by “30 days or longer” to “fully iron out the complex deal structure,” according to Ives. The analyst said a point of deal negotiation would be ByteDance retaining minority ownership in TikTok “but potentially higher than the 20% threshold currently required by U.S. law.” Ives expects ByteDance will continue to control TikTok’s content algorithm. “We believe TikTok’s valuation is roughly $100 billion, but without the golden jewel algorithm the deal price/valuation is closer to $30 billion to $40 billion in our view,” he wrote. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees (including U.S. employees). According to the U.S.’s divest-or-ban law that targets TikTok, ByteDance is prohibited from directly or indirectly owning more than 20% of TikTok. Amid the uncertainty about TikTok’s future in the U.S., the company has seen some senior execs exit. Those include Ole Obermann, global head of music business development, and Blake Chandlee, who oversaw ad sales and marketing as head of global business solutions. Meanwhile, TikTok last week hired Nathaniel Brown, formerly Warner Bros. Discovery’s head of corporate communications, as global corporate communications chief. It’s worth noting that ByteDance did, at one point, consider selling a large position in TikTok to U.S.-based companies. Back in 2020, after Trump ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok to U.S. entities, ByteDance reached a tentative deal with Oracle and Walmart, which under the proposed terms would have acquired a combined 20% stake in TikTok. But that was scrapped after Biden assumed office in 2021 and the new administration repealed Trump’s executive order pending further review.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is Challenging a 73-Year-Old Investing Principle

For over 70 years, professional investors have relied on an investment strategy known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Developed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and Bill Sharpe, MPT popularized the classic 60/40 portfolio—roughly 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds—as a way to diversify risk and maximize returns. But Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, is now questioning that long-standing principle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the global financial system evolves, Fink argues, a better formula to allocate assets should be something like a 50/30/20 portfolio: 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 20 percent private assets, such as infrastructure, real estate and equity in privately owned companies. Fink proposed this idea in his annual letter to investors published this week, dedicating a substantial section to private markets and calling for broader access to private assets for retail investors. Private assets encompass infrastructure projects like ports, bridges, and power grids, as well as companies that aren’t publicly traded. Historically, these investments have been the domain of governments, bank loans, and wealthy individuals who have to meet strict income or capital thresholds. While they carry higher risks, these investments also tend to offer greater returns. As more companies (especially rapidly-growing ones in Silicon Valley) stay private for longer and the demand for infrastructure surges, governments and banks are struggling to keep up. “Assets that will define the future…aren’t available to most investors,” Fink wrote. “As we enter our century’s second quarter, there’s a growing mismatch between the demand for investment and the capital available from traditional sources.” To help close this funding gap, BlackRock is channeling its clients into private market opportunities through a series of strategic acquisitions. BlackRock’s clients include institutional investors—like pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies—as well as retail investors who can own a piece of BlackRock’s portfolio through its mutual funds and iShare ETFs. In October 2024, BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a firm owning and operating assets in energy, transportation, water and waste management, and digital infrastructure sectors. BlackRock is also in the process of acquiring Preqin, a leading data provider specializing in private markets, and HPS Investment Partners, an asset manager of private credit. Beyond access, another obstacle that discourages investors from entering private markets is a lack of transparency. “Investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible,” Fink wrote. “For decades, private markets have been among the most opaque corners of finance. Investors know these assets hold long-term value—but exactly how much value? That’s not always easy to determine,” he added. The answer to that questions lies in data—think how Zillow brings clarity on real estate and what Bloomberg terminals do for stocks and bonds. BlackRock aims to provide the same level of transparency to private markets through data providers like Preqin, which tracks 190,000 funds and 60,000 private asset managers globally. “Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing,” Fink wrote. “With clearer, more timely data, it becomes possible to index private markets just like we do now with the S&P 500,” the CEO added. “Once that happens, private markets will be accessible, simple markets. Easy to buy. Easy to track. And that means capital will flow more freely throughout the economy.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock Plans for Texas ETF Amid Its Push Into Lone Star State

BlackRock Inc. is going even bigger in Texas. The world’s biggest asset manager applied for the iShares Texas Equity exchange-traded fund, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The planned ETF would be passively managed and invest in companies that are headquartered in Texas. It’s the latest in a charm offensive of sorts in the state for the investing giant and founder Larry Fink after the firm’s embrace of environmental, social and governance investing drew the ire of Republican lawmakers. BlackRock, alongside Citadel Securities, is also an early backer of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange, which aims to begin trading in 2026. While declining to comment on the ETF beyond the filing, a BlackRock spokesperson said there’s client demand for Texas exposure. “Our clients have expressed interest in accessing the Texas economy, which has a GDP of $2.6 trillion according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and would be the eighth largest economy in the world on a standalone basis,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email. Nasdaq announced earlier this month that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas, stating that it has about 800 clients in Texas. About 200 companies listed on Nasdaq are headquartered in the Lone Star state. The New York Stock Exchange said in February that it would launch a fully electronic exchange in Dallas and reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas. Fees and a ticker for the fund were not yet listed in the filing. While many asset managers — including BlackRock — control single-country equity funds, state-specific stock funds are far less common. The Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (ticker TXS) and the Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF (TXSS), which both launched in 2023, have amassed about $28 million and $12 million, respectively. “The rationale here is that Texas is a good environment for businesses, and a lot are moving there,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “Anybody can buy this if it starts to crush it, and if it starts to crush it, then the narrative will kick in.” Topics Texas

Hollywood content 'is becoming less and less relevant' to young consumers, a trend that creates a 'substantial secular challenge,' veteran executive says By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Fiddling while Rome burns? Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer asserted that Hollywood should be much more concerned about demographic shifts and changes in consumer behavior as the math doesn’t look good for the traditional TV and film business. Mayer spoke Monday evening at the Paley Dialogue session hosted by the Paley Center for Media at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. In the session moderated by Jenelle Riley, deputy awards and features editor for Variety, Mayer said the traditional entertainment industry needs to act with more urgency to find new ways to reach consumers. Since the dawn of the millennial generation, time spent with traditional TV shows and movies is falling by double digits every couple of decades, he asserted.

There’s been some alarm, but maybe not quite enough.” Popular on Variety Mayer, who spent more than 15 years as a senior executive at Disney and then briefly served as CEO of TikTok’s U.S. operations in 2020, cited the dramatic shifts in the content marketplace that have emerged since the end of the pandemic and the double strikes that crippled the industry in 2023. Candle Media was created in 2021 by Mayer and his former Disney colleague Tom Staggs on the theory that high-end independent production would become more valuable in a world increasingly dominated by verticially integrated studios and streamers — like the operation he helped build at Disney. Mayer acknowledged that the sharp post-strikes contraction in content commissions by global giants has created some challenges for Candle. But the other foundational idea behind the company has proven to be very prescient given all the industry gyrations and the embrace by younger consumers of social-driven video platforms. “So it’s been much harder to sell content than the streamers now than it was three years ago when we launched,” Mayer said. “So that part of our thesis was pretty incorrect. The other part of the thesis was that there would be a flywheel that would evolve. And this is something that came from my TikTok days — that if you marry social media storytelling with traditional media storytelling, film and TV, on platforms where there’s an interactivity and you can interact with your audience and gain their trust and then sell them things, then commerce would be a big thing. And that is what we call content, community and commerce. That’s a flywheel that we felt would be a really powerful one. And that is definitively true today.” Candle’s early spree of acquisitions — including Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and “Cocomelon” producer Moonbug Entertainment — were financed by coin from private equity giant Blackrock. Despite the shifting sands in the content marketplace, Mayer assured the crowd of industry insiders that Blackrock remains steadfast in its Candle investment. “We have an incredibly great private equity partner, Blackstone, which is the biggest alternative investment manager in the world by quite a big margin. They are super0supportive,” Mayer says. They’ve been with us through thick and thin. And when we find great acquisitions, they’re ready to go and support us quite well.” Mayer suggested that future acquisitions would be “on the Moonbug side,” presumably focused on digital native content with a strong social media component. Mayer and Riley spent a good deal of time talking about the importance of YouTube as a distribution platform. “YouTube has been slogging away for 20 years, and it’s the biggest out there,” Mayer said. Most important, he added, is that YouTube shells out real money to the most popular content creators. “They pay content creators now — no one else does that. You can make money on Instagram and TikTok by going directly to a marketer and cutting a deal with them for doing an influencer marketing campaign. But the player that actually directly pays in a meaningful way its creators is YouTube.” The conversational naturally wound its way around to AI and the impact of powerful new generative AI and machine learning tools on the craft and business of entertainment. Mayer said he absorbed enormous lessons after in four months at the helm of TikTok in the U.S. “TikTok really derives its value due to his AI recommendation,” he said. “It really is another form of AI which just understands your preferences and can react and get your recommendations. And that’s what Tiktok engine is. This algorithm is one big AI code that detects your most nuanced usage of the app and can tell you exactly what you love in a way that even you don’t even know.” His four-month run as CEO of TikTok USA and COO of parent company Bytedance was more turbulent than he could have imagined. It was clear after a short time that it was untenable during President Donald Trump’s first term. Four years later, however, Trump gave TikTok a stay of digital execution as he returned to the White House. He allowed the app to resume limited operations, after the Biden administration set a deadline for the app to be sold to an American-owned firm or go dark in the U.S., while stepping up efforts to find a buyer. “I was there for a short period of time because Trump was shutting us down and issued executive orders shutting down TikTok –it was very tough to be an American executive and be the head of that company. So I stepped away from that,” he said. “I don’t know for sure what’s going on there. Seems like it has a decent chance of sticking around. But the story about TikTok is almost as interesting as using TikTok itself.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Bill Amending Oklahoma’s Anti-ESG Law Dies

(Jim West/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Fred Lucas / @FredLucasWH Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for The Daily Signal. He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. A bill in the Oklahoma Legislature to amend the state’s three-year-old anti-ESG law died last week after criticism that it would water down efforts to avoid public investments in companies boycotting oil and gas companies. ESG is an acronym for environmental, social, and governance-based investing. Oklahoma’s 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee had advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, a Republican. Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore, also a Republican, sponsored a House version. But state GOP lawmakers were divided on the matter. The bill would have removed responsibility for enforcing the law—that deals with pension investments—from the state treasurer’s office to the state attorney general’s office. “Overall, the bill would have diluted anti-ESG protections. So, I was glad to see it go,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader, the Senate sponsor, previously told The Daily Signal his bill was to “make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit.” He added that the legislation was to keep the anti-ESG law applicable, not to dilute it. Hild argued that litigation still working through the courts is not grounds to make changes. “The lawsuit was without merit,” Hild said. “The district judge overreached. It should be a basic function of government to decide who it does business with. The Legislature was overwhelmingly in support of this. Using the judiciary as an excuse not to enforce this is absurd.” Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies, including BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. The failed state Senate bill would have transferred enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. It would have also changed disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. “I was one of the many thousands of Oklahomans that called senators urging them to stop the consideration of SB 714 from forcing radical pro-ESG policies on our state,” Suzanne Ashmore, a Heritage Action for America Grassroots Sentinel from Norman, Oklahoma, told The Daily Signal. “Sentinels met with our representatives and senators in Oklahoma City to urge them to protect our oil and gas jobs and our hard earned savings from woke politics. We won’t let corporate elites crush our way of life. I’m encouraged that legislators listened.” Critics said the bill’s language would allow large asset managers to pressure companies to cut fossil fuel production through threats to vote against board members. Further, critics said that the bill would create a loophole for government agencies to ignore the statute. “ESG has become a political tool used by the Left to impose its progressive ideology on the American people. It is divisive, creates inefficiency, and has no place in Oklahoma. Heritage Action is pleased the Oklahoma Senate recognized the dangers of SB 714’s pro-ESG’s provisions and stopped it in its tracks,” Catherine Gunsalus, director of state advocacy for Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal. “We look forward to continuing the work alongside an army of grassroots Americans across the country to ensure ESG does not interfere with their livelihoods.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Dublin office market continues on road to recovery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/01/dublin-office-market-continues-on-road-to-recovery/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T15:25:27Z

The Dublin office leasing market continued its recovery in the first quarter of this year with take-up totalling nearly 39,500 sq m (425,025 sq ft). This is more than double the level seen in the same period in the first three months of 2024, but continues to lag behind the long-term quarterly average of nearly 60,000 sq m (425,175 sq ft). The improvement in the latest period follows a rebound in activity in the second half of last year. The full-year take-up for 2024 was up 66 per cent year on year. There is currently nearly 140,000 sq m (1.5 million sq ft) of stock reserved in the city, with nearly 30 per cent of this (44,129 sq m /475,000 sq ft) accounted for by Workday’s agreement to locate its new European headquarters offices at College Square, the major mixed-use scheme being developed by Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in Dublin city centre. Workday’s decision to locate at College Square was first reported by The Irish Times in August of last year. The largest deal of the latest quarter meanwhile was at Three Wilton Park, where big-four accounting group EY exercised their option to take an additional 5,100 sq m (54,896 sq ft) of space following their deal last year to lease 12,400 sq m (133,472 sq ft) at the neighbouring Two Wilton Park. The deal means that there is now no more available space at the Wilton Park scheme, where Stripe will occupy Number One, EY will occupy Number Two and three floors at Number Three, with LinkedIn occupying the remaining space. Other notable deals in the quarter include the signing of a long-term lease for two floors at Four Park Place, where a private-and-confidential occupier secured 3,512 sq m (36,712 sq ft). US-headquartered financial giant Blackrock secured a deal to occupy 2,000 sq m (21,527 sq ft) of space at Glencar House in Ballsbridge in Dublin 4. Just over 40 per cent of all deal activity in the quarter involved sustainable (Grade A+) buildings. Technology occupiers were the most active tenant group during the quarter, accounting for 27 per cent of take-up, while professional-services occupiers accounted for a further 24 per cent of all activity. Colin Richardson, head of research at CBRE Ireland said: “Rather than focusing solely on the volume of leasing completed in the first three-month period, we take encouragement from the outstanding requirements in the market.” “Demand is trending positively, and the level of reserved stock is a positive leading indicator. We expect take-up to continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of global macroeconomic uncertainty has yet to be felt in the Dublin market, but subject to announcements this week, will likely impact some decision-making as the year progresses.” Ronald Quinlan is Property Editor of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/01/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-renewable-energy-pragmatism-wind-solar/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T15:13:55Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, historically a supporter of green energy initiatives, acknowledged that wind and solar alone “can’t reliably keep the lights on” without “major breakthroughs in storage” and wrote that it’s necessary to be “clear-eyed about our energy mix” in his annual chairman’s letter to investors on Monday. Fink supported the transition to green energy in the past and heads BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, which has pushed for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG). Fink said in 2023 that he would no longer use the term ESG due to its political connotation, though he’s “not ashamed” of the term and believes in “conscious capitalism.” Fink praised nuclear power and raised doubts Monday regarding the reliability of solar and wind energy alone due to storage issues in his annual chairman’s letter. “We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix,” Fink wrote in the letter. “Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can’t reliably keep the lights on.” (RELATED: ‘Gambling With The Grid’: New Data Highlights Achilles’ Heel Of One Of Biden’s Favorite Green Power Sources) Andrew Ross Sorkin speaks with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink during the New York Times DealBook Summit on November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) “In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down,” Fink said. “Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear.” In the letter, Fink points out that more nuclear power plants have been shut down than built in the U.S. over the past 55 years and lays out the benefits to nuclear energy. “Today’s nuclear isn’t the old model of massive plants with the ominous cooling towers,” he continued. “Small modular reactors (SMRs) are everything old nuclear wasn’t — cheaper to build, safer to run, and you can build them anywhere.” (RELATED: Nuclear Energy Could Be A Godsend For Biden’s Green Agenda. Here’s What’s Holding It Back) In 2020, Fink’s letter to CEOs was focused on the fight against climate change. His 2024 chairman’s letter also called for “energy pragmatism,” though it noted that countries were increasingly installing renewables “with wind and solar power,” as it was “now cheaper in many places than fossil-fuel-generated electricity.” Fink noted that pursuing these energy sources was “also a major way to address climate change.” “We follow our clients’ mandates,” Fink wrote in the 2024 letter. “BlackRock has more than $300 billion invested in traditional energy firms on behalf of our clients. Of that $300 billion, more than half – $170 billion – is in the U.S. We invest in these energy companies for one simple reason: It’s our clients’ money. If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it – the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients.” Fink’s 2025 letter did not mention climate change, though it noted that China’s push for nuclear energy demonstrates that “they see decarbonization as a way to own the future of industry.” House Republicans sent letters to BlackRock and other asset management companies in 2023 to address concerns that their ESG efforts violated federal antitrust laws. Lawmakers wrote at the time that the companies appeared to have colluded “to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management.” BlackRock exited the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative in January of this year.

Fink added that tokenization would ‘democratize’ markets and would one day become familiar to investors like ETFs are today. Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, projected that Bitcoin [BTC] could dislodge the U.S. dollar from global reserve status. Fink cautioned that the U.S. dollar has enjoyed world reserve currency for decades, but that won’t last forever. Part of his annual letter to investors read, “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Source: BlackRock The U.S. currently has about $36 trillion in debt, with interest payments alone amounting to nearly $1 trillion for 2025. Fink added, “By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit.” In 2023, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz made a similar projection, as rising fiscal debt raises fears of currency devaluation and inflation. In fact, BlackRock made another recent call, stating that a recession would boost BTC’s value. In such a scenario, investors could resort to scarce alternatives, like gold and BTC, as a store of value. Besides, Fink expected real-world tokenized assets (RWA) to gain traction and called it ‘democratization.’ “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close.” Reacting to the Link’s statement, Nate Geraci of ETF Store said that top assets managers were ‘all in.’ For his part, DeFi research analyst, Ignas, termed Fink’s outlook on tokenization as ‘super bullish for crypto.’ Source: BlackRock That said, BTC was valued at $83K ahead of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs update.

Title: China delays $23B sale of Panama Canal ports to US-backed consortium led by BlackRock

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/01/2025 6:09:34 AM PDT by george76 China has held up the $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide — including two key ports in the Panama Canal — to a group led by US investing giant BlackRock after President Trump expressed concern about Beijing’s sway over the strategic shipping lanes. On March 4, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. ... China President Xi Jinping is reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s plans to sell its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand ... The timing of the deal’s announcement, coming just before the start of the “two sessions,” China’s most significant annual political and economic gathering, only deepened the offense for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Panama Canal — used extensively by both the US and China — has reemerged as a flashpoint in global politics after President Trump renewed his pledge to assert American dominance over the waterway. Beijing’s move to influence the affairs of CK Hutchison reinforced concerns among global observers about China’s diminishing distinction between private and public sectors as well as its aggressive encroachment into Hong Kong’s affairs.

But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. ...

by Boris Groysberg and Eric Lin Our previous article on the persistent negative impact of resume gaps received a good deal of reader attention. It’s not surprising, given the events of 2024 in the white-collar talent market. From the very start of the year, companies like Amazon, BlackRock, and Citigroup announced white-collar job reduction efforts. In the fall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported one in four American workers who lost their jobs last year came from the business and professional services sector. In September alone, nearly half a million such jobs were eliminated, the highest number for such positions in two years. Tech, media, consulting, and finance jobs are drying up at alarming rates.

Title: Investors are stunned after the stock market closed its worst quarter in 3 year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/investors-have-pain-ahead-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-01T11:42:13Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Congratulations to Vice President JD Vance, who sold his home just outside Washington, DC, for $172,000 over the asking price after less than three weeks on the market. The buyer? A former Trump official. In today's big story, investors are shocked to be battling against President Donald Trump as the stock market closed its worst quarter in three years. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is setting his sights on private markets. Tech: Move over, Disney. YouTube is about to dominate media. Business: America has an affordable housing problem. Paris has the solution. But first, there may be more pain ahead for Wall Street. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Investors have come to a grim realization: Trump's not in their corner. The stock market on Monday wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022. After back-to-back years of double-digit gains, yesterday's plunge showed just how much Trump has surprised markets since returning to the White House. It seems he is no longer the market's champion. The White House has telegraphed its position stating as much, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. "Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers," the Treasury secretary said last month. Instead of equity prices, the White House is focusing on the 10-year Treasury yield to lower borrowing costs. Meanwhile, inflation and recession fears have intensified under Trump's tariff campaign. Consumer sentiment has dropped to multi-year lows and CEO confidence is spiraling as planning for the future becomes more difficult. To make matters worse, investors should prepare for another three months of pain ahead. Once-bullish investors are feeling shellshocked coming into the second quarter. "The expected fallout from Trump 2.0's Reign of Tariffs undercuts our former bullishness and dims the prospects of our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario for now," veteran analyst Ed Yardeni wrote. He lowered his S&P 500 year-end target to 6,100 from a prior forecast of 6,400. At the same time, Goldman Sachs cut its three-month target for the index to 5,300, a possible 5% drop from current levels. It's now the eve of Trump's "Liberation Day," and investors are nervously awaiting the unveiling of a range of reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. With so much uncertainty ahead, Deutsche Bank flagged three risks to watch in the coming quarter. 1. Floyd Mayweather's big commercial real estate boasts don't match reality. The retired boxing champ has bragged about a $400 million purchase of 62 Manhattan apartment buildings. But in the month since his announcement, there's been no evidence of a sale. 2. CEO Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock. After decades of dominating the liquid markets, BlackRock is betting big on private markets. Fink wrote about the transformation in his annual letter to investors, saying the firm is focused on a "$68 trillion boom" in infrastructure. 3. Newsmax might be the newest Trump trade. The conservative media company soared more than 700% in its stock market debut, valuing Newsmax at about $8 billion. That's double the valuation of Trump Media and a third of Fox Corp. 1. YouTube is about to eclipse Disney as the biggest media company in the world. The company brought in $54.2 billion in revenue in 2024, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, which is only $5.5 billion behind Disney. But people still don't seem to understand how big YouTube really is, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 2. Elon Musk is spending millions on a supercomputer, but can he run it? xAI is spending at least $400 million on building the world's largest supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to documents viewed by BI. But it's short on the power needed to operate it. 3. Tumblr is Gen Z's newest safe space. Yes, millennials, you heard that right. Gen Zers, fed up with Musk and Zuckerberg, are reviving Tumblr dot com. How long they'll stay, however, is another question. 1. Tesla told salesworkers to "stay vigilant" in a video sent before last weekend's protests. The company described a "dynamic environment" in a clip sent to sales staff. It featured smiling employees, promo footage of Optimus and Robotaxi, and a dog — but no direct mention of the recent protests. One employee called it "trivial" and "disappointing." 2. To fix America's affordable housing problem, be more French. Paris' 19th-century redesign achieved both an unrivaled urban population density and a signature look for the city. Adopting Euro-style zoning can help US cities lower housing costs and look good doing it. 3. Don't be surprised to see Gucci ads on Fox News. Conservative media outlets say they're seeing an uptick in advertising from major brands. It's a sign advertisers now see avoiding right-leaning media as a risk — and it's also a 180 from the brand boycotts of Trump's first term.

From Aurelien by e-mail: She’s speaking at the moment but it doesn’t look good. What she did was not unprecedented in the French system (basically moving money around to meet costs elsewhere) but it was done very clumsily, and left a paper trail behind. She also denied everything from the word go, in spite of the evidence, and her defence witnesses were very unconvincing. It just goes to show that the RN is actually a pretty amateurish organisation, with a very limited capability outside Le Pen herself. I don’t think anyone else is capable of running in 2027. The political consequences are effectively impossible to predict at this stage. From Politico’s EU morning newsletter: IS LE PEN MIGHTIER THAN THE COURT? “I’m combative. I won’t let myself be eliminated,” a visibly infuriated Marine Le Pen said Monday evening. In her first interview after an embezzlement conviction that leaves her unable to run for office for five years, the far-right icon conspicuously refused to endorse her lieutenant in the National Rally, Jordan Bardella. That was the first sign of where Le Pen’s head is at as she makes an agonizing choice, as my colleagues Clea Caulcutt and Marion Solletty lay out: — Let them eat cake: After painstakingly transforming her father’s racist party into an electable force, Le Pen was a strong contender to win the French presidency in 2027. So she could boost Bardella to take the top spot on the ticket. — Après Marine, le déluge? Or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the French justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. Both options come with risks. Bardella is still seen as green (profile here). And so far, the French public seem pretty comfortable with Monday’s court ruling. An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro published Monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that France had a healthy democracy. Another 65 percent said they were “satisfied” or “indifferent” to the verdict, Victor Goury-Laffont reports. LIBERAL UNEASE: Yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. Sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law — Le Pen was convicted of misusing European Parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. But it’s not a popular rejection by the demo.

We’re hoping he lives for many more years. > The siege of Khartoum has lifted. Left behind are scenes of unimaginable horror Wesley’s List: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran. On a side note, the phrase ‘Empire of Chaos’ dates to at least 1814. Not the first time that Khartoum has been under siege and has fallen- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6UfPtyjYQo (4:43 mins) I was lucky enough to visit Khartoum for a wedding fifteen or so years ago (an Establishment British friend married a high society British-Sudanese girl). It was quite an affair (2,000 people in a tent, every man with his stick, three days of celebrations and not a drop to drink…) and the city and country were a wonderful experience. We had to take cash and travellers’ cheques though because the country was cut off from SWIFT and only Diners card worked. As a result, the “Hilton” had long ago stopped paying licence fees to the brand owner but had kept the name. :-) We visited the pyramids at Meroe (now controlled by warlords); we spent afternoons in the fabulous National Museum (now looted); we saw the Sufi’s whirling in Omdurman (now a horror scene along with Khartoum). It was a well ordered, proud, dignified society that had made the best of a thin hand after it threw off colonial rule. The destruction of Sudan by Great Power meddling is a great crime. That sounds like an amazing experience. I knew a few cyclists who managed to cycle through the country back before it was ruined – they said that in all of Africa they had never experienced such hospitality, and they always felt safe. I was immediately struck by this headline. But the reason was that I could no longer imagine any horrors that were “unimaginable.” As I read on this was confirmed, the horrors sounded all too familiar. For example: “…They recount a siege of theft and murder, as a trigger-happy RSF militia shot those who resisted their demands. Afraid to carry their dead to graveyards, people buried those killed in shallow graves in their own streets and back yards. Elsewhere, corpses have been left to decompose where they fell. Widespread sexual violence against the civilian population has been reported from the early days of the war. It is an indication of the total siege that Khartoum was under that there isn’t yet a reliable estimate of the death toll.” For “RSF” substitute “IDF,” and for “Khartoum” substitute “Gaza.” As Clark’s list suggests, we could play this game all day. There’s no shortage of such scenes. Far from being “unimaginable,” we have to fight to keep from being numb to them. I’ve been in Khartoum a number of times for professional reasons, and whilst I can’t say it’s my favourite African country, I was always well looked after and the people are very hospitable. The Sudanese are an also a proud people and I remember being taken around the National Museum, and being told that the Sudanese had pyramids when the Egyptians were in short trousers. They were also proud of never being an Arab colony, but adopting Islam voluntarily because it had a well-developed system of commercial law. But the problem is a regime that has kept power by force (with a brutality comparable with we’ve seen in recent days) and cynically instrumentalised Islam as a way of controlling the population. It was always argued that the regime’s practice of subcontracting security to militias in distant areas of the country would backfire, and now it has. With regards to your quote on news about Marine LePen, i was wondering that OK, RN schemes were clumsily done and left a trail, but, what if in other cases there are similar trails to be followed but those aren’t followed because there is less interest in doing the same with “establishment” parties. The orders could be “focus please only on parties deemed as menaces” no matter what you find. Just as a possibility. Re: Honey bee collapse. I am a bee keeper myself and a pretty big one as hobby keepers go. It is the same story like with bird flu. You have completely unnatural conditions that result in bad immunity that result in enhanced disease. Nobody looks at the underlying conditions and “specialists” “veterinarians” a.s.o. look for some magic solution. Some basics: bees in nature stay in one place and then collect nektar, pollen a.s.o. from plants that offer the bees sustenance at various times of spring into the summer. All that in a natural order. First bloom the cherries, then the apples and at the end the chestnut trees. On top there are hundreds of different flowers, scrubs a.s.o. Each plant offers something slightly different to the bees. In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year. After the first half of the year you take away the larger part of honey and substitute it with sugar. That is how small beekeepers work all over the world. Big commercial bee keepers move from one mass flowering to the next. For instance canola to almonds. As you have mono cultures you can´t leave the bees in place. In an almond grove there would be no other food but the nektar from almonds and after the bloom bees would simply starve to death. And as the almonds groves are so massive in California you must get the bees from out of state. So commercial bee keepers need to truck their bees over hundreds and thousands of miles. From the above you can see that it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food. All that is apart from all the pesticides and fungicides that are in use in intensive agriculture. Just as you won´t get rid of bird flu in chicken concentration camps you will also never have healthy bees under such circumstances. There is no other option but to dial back the industrialisation of agriculture. Except it won´t happen unless there´s a catastrophy. Seems like we are heading that way. As with bird flu – in order not to be forced to look at the whole picture – they will try ever new band aids and find ever new “reasons” for the sudden problems. “… it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food.” Interestingly it’s also how we’re harming ourselves with highly processed foods. Lack of the right mix of foods to support good gut health and lack of vital micro nutrients that never make it through the processing of the food ingredients. Almonds have really been a disaster cloaked initially by being so damn profitable, which only encouraged everybody and their mother to plant ever more of the jackrabbit of food bearing trees (some varieties will get you a commercial crop after only 4 years) to the point where there are more almond trees in Cali than there are citizens in the USA, and every last one of them needs pollinators. Then the wholesale price went from $4.50 to a buck fifty a pound, and growers are going b/k all over the place, but not before playing a huge part in the destruction of our bee population in the USA. Bees there-done that “In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year.” Wasn’t there also the practice in traditional agriculture to have some late-flowering plants (e.g. ivy) around to enable bees to forage in Autumn? In the traditional agriculture in my yard, I have plants that bloom from early spring (crocus) to late fall (aster) with the intention that there will always be something around for the bees. I do plant a vegetable garden too, and I have gotten in the habit of letting at least some of my broccoli go to flower. The bees really like the yellow blossoms in the fall since they are one of the few flowers around in our area at that time. Didn’t this happen also in the early 2000s? I remember a save the bees campaign back then with predictions of a crop apocalypse. What happened, why no apocalypse that time? It was Neonicotinoids then I believe Support your local beekeepers. I have had an at least one serving per day honey habit for years. My local sources include one beekeeper who sells at the farmers market in MA and another from an activist beekeeper up north in VT. I also have a jar of Oacaxa honey (very intense) for special occasions. (A long time ago in college I worked at the usda bee culture lab in Madison. Which is where I learned to out honey in burns.) Nice to hear that you buy honey local. In fact the honey will be in sync with nature around you and with you as well. Also ask your local bee keeper to give you some propolis and some wax. Propolis helps against all kind of ailments and it is not difficult to make your own tincture and ointment once you have the above. Big pharma doesn´t like propolis ointments (acting through the FDA) but you can make your own. The farmers market here starts again in about three weeks. I will ask. Thanks. To the extent that people in cities, towns and suburbs spend some of their disposable income on “artisanal” food from relatively nearby, to just that extent will little zones of artisanal and “artisindustrial” agriculture survive right near those centers of customer spending on less-industrial food. And pay cash if you can. Many commercial beekeepers treat bees like slave labourers, starve them, destroy their social behaviours, overcrowd them and infest them with pests, and then are shocked – Shocked! – they die in droves. And expect people to pity them and compensate them for their losses. Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam!

Coming soon: Skipper “Body Shop” mix and match gender transactional clinic with attached Playground. The swings go both ways! That is funny! Diego Garcia is a gift to Iran. A military base used by the USA but technically controlled by the UK (we can ignore Mauritius’s claims) with essentially no civilian population who might be hit (there was an encampment of some unlucky migrants who washed up in a boat years ago but they were recently removed). It’s the perfect target for a demonstration of strength. Or do the UK and USA see this and encourage it? Has the USA moved all its B2 bombers there to tempt Iran into doing something it can use as an excuse for USA and Israeli escalation? They certainly didn’t move them there to bomb Iran. Those aren’t fighting bombers, they’re for trading etc…. Another western own-goal….in that the US is/will be using B-2s over Yemen as apparently the US Navy can’t park a carrier off the coast of Yemen (as the US did in 1967 off of Vietnam) without using all of its anti-air ammo. B-2s have a finite, expensive lifespan before needing lots of maintenance. Billions of dollars of capital, operating at millions of dollars per hour…all to “destroy” a military operated by a country that is not even recognized by 100% of the countries around the world. Team Trump is continuing Team Biden’s strategy of (a) “doing something” and kicking the can down the road is better than (b) sitting at a table and hashing out an agreement that might be incrementally negative for Israel. Someone should show Trump a map. Maybe leave it on his Oval Office desk. On this map, Yemen is labeled in big red letters “Mini Vietnam” Iran “Big Vietnam” Ukraine “Big Mama Vietnam” and China-Taiwan “Big Daddy Vietnam”. GOP = MAGA held by the puppet strings of “I stand with Zion”…. even Trump can’t grasp that Diego Garcia plays a prominent role in Twilight’s Last Gleaning, JM Greer’s all too plausible story of how the American empire finally comes crashing down Remember that part of the book well. The Chinese take Diego Garcia in a well planned raid but that was in response to the US bombing a Chinese mainland air base to teach them a lesson. Yeah, and events in the non-fiction world are proceeding unnervingly like they do in the book. Doesn’t take much imagination to see an aircraft carrier washed up on a beach somewhere. The story ends on a rather hopeful note – won’t give it away, but it’s not the worst possible outcome, not by a long shot I found that ending to be very hopeful as well. But to think that it all started because the US tried to smash & grab an African country so that they steal their newly discovered oil. Can’t imagine where Greer got that idea I just watched the movie “Twilight’s Last Gleaming,” 1977, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Perhaps there’s a different movie of the same name but the one I saw doesn’t seem to match up with comments like “American empire finally comes crashing down..” In the movie I saw Lancaster convinced the president played by Charles During to admit to the public the reason for the Viet Nam war. In the end Durning, Lancaster, and his cohorts are all shot down to prevent the public from knowing the truth. I found it heartening that in 1977 a producer had the balls to air such truth in public. Not that it did much good. The ending where the president is gunned down and the only one to run to his side was his Aide showed the disdain of all the rest of his advisors and cabinet members for his desire to speak the truth. I imagine this bears some element of truth about presidential politics even today. It also showed that even the president is expendable if he doesn’t go along with the “agenda.” Our current and future presidents may want to avoid pissing off government and non-government organizations who might wish him (or her) to retire early. Different story. Greer’s book was published in 2014. Well worth a read ‘Megatron @Megatron_ron BREAKING: 🇺🇲🇾🇪 Yemen’s Houthi have shot down an American MQ-9 ‘Reaper’ drone above the city of Marib’ By their own count, this is the sixteenth MQ-9 Reaper Drone that they have shot down. At about $30 million a pop, you are talking about nearly half a billion dollars worth of Reapers turned to ash. Start cranking all the other associated costs and now you are talking well north of half a billion bucks. If they can do this, then it is only a matter of time until they get a luck hit on a Navy ship in the Red Sea. So what will Trump do then? Rage that he will unleash hell or some such? Offer to make a deal? If he can’t break tiny Yemen, than what makes him think that he can do so to Iran? Stephanie Kelton to debate Steve Moore April 16th, she gonna eat his lunch and snacks! Colorado River Water disappearing. Here I thought it was over-appropriation and use by humans. It’s the damned headwaters biomes! Blame the ecosystem, NOT the humans! I saw that too. All that freeloading, parasitic vegetation sucking up all that water which could used for almonds farms or whatever. I got an idea. They should spray Agent Orange all over that region and kill off all that lazy, unproductive vegetation so that all that water will have the freedom to flow unhindered to the Colorado river. Problem solved! An idea that Trump himself could be proud of. They’ve tried that already, the Mekong River. So, the Colorado “deforestation” campaign will be the Beta test? (Do they have Marmot Cong in Colorado?) Water is for lying over/Whiskey is for lying under: dept. The difference from Cali water and Colorado River water, is the latter allows for so much potential pilfering compared to the relatively short delivery span of aqua here-less chances of chicanery. Trump should impose tariffs on those free loading plants. Because it will make him feel better without actually doing harm to anyone or thing. It’s almost all orchards here in the southern San Joaquin Valley, and farmers & local officials of the far right persuasion refer to the pines that get first dibs on water in the higher climes as: ‘Straws’ I can just imagine those orchard owners looking up to all those pines while fingering a cigarette lighter in their pocket. There are an estimated 129 million dead trees in CA that are no longer water straws. But they are ready to burn. I remember reading that there is great concern that CA will have the most massive wildfire, ever, in the Sierra Nevada. Methinks the number is closer to 200 million newlydeads in the Sierra Nevada, and the 129 million number is from the 2012-16 drought. In the earlier epoch rarely did a pine above 7,500 feet succumb to the bark beetles, now its closer to a 9,000 foot ceiling for the die-off. It’s my contention that Bill Gates stays awake at night fretting about all those birds sleeping for free in his trees. The man really hates Nature. Maybe this would help him: “Mother Earth.” You laugh… The Tamarisk Hunters Canadians were clubbing the baby seals because seals ate their fish… Stabroek Block Oil reserves estimate of 11 Billion barrels… Hess believes more. US uses 20 Million bbl/per/day m/l; 11,000,000,000 / 20,000,000 = 550 days of US demand. Heck with the rest of the world demand, it’s all about US. Note, there is an absence of we in US these days.

When you are an engineer, air is just another fluid. The Cup is never half-empty. Lots of listings for “true cross” reliquaries on auction sites. Legal update: CFPB spared, for now: https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5220651-federal-judge-trump-cfpb/ A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from effectively dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an early target of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson barred the administration from stopping work and firing employees at the CFPB and ordered the reinstatement of previously terminated workers. She also blocked the destruction of any CFPB records and ordered the recission (sic) of any “wholesale” contract cancellations issued on or after Feb. 11. However, USAID has met its fate. An Appeals court lifted a lower court’s TRO restraining and held that the Trump admin and Elon may proceed feeding it headfirst into the wood-chipper. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that social-media posts like Musk’s declaration that he “fed USAID into the wood chipper” didn’t legally prove he was making the orders. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/appeals-court-clears-way-for-doge-to-keep-operating-at-usaid/ar-AA1BRPGO Musk is feeding more than the agency into the wood chipper: The axing of some 10,000 programs has consigned untold numbers of children and refugees to death, officials say. https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-usaid-rubio-marocco-canceled-programs-gaza-syria-congo-hiv-ebola Are we 100% sure that all those programs are what they seem? USAID is a front for the CIA after all. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna While I’m not a fan of the chainsaw budget cutting, he might inadvertently be doing a lot of people a favor. Of course we can’t possibly be 100% sure. Is it 100% certain that the Guardian article is true? It’s clear, though, that the humanitarian programs exist and are crucial to the health and survival of many people around the world in poor countries, even if the CIA is involved in some cases. This is according to media reports, the UN, multiple private aid agencies, government officials, etc. Pretty sure these are actual programs that help people: S. Africa: USAID cuts could prompt over 500,000 HIV deaths https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420 and https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-trump-funding-pause-500-million-food-spoilage-risk/ “USAID plays a major role in coordinating earthquake assistance.” https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-notified-congress-intent-reorganize-usaid-rubio-says-2025-03-28/ There are many more examples. I doubt the CIA is involved in all of them. Why couldn’t the aid have been continued de-coupled from any spook activities? Axing all of them at once is unconscionable. But, Musk obviously doesn’t care about that and scored political points by doing so. It was probably the humanitarian programs in particular which upset Musk. A short critical German comment on USAID by Austrian Hannes Hofbauer (whose restrictive views on migration I e.g. do not share.) machine-translation from German NACHDENKSEITEN On the end of USAID: self-empowerment instead of external control https://archive.is/frJFL “(…) Development of underdevelopment Malaria: widespread. HIV: Africa’s hostage. Hunger: not eradicated. Since the term “development aid” was popularized in the 1960s, hopes have rested on it – in vain, as history shows. According to a UNICEF report, 733 million people worldwide were affected by hunger in 2023, 152 million more than four years previously. Africa leads the field, with a 20 percent increase in the number of hungry people. Since 2010, the number of undernourished people has also been rising sharply again – in sub-Saharan Africa from 18 percent to 23 percent.[ The entire paradigm of development aid – rich north helping poor south – has failed across the board. Honest aid workers can hardly admit this, and those who abuse it as an instrument to build political influence and economic outflow cling to it anyway, out of self-interest. (…) Through so-called partnership agreements, the EU has also opened markets to EU-European goods with over 30 African and Caribbean countries, driving local businesses, farmers, and fishermen to ruin. Their sons, deprived of their livelihoods, are drawn north, across the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to Europe. (…)” Of course within a huge structure through e.g. inertia some positive outcomes of any such opertion are not impossible. Just look at British or French colonial history. In fact to offer genuine aid bolsters any form of serious control. But the strategic relentless prerogative shouldn´t be denied. USAID reminds me a bit of philanthropy: People turn into billionaires by destroying the lives of millions ripping off entire countries. While at home using that profit they pay for cultural or social services to the benefit of a few hundred or thousand – admired by media. Like shooting off someone´s leg in order to steal his home but then getting him a wheel-chair for free under the eyes of the press. p.s. To clearify: An Elon Musk doesn´t care for the Global South any more than any EU-Commission member or Boeing. So the positive effects of USAID dismantled again are certainly not intended. I must admit to quite a bit of schadenfreude watching Musk whine about vandalism on his lots on Fox’s “The Five” this afternoon. Poor baby after taking a chainsaw to the lives of thousands. Otherwise, things are getting biblical. The SSA change that ends using phones for making changes to one’s SS account quickly became, in some news circles, a decree that all SS recipients come into the offices that are still open to prove their identity. Made it seem all Christmassy to me: “And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world…” Then to satisfy my curiosity about the UK’s breakdown, I watched this fellow get interviewed by the same hard right British “channel” as interviewed the frightening young fellow I linked several days ago. This guy, who was a Tory and UKIP member of Parliament for more than a decade, says that “being born in a stable doesn’t make you a horse.” He proposes that Britain should “remigrate” up to the second generation of descendants of immigrants back to the countries where their ancestors came from. In other words, if your grandpa came from Jamaica, even if legally, back you go. But this Mr. Carswell offers his advice not from a post in not-so-merry old England but from the American state of Mississippi where he is the CEO of some non-profit funded by somebody who shouldn’t be allowed to have money. So when I heard Carswell advocate for returning the first and second generation of British descendants of immigrants, legal or illegal, this sprung to mind: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me Crazy times. “Trump to Unveil Country-Based Tariffs April 2 in Rose Garden” Of course the whole thing is a shakedown. He is putting a tariff on every country that there is but I think that the real reason is so that he can extract economic concessions from them. I think that there are two or three demands that the Trump regime is making of Oz. One is to get rid of our PBS subsidized drugs so that Big Pharma can make big profits here like in the US but that is absolutely the third rail in Oz politics. Another is stranger. There is an attack on our Goods & Services tax here in Oz. In short, you buy something or pay for a service here, you have to pay a tax on it. The US is crying that it is an unfair tax but many States in the US do exactly that- https://theconversation.com/is-australias-gst-a-tax-or-a-tariff-and-why-has-it-become-a-target-in-the-trade-wars-250041 I think that the problem is that the US buys more from Oz than Oz buys from the US and Trump is upset by that. But there is a solution. The biggest export to the US by a country mile is gold which is why the imbalance. So I propose that we stop selling gold to the US. Immediately the deficit will run the other way, Trump is happy and I am pretty sure that Oz can find another country to sell our gold to. Anybody know the telephone area code for Beijing? AI is “running out of juice” (The Register) https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/14/ai_running_out_of_juice/ If you look closely at what Microsoft has been doing with AI, you’ll see that it’s pulling back in places some of us wouldn’t think to look. Microsoft has canceled more than a gigawatt of datacenter operations in addition to numerous 100-plus MW agreements. I’m old enough to remember when the “Juice” ran for 2003 yards, breaking Jim Brown’s NFL rushing record in the old Shea Stadium. Maybe AI must bring back “the Juice” for the man in the street? Regarding the ruckus about the USA moving airforce assets to Diego Garcia: “The media and some readers argued that Iran might not be able to reach Diego Garcia. Iran is signaling otherwise.” There is another hypothesis: those B2 & co bombers are not there to attack Iran, but to subdue Yemen. I agree with that hypothesis. I already commented here that I believe the USA first has to crush Yemen if a joint Israel-USA attack against Iran is really to take place: having Ansarallah capable of wreaking havoc in the rear is something that must be excluded for such an offensive to have any chance of success (and even then). The massive bombardments that are now taking place against Yemen (several dozens of attacks daily) show that the focus is on eliminating Ansarallah as a player able to lob missiles and drones at Israeli and American ships and bases in the region. If and when this is achieved, then the USA will be able to proceed with Iran. I see Iran has three Kilo-class submarine. Can you imagine what would happen if after the US launched an attack against Iran, that one of them surfaced near Diego Garcia and lobbed a few missiles into the airbase just as those planes were getting ready to land again? Just sink (or debilitate) US Navy oilers in random corners of the world. The US only has so many. even losing one makes things more complicated The US military has a logistical chain built on playdoh Not sure the Iranian Kilo boats have missile capability? RE: The Code That Controls Your Money I notice that it is written by someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC (paraphrasing): I can no longer see any way for a human to progress without harming another Which resonated then, and booms emptily more these days. a natural consequence of having 8+ billion people on the planet, and the politically incorrect observation that certain jurisdictions have 0, or negative, non-migration population growth while others don’t. PS, I hate the Club of Rome and their intellectual heirs I think that is a bit of a stretch, we (as a species) are bearing the consequences of earlier globalisations, destabilising previously stable populations. Do you enjoy being historically incorrect as much as politically? “someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC” I doubt it. The article states that Clive Thompson is a journalist who writes about science and technology and as far as I can remember, NakedCapitalism commentator Clive was a software engineer, not a journalist. Since the article talks about COBOL, let me add a few points. 1) Learning COBOL — or most other programming languages — is not that difficult. While this is the first obstacle to having programmers able to deal with those legacy systems, the other software components and libraries that those COBOL programs rely upon constitute a really big hurdle. I bet that many of those banking/financial/insurance COBOL programs make use of the services of such software systems as CICS and IMS — IBM technology from the 1960s to deal with transactions and databases. Yes, IBM is still maintaining all of it. This is something that is often forgotten: learning a programming language is not enough; one must be knowledgeable with a large set of external libraries, additional software components, and ancillary services to develop or maintain anything of value. This does not just affect COBOL; the situation is the same with modern programming languages (for instance, since they are mentioned in the article, Java, Python, JavaScript). 2) By the mid-1980s, development had moved from programming individual COBOL statements that invoke those auxiliary libraries and modules explicitly, to embedding some higher-level descriptions or instructions in the COBOL program that would then be processed and automatically transformed into the necessary COBOL code. For instance, one would insert a (properly tagged) SQL statement that would then be replaced by the necessary COBOL calls to the database management system. This was possible not just for database functions, but also for user interfaces, report writers, communications, etc. So when reading about the sheer amount of existing COBOL code, remember that a large fraction of it is not hand-coded, but automatically generated from other formalisms (at least from the late 1980s onwards). 3) Ah, the infamous “GOTO”! Two things: first, it is “GO TO” in COBOL, not “GOTO”. Second, the real killer in COBOL is the “ALTER” statement. I will not explain it, but suffices to say that our teacher of COBOL refused to explain its semantics, telling us to never use it, and that one of my colleagues once joked about making use of one such statement to make life “interesting” for future maintainers of the application he was developing. Disclaimer: I learned COBOL at the University, and developed in COBOL in the mid-1980s. What I remember is the hierarchy between application programmers and systems programmers. The systems guys were the high priests needed to make things work — they knew the inner workings of the OS. In my DoD days we had Ada as the language that would incorporate all the best software engineering ideas. Problem was it was competing with the private sector C and then C++/C# with OOA/OOP concepts and while DoD was important, thanks to the mini/micro revolution it wasn’t big enough to command things. Agree that much of the problem is a system engineering one. Interfacing systems, understanding and implementing APIs, testing interoperability. I guess Rust is coming on as the language de jour, with JSON and REST getting a lot of the web interfacing chores. Much respect, thanks for this comment. I was employed for about 5 years writing Javascript in my mid-30s back when the WWW was fairly new, after failing Comp Sci 101 in the 80s with punchcards. But I’ve always been fascinated by the history of computing. “Germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war” This could get interesting. I can just see the next general NATO meeting now and where the German representative stands up and says- ‘OK now. Just for the official record. So you want Germany to build up our military into a powerful force once more.’ Lots of nods. ‘Then you want German tank armies to go charging across the plains of Poland.’ More nods from the other NATO members. ‘Then you want the German army fighting the Russians in front of the gates of Moscow.’ Yet more nods. ‘And nobody sees a problem with any of this.’ The other NATO members then shake their heads. Lighten up,Kev. This is very much the age of looking forward,not back. Are you going to hold Baerbock and Baroness VDL to account for their descendants’ honourable sins forever? Then Mark Rutte says “I assume I’ll be getting a raise?” to many nods and whispers Wait,…did I just hear a champagne cork…? Annalena Baerbock (AB): Radek, why our all those new tanks you bought recently parked at our border? Radek Sikorski (RS): We wanted to protect them from the Russians. Hold them in reserve. AB: Ok, that makes sense but why are they all still pointing towards Germany? RS: It costs lots of fuel to even turn those big boys around so we just left them like that for now. But don’t worry, we can have them do a full 360 in a flash. AB: Thanks for the reassurance. Do you think you could lend us a few attack helicopters. I read you bought a bunch of those recently too. RS: Sorry, no. AB: Are you still planning to do a joint build with South Korea of fighter jets in Poland? RS: Sorry, can’t discuss that. Do you need some old MIG’s? AB: No, I hate anything Russian. RS: Well, at least we have that in common. Good luck. But isn’t there also a history of Germany forcing overthrow of the Russian government followed by civil war? Only when the Romanovs were still in charge, right? Never even close since then. Rev Kev that is pure comedy! RE:The Senescence Loop What do you expect from a lamarckian process?

Heaven knows my predictive powers are at best crummy; I have predicted 10 out of the last 2 bear markets. This is the point in time where, in the past, Ben Bernanke or Greenspan would have dropped a surprise 50bps rate drop on the market, effectively nuking “Da Bears” from low Earth orbit. But this ain’t 2007 or 1998, so perhaps we are going to see this stinking market crater into oblivion. When CNBC puts up the “Markets in Crisis” banner that’s time to buy. In the hundred daze campaign by our Tettotalitarian Leader, he’s done everything to alienate anybody left that still has a scintilla of sense, and they’re all tied to us via the almighty buck, yuck.

Adios hegemony~ Don’t even want to bring up Hiroshima & Nagasaki, but we’re zeroing in on the fourth turning there, too. I have a bad feeling about this, to quote Indiana Jones. There will be some rip-your-face-off countertrend rallies in the coming bear market, to be sure. But it’s clear to me that AI has come a cropper, and deglobalization won’t come easily. Predatory late-stage capitalism doesn’t have a reverse gear … that means driving us all off a cliff is the endgame. Can you imagine various European nations recommending their citizenry to have 72 hours worth of rations on hand, in late August of 1939? That’s the feel of goings on, prepping for 3 days-not 2,200 days. I just assumed that was a form of narrative building, i.e. “evil Russkies, mama!” meant to scare the locals into a docile and subservient position. My operating assumption is that WWIII has already begun. But to your point, the notion that it will all be over in 72 hours, and then we can to back to our regularly scheduled episodes of “Real Housewives of the ATL” is rather comical. More likely, it will play out like “The Walking Dead.” BTW, error noted – Han Solo said “I have a bad feeling about this” not Indiana Jones. Quite true that- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogIuFclGE8 (1:52 mins) Yes. “It’s a trap!” The German title for Don Siegel´s “Madigan” was – “Nur noch 72 Stunden” / “72 hours left” The German title for Paul Haggis´s remake “The Next Three Days” was – “72 Stunden – The next three days” The German title for Javier Gutiérrez´s “Tres Dias” was – “72 Stunden – nur noch 3 Tage” Germans seem to have a math problem. So if you bring in 2,200 days that´s not gonna end well. Total confusion. By total I mean – a “One thousand” – kind of confusion. (“360-degrees-syndrom” also made in Germany) p.s. as Ian Proud is concerned – that was an April 1st prank by him on us In the UK, many families don’t have the next meal on hand and our government just doesn’t care. Now that more working class and middle class families find their earners trapped in the gig economy, they are beginning to rely on food banks rather than making donations to them. And when the middle class feel the bite of hunger and the threat of permanent impoverishment for their offspring, that’s when the need for real political reform takes shape in their minds and they take the first faltering steps towards reality. I think we are reaching the position where Farage will make a real breakthrough and Reform becomes a broad enough church to win the next election. It might be a good idea to have a government relying on a parliamentary majority consisting of people with little or no political experience who have become politicians out of necessity because they’ve given up hope in the existing order and not because it is a good career choice for someone on the make. But as with other countries in Europe, will the British establishment allow new politicians into power or find creative ways to block them? “Taiwan accuses Chinese chipmakers of illegally poaching engineers” Maybe that story is not so simple. Maybe those Taiwanese bosses told some of their engineers that they have a new assignment for them. That they will be sent to the US to go work in setting up a new chipmaking foundry there. And those engineers sat down after work in a bar sharing their thoughts. Working and living in America would be a great experience. Doing the same in Trump America may be not so much. Even Canadians are avoiding traveling there and the number of ways that you can fall afoul of law enforcement/ICE/FBI, etc. is legion. On the other hand they can actually see China from their office windows. You could work there and see family every weekend. They talk the same language and have the same customs. For any Taiwanese engineer that would be a great temptation and it is not like Taiwan values its workers that much. The headline just seems to conjure images of Chinese poachers, dressed in Ghillie suits, stalking the streets of Taipei and darting unsuspecting engineers with trank guns, then dragging their unconscious forms off to Shanghai. I suppose that even works as a resurrection of the old verb “shanghai,” right?

Someone wake me up after this nightmare is over. Odds are more likely we too will wake up in an El Salvadorian prison than in our own beds before the nightmare is over. I’ve no idea what a useful path forward may be but does not seem like an ideal time to go to sleep. Crazy that we’re losing a debate on the merits of the Magna Carta in 2025. Seems like only yesterday this anti-Due Process crowd was livid over cancel culture. “Trump Administration Targets Harvard With Review of $9 Billion in Federal Funding ” My take is that Big Ed, much like DEI-wokeworld made a lot of enemies and alienated almost all potential allies. Now the Republicans in power are going to smack them around a bit. It’s a cheap giveaway to some of their allies with the bonus of dinging what has become a power base for the Democrats. Perhaps they can keep Harvard going with plasma donations in the i.v. league, er mobile blood donation vans? Unfortunately, I think this is a significant factor. And it’s nothing new. George Wallace used to slap “pointy-headed liberals” around a lot with much success, and conservatives have been making fun of obscure research projects by academics forever. And liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped. Many people who do not live their lives in academic bubbles or education-adjacent PMC enclaves do not see the world the same way and will not connect the necessary dots. I was very sympathetic toward that Rutgers Resolution for the Big Ten schools, but I doubt if that would be the case for the broader public. Now if Trump were to slap a 25 percent tariff on football tickets or alumni donations to athletic programs, well that would be a whole new ball game – so to speak. (See, I can’t even keep myself from being condescending!) Not a fan of “liberal condescension toward the deplorables” but having been born in the Heartland and moved to the coastal cities as an adult I find the crying about condescension to be hypocritical at best. Mostly it seems like projection. Much like the GOP cries of “groomers” when every week another is busted for worse. Anecdotal but the only times I’ve ever had a gun pointed at me were by the NYPD (lived in a latino neighborhood and police raids were common) and in the heartland by a guy who didn’t like my “fruity” look. Also while in Texas on a film production had a local in a cowboy hat and AR-15 graphic t-shirt threaten to “kick my Hollywood p-ssy -ss” for enforcing on-set mask mandates back in 2020. I could list numerous other examples of Heartland values I’ve experienced that 25+ years of NYC/LA living have avoided but won’t for brevity. I’ll just say that I’ve lived in city neighborhoods often deemed dangerous yet have never had threats or issues in these places like I have experienced in small town America. So, for some of us, not seeing “the world the same way” is why we prefer the very flawed world view of coastal elites. Yeah, I got turned down for a job because they didn’t want to hire a cis white guy (was surprised they actually said that!) but they’ve never pulled a gun or threatened to beat me. Every so often I scroll through the threads on Truth Social, Rumble, and Gettr to get a glimpse of the conservative cultural landscape. Similarly will browse Bluesky and Mastadon for liberal ones. The liberal platforms are very PMC Russia-gate delusions of being one lawsuit and Sorkin speech away from mimosa brunch utopia. The conservative ones are a descent into violent civil war fantasies, gun fetishists, replacement theory rantings, and dreams of putting women back in their place. Both are crazy but only one is wishing for a new Crusades. Personally, as a person and an artist, I try to find ways to bridge divides and wish that was a more common approach. So, yeah, maybe “liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped” and maybe wokeness was annoying but back in 1946 Superman was shown punching Klansmen (the original idPol activists) and that was considered a good thing. Now are we supposed to just accept there are “good people on both sides” because the Heartland might get offended if we say such things are bad? What (if any) critique of so-called small town values is acceptable? Or is “this” only an acceptable mantra for one side? I have dual citizenship: rural Illinois and west coast port city. In my boonies the condescension is noticed and leaves a mark. President Garber’s official letter to the Harvard Community. Harvard has $55 billion endowment, more than enough to tell Trump to pound sand. F*cking cowards. Dear Members of the Harvard Community, Earlier today, the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism issued a letter putting at risk almost $9 billion in support of research at Harvard and other institutions, including hospitals in our community. If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation. The government has informed us that they are considering this action because they are concerned that the University has not fulfilled its obligations to curb and combat antisemitic harassment. We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry. Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus. I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university. For the past fifteen months, we have devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism. We have strengthened our rules and our approach to disciplining those who violate them. We have enhanced training and education on antisemitism across our campus and introduced measures to support our Jewish community and ensure student safety and security. We have launched programs to promote civil dialogue and respectful disagreement inside and outside the classroom. We have adopted many other reforms, and we will continue to combat antisemitism and to foster a campus culture that includes and supports every member of our community. We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission. Much is at stake here. In longstanding partnership with the federal government, we have launched and nurtured pathbreaking research that has made countless people healthier and safer, more curious and more knowledgeable, improving their lives, their communities, and our world. But we are not perfect. Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends—and to the teaching and research at the heart of our University—will not waver. Sincerely, Alan M. Garber Cowards indeed. They should have stood up on the hind legs when the slavering Elise Stefanik went after the college presidents. And that was when Biden was president, and I don’t remember that he objected to it at all. And not many other Democrats either. And from the letter, you can see that these universities have bought in 100% to the new definition of “antisemitism”. Really tired of all the liberal mewling about everything that’s going down right now, and then watching them do nothing at best, or help Trump along at worst (Thanks Chuckie!)

IMO you win the internet for the day. There must surely be groups collecting and breaking down which institutes across the country get cut down. And which do not. Just like nobody touching DoD. So I am waiting for Taibbi/Kirn to address that eventually… If protest won´t be supported at some point by institutions, i.e. party structures, unions, academia, churches the current movement won´t have any effect. Which I assume will be the case. Our Western societies have become so affluent that any serious urge to change has disappeared under the too many layers of wealth still entitled to by too many. If I am reading the news correctly, Trump intends to bomb Iran, seize Greenland, fight Venezuela, repel a Chinese takeover of Taiwan, continue the fight in Ukraine, and back Israeli genocide in gaza while bombing Somalia. Has he decided to go to war with everyone and see how it shakes out? Dude you missed Canada! Now our feelings are hurt, eh? And win the Nobel Peace Prize! On his own nomination! And tariff everyone on top of that. ‘vitrupo @vitrupo Instead of learning how to code, Replit CEO Amjad Masad says “learn how to think, learn how to break down problems, learn how to communicate clearly.” Is there an accreditation for this?

Thailand Says Collapsed Bangkok Tower Used Substandard Steel Bloomberg. The latest news I’ve seen is that four senior staff of the Chinese company that was the main construction partner have been arrested for (allegedly) trying to remove records from the site. I doubt if this could have been caused by substandard steel, even if it was used. A quick google indicates that the construction of the tower has been very troubled, with lots of delays. This can be highly problematic in building construction as there can be break in the ‘knowledge’ trail due to changes in staff/contractors after an unplanned pause, and if a building is left exposed you can have unexpected deterioration in structural fittings that were never intended to be exposed to the elements. For example, concrete has been laid, its very difficult to test if it was done correctly in the first place, and a pressurised sub-contractor may just assume that it had been done to legal standards by the previous contractor. As one engineer who had a business fixing concrete rot once said to me – ‘a good paper trail is not a guarantee of good concrete’. But it could have been just bad luck with timing, depending on the construction design. The basic frame may have been in place before stressing cross-braces were put in place, or the foundation may still have been open to allow ground works, before everything was concreted over. For the most part, most building codes apply to the finished building, not an interim structure (I confess to knowing zero about Thai construction codes, except that they are much weaker than most western countries, but substantially better than most poorer Asian countries). Construction here is not very good. Air conditioners do not have filters. Toilets do not have traps. Many tall-ish buildings do not have steel frames (there is a term of art, which I forget, but one floor is built on pillars, and then the next floor is built on top of that). And that’s before getting to the ability to make payments to smooth bureaucratic obstacles. Reinforced concrete framing, otherwise known as “Pancake Stacks.” We have a lot of reinforced concrete framing here in Uruguay, but we don’t have earthquakes. I really don’t think that the structures themselves are deficient, but that they tend to pancake during earthquakes. I remember the freeway that pancaked in San Francisco in the World series earthquake of 1989, Loma Prieta lazy load-bearing walls and earthquakes don’t mix….and it’s unfortunate that, like many parts of Asia and other parts of the world, the local authorities can’t codify safe practices which literally arose from the body count of early-industrial age (see Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire) Article mentions “steel bars” suggesting rebar, but maybe this is a translation thing and it’s structural steel forms. Reminds me of the 1031 Canal (Hard Rock Hotel) collapse in New Orleans in 2019 (I was there at the time). Seems like the design was fingered as the culprit. Or the FIU bridge collapse where the construction team changed the design without going back to the designers. I’ve been wading through Marc Andreesen’s “Techno optimists Manifesto”, Nick Land’s “Dark Enlightenment” and some of “Mencius Moldbug’s” writings. Their plan seems to have three parts. !) Destroy American Civil Society. 2) After a period of Civil unrest and Martial law which will “Right Size” the population, impose the Technate. 3) Paradise! I have few doubts that the first part will succeed, it is well underway and I see little opposition to date. The assumption that Civil unrest and “Right sizing” the population is going to be controllable seems unrealistic. And the assumption that our Techlords will be the only ones attempting to fill that political vacuum seems to ignore groups such as the Mormon Church, which is a State within the State. There are others… “If everything goes as planned” ignores the fact that Murphy always shows up at the party, invited or not. It won’t be boring. No kidding. These geniuses (genii?) possessing neither a drop of empathy nor any understanding of how humans work really think they can make this happen. Sure, they’ll just impose themselves on the populace whether the rabble likes it or not. They seriously can’t conceive of anyone opposing the gift of enlightenment they would bring. Certainly not any churches, organized crime groups, unions, militias (right, left and non-partisan), ethnic communities, rural communities, National Guard units who remained loyal to their states, etc. As someone said the other day, I’ve never seen a successful oligarchy with this many unemployed snipers around. They’ll learn too late why we went to the trouble to build civil society in the first place. It’s like ol’ Mencius was too busy trying on leather jackets for his photo ops to pick up a book on the Thirty Years War (which loomed large in the minds of the founders, I can assure everyone).

If you look at the title of the very first podcast in the list. The eyebrow-raiser – Dr. Ehrman actually was very much involved in the presentation of The Gospel of Judas to the public twenty or so years ago, and that was anything but a hoax. So, there is some ring of credibility there which made the joke all the more gripping. If you are interested, the entire podcast from today’s April Fool’s festivities was all about the most important hoaxes and forgeries of gospels and other Christian documents. It was actually quite enlightening. Just FYI, I have been reading and studying the Ancient Greek and Latin for decades. All of the ancient classical library of Greece and Rome and all of the Christian documents. Dr. Ehrman, of Duke University, an avowed atheist, is by far and away the best teacher and study guide for those interested in the koine Greek Christian canon. I always leave his lectures with more questions than answers. https://www.bartehrman.com/podcast/ An oldie but a goodie. A lot of people believed this was a true story at the time, including other news outlets not noticing it was in the April 1st edition of Sports Illustrated. / ;) https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/10/15/curious-case-sidd-finch via RACKET Another good doc-video on protest, by Ford Fischer / News2Share Protesters face off outside Tesla dealerships nationwide over Elon Musk’s “DOGE” 15 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkWwS4OE-0 The problem: If this is First Amendment the First Amendment is a joke. It´s a worthless token offered to the protest rabble to give them the feeling that they actually can do something. Which they can´t. In fact it´s an expression as it is a cover for and of total and utter powerlessness. Everyone doing some idiotic thing in public apparently invokes the First. The First provides the right to be a moron. Wow. Very helpful. That´s almost like protest against “the right” in Germany. Completely worthless. I doubt these people would be protesting in front of BMW or GM. Though those companies do not cause less destruction on the planet. Or of course take any multi. They say Musk. But they ought to say capitalism. But capitalism has again become the sacred cow of Jane and John Doe. Long live the First International. Oh? Is that why govt worked/works so hard to silence certain voices and threads via NGO cutout organizations? Because the 1st is a joke? Riiight…. I am all in for the First. And I am abhorred over what is going on in Germany (the only case I can judge). And I will always defend it. BUT: The fact that there is free speech – whatever its limits in Europe e.g. – what´s it worth? Did it stop us from inching towards WWIII? Does it stop a genocide committed as openly as ever? Does free speech stop the destruction of free speech on campuses in the US? Will it stop the destruction of labour via AI? Will it stop the increased concentration of capital? Will it stop climate “change”? I do for instance believe labour unions can achieve a few of these things. But when labour will in fact endanger the ruling order it will clash violently with state and corporate power. I.e. that labour will have to act well beyond the rights granted by free speech and arm itself. In the face of material force free speech in itself is worthless. That´s what facsism means. When free speech does threaten ruling power only on the surface you already can see what happens. They will use a tiny bit of judicial force to stop it. What if you push further? What if all BSW-voters in Germany had gone to the street and would have demanded a recount of the votes? What if protesters storm the US nuclear storage at Büchel base in Germany? Freedom of speech – or lets say diplomacy – did not help the Russians in preempting a war with 1.3M KIA on both sides. As Capone says in THE UNTOUCHABLES “With a gun and a nice word you achieve more than just a nice word.” What is free speech worth if we dare not question the capitalist structure underneath it? What is free speech worth if we have no means to enforce it against the state? What is free speech worth if the people who have the means to push for political change are so brain-washed that they in fact support the above mentioned WWIII policies or a genocide. Naturally this is a polemic comment and I am putting forward talking points which I still do not believe but I must contend with current realities. It is also a very personal reaction to the political fallout which we have experienced since 2024 in particular. As the necessity to resist couldn´t be more obvious. But never have we been further away from a viable political opposition with the Left – that usually held up that option – completely in tatters, or better, paid off. I am not argueing that we have completely run out of options with the use of free speech rights. But right now I am pessimistic it will in fact change anything beyond the cosmetic level. p.s. In his latest podcast Doug Henwood had two regulars as guests to his show. They spoke about the PMC. Henwood being Henwood I need not go into further detail. But there was this one point: The guests suggested that one reason for a possible demise of the genuine left originating in the 1960s was the idea of many academics then to change the system from the inside and decided to enter the system – after – and this is the interesting part – coming to the conclusion that the protest did not seriously end Vietnam but changes within the system did. I don´t know about the evidence for that. It´s complicated to prove any such point. Much of it being smart PR by pseudo-leftists I would suspect. I have all my life been in favour of protest. And I have always been of the opinion that protest (i.e. the First) did end Vietnam. But comments like this make me think. Especially if a Daniel Ellsberg 2 years ago mused that may be it was not the protest that brought down Nixon, not his own Pentagon Paper leaks and not a seminal SCOTUS decision “NYT & Co vs. US” – but a Howard Dean. Howard Dean, or John Dean? “Of course John Dean. What did you think. I was only testing you.” Shit. Thanks. Sorry. I seem to like making these slips… and it´s not the first time with Dean. And I really don´t know why. My memory of Howard Dean is very murky. Mine too!! Poor guy. He didn´t deserve it, did he? I do believe he opposed Iraq. p.s. Who among D.C.s big shots today opposed Iraq??? (AOC I assume wasn´t even born, so she´s lucky and excused.) Yes, I’m sure he did. Obama sure didn’t. He wasn’t that great on Universal Health care for everyone though I did work for him at the time.It was an optimistic campaign.

Goodbye Al Udeid! We won’t miss you! Prosecutors directed to seek death penalty against UnitedHealthcare killing suspect Luigi Mangione AP “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statement. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” And thus are Martyrs made. “Brian Thompson—an innocent man” Only because he was never charged for his crimes. The wealthy sins and mistakes, which all need forgiveness, while the poor have crimes and sins, which are unforgivable and require punishment. Money really does wash away one’s guilt. It may have “shocked” the powers that be and the oligarchs in charge, but down here on the ground “shocked” isn’t the word I’d use to describe the reaction.

And they couldn’t even cover their tracks? Amateurs, mere amateurs. Sigh. There is a lot to say and the case is still developing. But French law is pretty strict on the financing of political parties, and there have been a number of similar prosecutions in recent years. Former President Sarkozy, already convicted of fiddling election expenses, is on trial for receiving campaign contributions from Libya amounting to millions of Euros, at least. But the point here is not the crime (which is pretty well established) but the punishment. The judge had a great deal of discretion in the punishment awarded, and opted for the harshest available: disqualification with immediate effect, even while an appeal is being mounted. That means that Le Pen cannot present herself in 2027, it means that the party itself probably won’t be able to find another candidate, and that the whole complexion of French politics has just been altered by one judge who could easily have awarded a sentence that was less harsh. Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence. >”Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence.” Which does confirm a Walter Kirn (sorry to bother with him who is no expert on foreign affairs) who I have criticized just yesterday for alluding to this very problem. I cross-posted this with yesterdays article on not accepting or sending checks for US taxes… Holy mackerel! I was reviewing the US Treasury’s Daily Statement trying to get a picture of tax inflows from tariffs from a before perspective. While I was reviewing it I came across 2 line items that when viewed together shocked me… (fiscal year to date numbers)… inflows/deposits to the Treasury… Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Electronic $164,358M Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Other $126,061M These line items relate to taxes paid by individuals that were not withheld from payroll or collected in advance for other reasons… the money owed after you complete your return if you did not receive a refund. While I’m not 100% confident I have identified the best/fullest answer, but from what I’ve been able to glean the difference between Electronic and Other is tied to whether you filed your return electronically of via paper where “Other” is primarily paper filed returns. I’d suspect they call it Other because it likely also includes legal judgements regardless of your original type of filing. While it is technically possible to file on paper and pay electronically via the IRS web portal, I would highly suspect the correlation is that paper filings include a paper check! At least at the dollar level, the ratio is 1 : .75. That’s a lot of paper checks (or their dollar equivalent) to force to electronic payment in the next 6 months or so! While I do suspect some of those paper returns & checks are very high dollar value, I still think it directionally points to a significant volume of people who are paying their taxes in paper check form (or equivalent such as a money order). Don’t know, but like lots of people without W-2 income or mandatory 1099 withholding I make estimated tax payment by check throughout the year. I did notice my 15 Jan check processed by Cincinnati came back as “converted to ACH”. Think that’s a first. Hope Hawaii doesn’t jump on this bandwagon. We pay some business taxes. They keep raising the tax so for one period we got fined for exceeding the dollar limit where you have to file electronically. So now we file electronically but the limit for mandatory electronic payment is higher (and with “convenience fee”) so we still pay by check. Had a three-month span where we were getting dinged for non-payment. Had to call and fax copies of the cleared checks (thankfully, not converted to ACH so you can still get an image of front/back of actual check). No, I’m not going to Zelle my IRS payment. re: Germany vs. Gaza Germany Turns to U.S. Playbook: Deportations Target Gaza War Protesters Objections from a top immigration official that none of the protesters were convicted of crimes were overruled amid political pressure. https://theintercept.com/2025/03/31/germany-gaza-protesters-deport/ A question for the commentariat: What are the power centers in the America of today?

Title: As Future of Panama Canal Hangs in Balance, Mexico Quietly Begins Testing Its Interoceanic Rail Corridor
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/04/as-future-of-panama-canal-hangs-in-balance-mexico-quietly-inaugurates-its-interoceanic-rail-corridor.html

Full Content:
South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just became the first company to use the rail corridor, which is being touted as a possible plan B to the embattled canal. Just a few weeks ago, the Trump Administration was celebrating what seemed to be an early strategic victory over China in the US’ direct neighbourhood. As readers may recall, a consortium led by the investment fund manager BlackRock had just announced its purchase of 80 percent of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port holdings, giving the consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, including, crucially, the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal. The sale of CK Hutchison’s ports business put “the ports [in Panama] under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane,” noted an Associated Press article. The message was clear: the Trump Administration is not going to stand by and watch as China expands its influence in the US’s own “backyard”, especially over strategic assets like the Panama Canal. To put this in broader context, the attempted buy out of the Panamanian ports came just three months after the opening of the Chinese-financed and -managed deep sea port in Chancay, which as Asia Times reported, signalled “the start of a new era of efficient, high-capacity shipping between China and Peru, with a connection to Brazil across the Andes.” As a measure of Chancay’s importance to the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping even travelled to Peru to inaugurate the mega port (as well as attend the 31st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Lima), where he said: “We are witnessing not only the solid and successful joint implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in Peru, but also the birth of a new land-maritime corridor between Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean in a new era.” Of course, this caused all sort of teeth gnashing in Washington, especially given that Chancay is more advanced than any seaport in the US. Within weeks, US officials were signing a strategic agreement with Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa government that allows the US to install military personnel, weapons and other equipment on the Galapagos islands, a UNESCO Natural Heritage Site in a country whose constitution expressly prohibits the establishment of foreign military bases. The island chain is 1,900 kms from Chancay. Since its inauguration, Trump 2.0 has upped the stakes, showing a clear willingness to use every conceivable tactic, including gangster extortion, to stymie Chinese influence on the American continent, particularly in Mexico and Central America. As Conor recently reported, the Trump administration’s obsession with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure extends beyond the American continent: Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. “Selling Out” the Chinese People Against this complex backdrop, the BlackRock-led consortium’s purchase of CK Hutchison’s port holdings (outside of China and Hong Kong) was set to be consummated with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction by April 2 — that is, tomorrow. But that, alas, will not be happening, at least not any time soon, since Beijing has decided that it, too, can play dirty on the global chessboard. Last week, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said it plans to “review [the sale] in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. As the FT reports, the move came on the back of earlier commentary in the Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, that called the sale a “spineless, grovelling” move that “sells out all Chinese people”. The agreement “in principle” was announced in early March, with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction expected by April 2. However, this is now set to be delayed, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yesterday, the newspaper featured comments from Hong Kong politicians and Chinese lawyers urging the CK Hutchison to rethink the sale of its ports division, which is kind of ironic given that the main point of the sale was to “de-risk” its port holdings. Now, it is caught in the middle of a bitch fight between the world’s two superpowers, for which it has already paid a heavy price. Since news of Beijing’s objections to the sale broke on March 13, the company’s shares have fallen 13%, retracing more than half of the 25% gain after the deal’s announcement. One Ta Kung Pao editorial even suggested that the sale could contravene Hong Kong’s national security laws, known as Article 23. If, as the FT notes, the deal were ultimately blocked, it could have major repercussions not only for Beijing’s already troubled relations with Hong Kong’s business elite but also Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre: CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing and his family, has increasingly been caught between Beijing and Washington over the Panama ports since US President Donald Trump complained of Chinese influence over the canal and said the US would be “taking it back”. It is unusual for a Chinese state agency to review a deal involving a Hong Kong-based company. CK Hutchison’s holding company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the conglomerate’s ports in China are excluded from the sale. “Is this a warning shot to others or a look to scuttle this deal?” one person familiar with the deal said. “On paper, the SAMR reviewing how this deal affects the Chinese shipping industry under its anti-monopoly mandate makes a lot of sense. But does anyone really believe that or is this . . . the Chinese scuttling a deal which will then have ramifications on Hong Kong as a financial centre?” “Torpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser at the IMF. “The risks are so high for all involved.” The End of the Belt-and-Road in Panama The deal represented a triumph for the Trump Administration’s geostrategic aspirations in its own neighbourhood as well as a blow to China’s belt-and-road project, given that some 6% of global trade passes through the canal. According to the US International Trade Commission, the Canal “has 46% of the total market share of containers moving from Northeast Asia to the East Coast of the United States.” Panama itself was the first country in Latin America to join China’s Belt-and-Road initiative, in 2017. However, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, under pressure from US Sec of State Marco Rubio, recently said he would withdraw Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review. The CK Hutchison deal was also supposed to mark a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions. According to Bloomberg, Fink had personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The billionaire CEO reportedly boasted of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. But apparently not in Beijing. For Trump, the deal was all about “reclaiming” the canal for the United States — a message that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not gone down well in Panama. This is a country wearily accustomed to US military interventions, the last of which took place in 1989 with George H W Bush’s invasion and toppling of Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama’s strong arm dictator (1983-9) and former CIA asset and go-between during the US’ dirty wars in Central America. Much like Saddam Hussein a few years later, Noriega thought he could go his own way. Trump has repeatedly denounced that US ships pay exorbitant prices to transit the waterway, though they, in fact, pay the same rates as ships of any other flag. But the deal is now on ice anyway, meaning that other options, including military ones, are back on the table. US-Style “Partnering” With Panama Even before Chinese regulators put the stick in the spokes, the Trump Administration had already directed the US military to draw up plans to increase the American troop presence in Panama, according to information leaked to NBC. As the NBC article notes, the amount of military force used will depend on the extent to which Panama is willing to, ahem, “partner” with the US: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Trump seems to believe that the US has, at the very least, joint, if not full, ownership rights over the canal due to the fact that the US government and banks financed its construction between 1904 and 1914. What happened just before 1904 is often forgotten or overlooked, however. The veteran US journalist Ken Silverstein jogged a few memories in his 2014 article for Vice, : “In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia into handing over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them JP Morgan & Co, which was appointed as the country’s ‘fiscal agent’ in charge of managing $10m in aid that the US had rushed down to the new nation.” US interests were myriad: on the one hand, Washington wanted access to, and control over, the canal that French builders had begun but failed to finish in the 1880s. At the same time, Wall Street banks were keen to create a new nation that would primarily serve their interests. As John Pilger reported for The Guardian in 2016, it was JP Morgan that would lead the American banks in gradually transforming Panama into “a financial centre – and a haven for tax evasion and money laundering – as well as a passage for shipping.” Washington maintained control of the interoceanic waterway until 1977 during which time when then-US President Jimmy Carter signed with the then Panamanian leader, Omar Torrijos, the cession of US control of the facility 22 years later. The agreement came after years of protests in Panama against US occupation but was widely criticised by US conservatives at the time and is seen by Trump as a “serious mistake.” But the Panama Canal has lost some of its lustre since the jungle country suffered an unprecedented drought in 2023. As we noted a few weeks ago, the BlackRock-led consortium’s participation in the canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). As Tom Neuburger wrote in a Jan 2024 article we cross-posted here, the plans to “fix” the Canal sound like plans to “fix” the climate: Bill Gates-style high tech fantasies. [Bloomberg] “In the long term, the primary solution to chronic water shortages will be to dam up the Indio River and then drill a tunnel through a mountain to pipe fresh water 8 kilometers (5 miles) into Lake Gatún, the canal’s main reservoir.” That’s a $2 billion project if it comes in on budget. But is it a long-term fix? Bloomberg admits that Panama “will need to dam even more rivers to guarantee water through the end of the century.” Sounds like Band-Aids to me. Lots of them. And residents of the to-be-flooded land are vigorously opposed, so it will be a political fight to move them. “Another potential fix is decidedly more experimental … cloud seeding, the process of implanting large salt particles into clouds to boost the condensation that creates rain.” The article is not optimistic that this will work. Another Gatesian dream: Pretty. Impossible. Or to say that differently, pretty impossible. Plan B Option: Mexico? As the future of the Panama Canal hangs in the balance, Mexico has begun pilot testing the Interoceanic Rail Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (also known by its Spanish initials, CIIT). On Friday, a ship chartered by the Hyundai Motor Company docked at the Pacific port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca. Its cargo, 600 Hyundai vehicles, were unloaded and placed on a freight train that then set off across the Isthmus, Mexico’s narrowest land bridge, to the port of Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, where the cargo was loaded onto another boat destined for the US’ East Coast. And just like that, the first genuine rival route, or perhaps better put, complementary route, to the Panama Canal was born. Or perhaps better put, reborn. You see, most of the infrastructure for the project was built over a century ago. In fact, the 188-mile railroad joining the two main ports was opened in 1907, seven years before the inauguration of the Panama Canal, and within no time was plying as many as 60 trains a day carrying things like sugar from the Caribbean on their way to the US West Coast. But its success was short lived. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the railroads were increasingly used to transport weapons and troops rather than freight. Four years later, the Panama Canal opened, offering a more attractive route to international businesses. Gradually, over time Mexico’s interoceanic railroad system fell into disrepair, and while recent governments in Mexico have talked about rebooting the system, it wasn’t until Andrés Manuel López Obrador (aka AMLO) took power in 2018 that the words actually turned into action. As we reported in September 2023, if completed and done well, it will probably represent the most important infrastructure project of Lopéz Obrador’s presidency. The goal is not just to turn Mexico into a logistics powerhouse but also to spread wealth across the country by boosting economic opportunities in Mexico’s poorer, long-neglected southern states (Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, etc). This will largely be through the development of ten industrial parks, or so-called “free zones”, along the route. The project will also include the construction of four new highways, three airports, a gas pipeline and a fibre-optic network, and already boasts a ten-stop passenger train service. As the problems stack up in Panama, other interoceanic land routes are coming under consideration, including a rival canal in neighbouring Nicaragua, which almost got built instead of the Panama Canal at the turn of the 20th century, as well as interoceanic rail corridors in Honduras and Colombia. But for the moment Mexico’s CIIT has one clear advantage over all these other projects: it is close to completion, and that is largely thanks to all the work undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “An Exceptional Project” While the journey time of the CIIT (6-7 hours) is slightly shorter than the Panama Canal (8-10 hours), you also have to add in the time it takes to load and unload thousands of shipping containers off a ship onto a train and then back on to a ship at the other end. According to a video report by the Wall Street Journal in September last year, “Mexico still has a lot of work to do to get its ports ready for a large influx of cargo”. This was a point that President Sheinbaum herself addressed in her Monday morning press conference: “Several very important cranes are about to arrive. There will also be a storage facility for grains that is also important, and other actions to strengthen the port of Salina Cruz and that will allow freer movement. It is an exceptional project that provides an alternative to the Panama Canal, and when the port of Salina Cruz is complete, it will have much more activity.” The total transit time for the Hyundai cargo was around 72 hours, according to local sources. Granted, this was the first pilot test carried out with a large cargo of vehicles but it still compares unfavourably with the Panama Canal — unless of course one takes into account the possible waiting times for ships before passage through the canal, which during periods of low rain can mean days or even weeks of hanging around off Panama’s coastline. During the 2023 drought, waiting times reached as long as 14 days, leaving some carriers little choice but to bid millions in extra fees to jump the line. Another advantage of the CIIT for a shipment from, say, South Korea to New York is that you wouldn’t have to go all the way down to Panama, navigate the canal and then go all the way back up again. Also, the long-term goal of Mexico’s interoceanic rail corridor is to bring the journey time down to low double or even single-digit figures as the logistics systems at the two ports gain in efficiency. According to the WSJ report, it should ultimately take around 15 hours for cargos to pass through Mexico. But as Mexican journalist Agustín García Villa notes, the success of a project of this scale and grandeur will require many things, including a trained workforce, technology, super-rapid processing of containers at the ports (which is good for all businesses, including, of course, drug trafficking ones), reliable energy sources, and the development of properly urbanised mid-sized cities that guarantee an adequate supply of housing, schools, hospitals, health centres, energy and markets. It will also depend on the amount of security Mexico’s marines can provide to the strategic infrastructure. All of that, in turn, will require a steady flow of significant investment as well as long-term political commitment. The former is, for the moment, amply covered, with money coming in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. Put simply, big business, not just from the US, wants this project to happen. So, too, does the Claudia Sheinbaum government, which took over the reins of power from AMLO last October. Ultimately, as the WSJ report concludes, Mexico’s re-emerging interoceanic rail corridor is unlikely to rival Panama Canal in terms of capacity or speed of transit even once complete. But it could serve as a very useful complement. As Doctor Yasmine Sabri, associate professor of logistics at University College London, tells the WSJ, rather than competing with each other, perhaps the two could work together by sharing data, enabling them to reroute vessels whenever there is a chokepoint, whether it is in Panama or Mexico. However, big questions still remain. For instance, how much opposition will the construction of industrial parks in Oaxaca and Veracruz face from local indigenous communities? If there is strong resistance, how will the Sheinbaum government respond? Like AMLO before her, Sheinbaum prides herself on representing indigenous rights and voices. It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project as and when it gradually comes on line. Of course, Trump will have somewhat more difficulty bullying Mexico into submission than it did Panama, but it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention. Will Chinese companies be interested in investing in the industrial parks along the route, as it has done in so many other infrastructure projects in southern Mexico? Much will depend on whether Mexico continues to serve as a point of entry for competitively priced manufactured goods into the US market, which cannot be taken for granted. Of course, Washington will try to talk Mexico out of accepting any offers of Chinese funds. Mexico, like Panama, finds itself caught in a tussle between two apex superpowers, and is already paying a heavy price. US pressure to impose equivalent tariffs on Chinese goods continues to rise. To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam. If the Trump administration does try to impose its will on Mexico’s re-emerging trade route as it has tried to do with the Panama Canal, so far unsuccessfully, it will heap even further pressure on the rapidly fracturing global trade system. And if this goes on for long enough, global trade volumes will ultimately begin to fall, perhaps even obviating the need for so many transoceanic trade routes in the first place. “It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project…it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention.” I recall seeing a report somewhere that five guys in a boat were seen leaving the Baltic Sea and heading south into the Atlantic Ocean, carrying several strange tall objects about the height of ICBM’s as cargo. But to what ends is Trump trying to control China? The majority of the ships through the Panama Canal go to the US. Many go from east to west coast of the US. Some from Europe to west coast, others Asia to east coast. And since the US is a major importer, any shutting of the canal/ports would hurt the US more than China. While he might not care, I’m not so sure the vast majority of Americans won’t. The rail would allow the largest MGX-24 (24,000 TEU) to dock. As they are way to big for the canal. From what can find a fully automated port can load/empty 24k in 12 hrs. I wonder how the costs of doing this is vs the cost of the canal transit and adding many days of waiting time? Well, it seems unlikely that the port will be as well run under BlackRock (who will be incentivized to run it down and then dump the mess on the US govt) than under its current CHinese management. See what BlackRock and its ilk have done to US health care and so many other industries – maximize profit, enshitify service, skip maintenance. Waiting to use the word ‘enshitify’ so late in that excellent point was a class move. Thanks for the lesson. It’s an interesting project and more so because it is an updated 19th century scheme. It will never replace the canal but that is not it’s intent. I can see it being used to ship cargo on a reliable timetable which is no longer true of the Panama canal due to problems with water supplies declining which the canal needs to operate. You know what might be interesting? If China came in and built a high-speed rail running parallel the the cargo railway to connect up all those communities in that corridor. Thanks for the great report. It may be time to consider whether the defeat of the last administration was a blow to hegemony–the “blob”–or has brought us hegemony on steroids as embodied in one very flawed personality and his increasingly sycophantic staff. So far hegemony 2 consists of the considerable hot air that comes out of Trump’s mouth but should he indeed start a war with Iran, or even Panama, it will be the American people who will also suffer as we join Netanyahu in the rogue nation category. The public tolerated and even applauded “we’re an empire now” under the Bush Jr. regime but then had considerable buyer’s remorse as Iraq and Afghanistan turned sour and endless. The Dems got it wrong about Trump who is nothing like Hitler but may be very much like the foolish Kaiser Wilhelm with his obsession with his costumes and inferiority complex. The adults running Trump’s many would be targets need to assert themselves and seem to be doing so. Moon suggests a walkback of Trump’s unhinged Sunday rant toward Putin https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/03/russigates-role-in-trump-putin-relations.html So is it another “360” by the Donald? Or is he merely willing to be reasonable with nuclear armed Russia but not all those “shitty little countries” as he called them like Yemen and Panama? Is it still kick down/suck up? The psychodrama is getting old fast. If you’re ever in Panama City, I urge you to visit the Canal Museum. Quietly–movingly–it underscores the incredible racism that underlay the canal’s construction, beginning to end, the 27,000-plus deaths that came with it. The entire world thinks that Panama runs the canal better than we did and the Panamanian people (including my students there during the summer of ’23) are proud of the fact. Incidents like the murder of 22 students who wanted to fly their country’s flag at Balboa High School in the Canal Zone in 1964–not to mention the flattening, with more than 200 completely unnecessary deaths, of the poor Panama City El Chorillo neighborhood during our invasion–are not forgotten. We forget how hard it is to invade and hold a country. We will find out once more if we choose to go into places like Iran or Panama. Very rough math: For a 20,000 TEU (assume max container ship) = 20,000 TEUs / 250 TEUs per train = 80 trains to move containers from coast to coast. For a 5,000 car Ro-Ro, 12 cars per autorack, 417 autorack rail cars, so about 4.5 trains. Loading/unloading autoracks/Ro-Ro is much faster than loading containers too, maybe about 24 hours turnaround. So it looks to me like it’s feasible for autos and probably bulk, but perhaps not for containers and intermodal? I guess i am behind the curve. “To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam.” But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place. Wasn’t Obambam excluding China from the TPP when he was in office? Then Hillary finally came out against the TPP at the end of her campaign? “But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place.” My guess is that Chinese steel enters Malaysia and Vietnam through the already deep trade ties Beijing has with these countries, and then some of that steel ends up heading towards Mexico under the preferential conditions of the TPP. The economist Robert E Scott warned about this happening wrt the US in an article for the Economic Policy Institute in late 2016, just months before Trump walked away from the deal. Here’s the intro: President Obama has built his closing case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a political argument, saying “…we can’t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules.” But it is both arrogant and wrong to think that the United States has the power to shape the rules governing China’s relationship to TPP signatories. As of today, China has already established deeper trade ties than the United States with the TPP nations. Further, congressional approval of the TPP would actually lock in those advantages for China. China has a large trade surplus with the TPP countries, and crucial terms of the agreement (specifically weak rules of origin (ROO) requirements, which we’ll talk about in detail below) would provide a back-door guarantee for China and other non-TPP members to duty-free access to U.S. and other TPP markets. Thanks Nick Vera Cruz is the starting point for past invasions of Mexico (Cortes, re the Conquest & General Scot re Mexico _US treaty of Gaudalupe Hidalgo). In 1900, work started on the Kansas City, Mexico , and Orient Railway (now El Chepe in Mexico across the Copper Canyon) which was to connect the US to the Pacific. The advantage of the Mexican connecection is that if the land transit times are short and if the offloading/loading logistics are efficient, then Pacific (Asia) -Mexico boats could carry loads a shorter direction in both directions. Like wise , boats leaving Vera Cruz could consolidate their Pacific cargo for points towards the Atlantic , etc. Also, in November Nicarauga President Ortega proposed to China to build a Atlantic/Pacific Canal through that country. The Panama Canal is not without its difficulties. Be careful what you wish for, if the US ‘reclaims’, it gets to service the operation, etc. Don’t understand the importance of Balboa and Cristobal (container I assume?) ports to cross-canal shipping? Have some interest as my father was stationed in Coco Solo during WWII as a flying boat engine mechanic. He also deployed with a detachment from his squadron to the Galapagos Islands which was used as a flying boat logistics center (in the last half of the war Japanese subs were considered the primary threat). So its not like a US base in Galapagos is something new (Army Air Force also had a bomber base there). From the Galapagos Conservancy: The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 enhanced the strategic importance of the Galapagos Islands as a potential refueling station for trans-oceanic transport. In 1911, the US suggested a 99-year lease of the islands in return for US$15 million. Later, the US and Ecuador discussed the rental or purchase of San Cristóbal, or of the whole archipelago. With the advent of the Second World War, the strategic significance of Galapagos grew, and, in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and with concern about Japanese actions in East Asia, the US approached Ecuador with the idea of establishing a US airbase on Baltra Island to protect the Panama Canal. At the end of 1941, US forces arrived from the Panama Canal Zone. In 1942, the US Sixth Air Force constructed the air base which was to have important long-term consequences for the islands. In 1943, this base was home to 2,474 US officers and men and 750 civilian laborers; as such, this was the largest colonization of the islands to that date. In 1941, the civilian population of the Galapagos Islands was 810 people. The arrival of so many people increased the demand for water, fish, and agricultural products, and threw a lifeline to the people eking out a livelihood on the islands. Base crews constructed a water pipeline from the highlands to Wreck Bay, in San Cristóbal, and used barges to transport water to Baltra Island. The availability of water in Wreck Bay made San Cristóbal more attractive to immigration and meant that people could move down to live in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. The greatest legacy was the construction of the first land-based airport in the islands—now modernized to serve as the main entry point for most travelers to the Galapagos Islands. The US closed the air base in 1946; residents dismantled the structures left behind, using the components to build many of the early houses in Puerto Ayora and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Also, in 2023, over a year before Trump 2.0 took power, the head of the US Southern Command, Laura Richardson, underscored the Chinese presence in critical infrastructure in Latin America as a threat to US national security and hence the importance of maritime dominance to counter it. She highlighted the presence of five Chinese companies along the Panama Canal and the strategic value of the new port in Chancay, Peru. Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink Says Bitcoin to Outperform USD: New Crypto to Ride the Next Rally

BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, says that the US dollar risks losing its dominance to Bitcoin, a sentiment shared by political heavyweights like Senator Cynthia Lummis. We take a look at how pro-crypto assertions like these could help rally the market and fuel new crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). ‘If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,’ Fink stated in his annual letter to investors. The letter touched upon several core problems that plague US society today, including the average American’s poor financial literacy and the need to democratize investments. Fink warned that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and gradual public adoption over the years could soon threaten the supremacy of the US dollar: The solution to the US’s current financial and economic problems, Fink believes, can be found in digital assets because ‘tokenization is democratization’ and Bitcoin leads the way. That these statements come from BlackRock lends even more weight, knowing that the company’s trademark iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds over 570K $BTC, worth over $48B. Furthermore, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund has received a series of $USDC inflows, with the latest valued at $7M, for a total of $33M over the past three days. If tokenization is the future, Blackrock is already there. Staunch crypto advocate, Senator Lummis echoes Fink’s views on X. After announcing the Bitcoin Act back in July 2024, meant to increase the US Federal Reserve’s Bitcoin pool to over $1M, she clapped back at Congress yesterday for not passing the Act fast enough. She then pressed the gas pedal one post later with a blunt: ‘Say it with me: Pass the BITCOIN Act.’ in response to Fink’s statements. The signs are clear: no matter how bearish the markets are right now, the crypto sphere is entering an era of unprecedented top-level support and widespread adoption, with $BTC leading the way. In this context, it’s good to keep an eye on some of the best new crypto that could be part of the next bull run. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project with ambitions to upgrade Solana’s ecosystem and deliver lower fees and faster on-chain transactions. The project promises to rectify core problems with Solana’s current performance, like failed transactions, long downtimes during network outages, and frequent network congestion. As the team achieves its milestones, the devs post regular updates on their work schedule. The latest update focused on their collaboration with Sovereign to achieve faster transaction processing and greater TPS (Transactions per Second). The presale is ongoing, having raised over $28M so far, with the price of $SOLX sitting at $0.00168. This strong early performance makes it one of the best presales in 2025, along with the 142% APY designed to attract stakers and early investors. Tokenomics data: Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the most promising meme coins, thanks to its links to Bitcoin proper. The project attracts investors with long-term $BTC airdrops, each coming at key $BTC price points ($150K, $200K, etc.), and if you hold the tokens in Best Wallet. $BTBULL was born from the idea that $BTC will eventually reach and surpass the $1M market evaluation. As such, the developer team aims to hype up investors to support Bitcoin’s bull run, in turn, dragging Bitcoin Bull Token along for the ride. The presale has raised $4.3M so far, with the $BTCBULL price sitting at a still super low $0.00244. Staking is at 97% currently, with a staking pool of over 1B. Tokenomics data: OpenSea ($SEA) is the first and biggest NFT marketplace in the game. If you want to buy, sell, and mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art, collectibles, music, virtual property, this is the place to be. The company launched its beta in February of this year and recommends itself as a ‘fully reimagined product’ for NFT collectors and pro investors. It promises to bring several key features, including native cross-chain purchasing, 0% swap fees, and an unmatched collection of different markets. $SEA is set to have its public launch in 2025, but it doesn’t have an official date yet. Until that happens, you can interact with the OpenSea world right now if you’re a fan of tokenized art. All three covered above are viable new token projects to keep an eye on as the crypto verse expands. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin will rally, but when. After all, we live in a universe where financial mammoths like Blackrock and US political figures like Cynthia Lummis are pushing hard for adoption while highlighting Bitcoin’s superiority over USD. Who would’ve believed it back in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published his little 9-page paper, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’? As always, there’s no holding back progress. That said, this is not financial advice. DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before investing and have a solid risk management strategy in place to minimize losses.

Title: Forbes’ 39th Annual World’s Billionaires List: More Than 3,000 Worth $16 Trillion
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2025/04/01/forbes-39th-annual-worlds-billionaires-list-more-than-3000-worth-16-trillion/

ByChase Peterson-Withorn ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. The world’s billionaires have always been rich and powerful—but never more than now. That’s particularly true in the United States, where Donald Trump was sworn in (again) as America’s billionaire-in-chief in January. This time around, he’s giving the billionaire class more control over the government than ever before. His right-hand man is the planet’s richest person. His administration includes at least ten billionaires and billionaire spouses. And scores of billionaire execs—from Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault—have lined up behind Trump. The billionaire bonanza extends beyond the U.S., however. A record 3,028 people around the globe make Forbes’ annual World’s Billionaires list this year, 247 more than last year. It’s the first time the billionaire population has crossed the 3,000 mark. They’re worth a record $16.1 trillion in all, $2 trillion more than a year ago and more than the GDP of every country in the world besides the U.S. and China. The average fortune now stands at $5.3 billion, up $200 million from 2024. There are now three people worth more than $200 billion for the first time ever, part of the record 15 members of the $100 Billion Club, the elite group at the very top of the list whose net worths span a dozen digits. That’s up from 14 a year ago and none in 2017. These 15 centibillionaires are worth $2.4 trillion—more than the bottom 1,500 billionaires combined. The richest of all is Elon Musk, worth an estimated $342 billion. Despite spending a lot more of his (already divided) time heading DOGE, Trump’s cost-cutting operation, Musk has added $147 billion to his fortune over the past year, thanks to a blockbuster year for his rocket company SpaceX and his AI firm xAI (which he merged with his social media giant X last week). Even Tesla, despite recent protests and a stock market selloff, is trading higher than a year ago. That’s allowed Musk to reclaim the title of world’s richest person from Arnault, and has given him a $126 billion lead over the next richest person: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $216 billion), who ranks No. 2 for the first time. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($215 billion) ranks No. 3 and Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($192 billion) ranks fourth. Arnault ($178 billion), meanwhile, slides down to fifth, his lowest rank since 2017, amid a slump in shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH. Forbes used stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025 for this year’s ranking. The United States, with a record 902 billionaire citizens, continues to boast more billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. China, with 516 (including Hong Kong), remains second and India, with 205, still ranks third. More than 50% of all listees are citizens of one of these three countries, but altogether 76 nations and two semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire, including Albania for the first time ever. Forbes also added 15 from Saudi Arabia this year, after removing the Kingdom’s billionaires in 2018 following a government crackdown. In all, 288 fresh faces join the annual Billionaires ranking this year. That includes celebrities such as rockstar Bruce Springsteen ($1.2 billion), movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1.1 billion) and comedian Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion). Also new: controversial crypto kingpin Justin Sun ($8.5 billion), several artificial intelligence tycoons from such companies as Anthropic, CoreWeave and DeepSeek, and the moguls behind several notable food chains: Cava, Chipotle, Jersey Mike’s and Zaxby’s. The wealthiest newcomer of all is Marilyn Simons ($31 billion), the widow of hedge fund legend Jim Simons, who died in May 2024. He was one of 32 billionaires who died over the past year. (Another, Israeli industrial titan Stef Wertheimer, died in late March, after we locked in the list, and thus appears in the ranks.) Simons is one of just 406 women among the World’s Billionaires, only 13.4% of the list, up a hair from 13.3% last year. Nearly three-quarters inherited their fortunes. That includes the world’s richest woman, Walmart heir Alice Walton ($101 billion), who has overtaken French L’Oreal heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion) for the top spot among women. Forbes found just 113 self-made women around the globe, the richest of whom is Swiss shipping tycoon Rafaela Aponte-Diamant ($37.7 billion) whose company teamed with BlackRock this year on a plan to buy 43 ports, including two in Panama. Overall, 67% of the list is self-made—meaning they founded or cofounded their company or established their own fortune, rather than inheriting it—up from 66% in 2024. The youngest self-made billionaire is Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), who is 28. Wang is one of just 21 billionaires who are 30 or younger, including Johannes von Baumbach ($5.4 billion), a 19-year-old heir to a German pharmaceuticals fortune, a newcomer who is now the world’s youngest billionaire. The oldest billionaire, at age 103, is U.S. insurance tycoon George Joseph ($1.9 billion), one of four listees who have hit the century mark. The average billionaire is 66 years old. Few billionaires have had a better year than Donald Trump—and not just because he retook the U.S. presidency. Before moving back into the White House, he padded his cash pile with a very lucrative move into crypto. Between that and his Trump Media & Technology Group going public just after Forbes locked in its 2024 rankings, the president’s net worth has more than doubled, from an estimated $2.3 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion. A small handful of billionaires, relatively speaking, didn’t fare so well. A total of 107 people who were on the 2024 ranking are simply no longer rich enough to make the cut. Notable drop-offs include Lisa Su, who is the CEO of semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sara Liu, cofounder of embattled server and storage maker Supermicro; and Nicholas Puech, an heir to the Hermès luxury goods empire who says his fortune has vanished. The World’s Billionaires list is a ranking of every person on the planet who Forbes estimated to have a net worth of $1 billion U.S. dollars or more as of March 7, 2025. Some billionaires have gotten richer or poorer in the time since; indeed, Forbes found three more billionaires shortly after locking in this year’s list and there are likely more out there. Like most of our readers, we’re also bracing for the impact of tariffs on the global stock market. For daily updated rankings, see Forbes’ Real-Time tracker. When possible, we met with billionaires in person or spoke with them virtually or by phone. We also interviewed their employees, handlers, asset managers and financial advisors, rivals, peers and attorneys. Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory documents, court filings, probate records and news articles. We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more. We factored in known debt and charitable giving. We exclude dispersed family fortunes, though we list wealth belonging to the immediate family of the living founder of a fortune under the founder’s name. In some cases, we also include wealth held by the immediate family member of an heir. In either of those instances, you’ll see “& family” in a person’s listing. For the full list of the world’s 3,028 billionaires, see here.
