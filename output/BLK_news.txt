Title: Why The 60/40 Portfolio Needs Bitcoin In Today’s Market

Metallic Bitcoin symbol with financial chart over dark background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] selective focus and copy space. If you happen to be a Bitcoin skeptic, you’re not alone. A recent Pew Research survey found that 63% of Americans are not confident in the reliability or safety of cryptocurrencies in general. But when BlackRock speaks, it often pays to listen. In its just-released 2025 Global Outlook report, the world’s largest asset management firm lays out a case for Bitcoin not only as a diversifier alongside gold but also a strategic hedge against an environment where the historical stock-bond correlation is breaking down. For decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio—60% stocks, 40% bonds—was the gold standard of diversification. When stocks crashed, as they did during the dotcom bubble and global financial crisis, bonds usually rose in value, providing a cushion against market volatility. But we’re in a new regime now where this correlation has become increasingly unreliable. If you recall, 2022 was the worst year on record for U.S. stocks and bonds. BlackRock identifies this trend and suggests that investors need to look beyond government bonds for diversification. This is where gold and Bitcoin come into play. Both assets offer unique advantages as hedges and diversifiers, but they do so in different ways. Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier stems from its unique value proposition. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its demand is influenced by adoption trends, investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors. In the days following the November election, Bitcoin surged above $100,000, with its market cap topping $2 trillion—just under 2% of the total value of global equities. Bitcoin's market cap approaches 2% of global equities Last Thursday, Bitcoin tumbled 3.6%, falling back below $100,000, on the news that the Federal Reserve will approve fewer interest rate cuts than the market expected next year. BlackRock isn’t suggesting that Bitcoin should replace bonds in your portfolio. Instead, they’re recommending a modest allocation—1% to 2%—to capture its diversification benefits without significantly increasing risk. In fact, a 2% Bitcoin allocation provides a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla) in a balanced portfolio. Even though Bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below $2 trillion, it remains the seventh-largest asset in the world, ahead of Saudi Aramco and even silver. The global gold market, by comparison, is valued at $17.8 trillion—nine times larger than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s growth trajectory is undeniable. Before its price declined, it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. That’s roughly double what it was at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin doubled its value relative to gold in 2024 Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could match and even surpass gold’s $17 trillion market cap within the next five to eight years. That’s a bold prediction, but it’s not without merit. As more investors, institutions and nations adopt Bitcoin, its scarcity becomes more pronounced, potentially driving prices higher. While Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, Dogecoin has carved out a niche as a lighthearted, community-driven cryptocurrency with surprising staying power. Originally launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has since grown into a legitimate digital asset with a market cap in the tens of billions. Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its utility for microtransactions. It’s used mostly to tip content creators and foster online engagement. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an ideal currency for small, everyday payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has no hard cap, which helps keep its price stable for transactional use. Elon Musk’s longtime support of Dogecoin has contributed to its growing popularity. News that President-elect Trump plans to appoint Musk to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added to the speculation and excitement. Since the election, Dogecoin has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin since the U.S. election While it’s still seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin’s growing user base and real-world utility suggest that it might deserve a closer look from investors. There’s even talk of a Dogecoin ETF next year. BlackRock’s research makes a compelling case for a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. I believe this relatively small position can provide meaningful diversification benefits without exposing your portfolio to excessive risk. And as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, that modest allocation could deliver outsized returns. Remember, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. But so was gold during the 1970s when it was reintroduced to the free market after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. I’ve been in this game for decades, and what I know is that over time, volatility tends to decline as an asset becomes more widely adopted. Gold will always have a place in my portfolio as the ultimate store of value. But it’s also important to stay open to new opportunities. Bitcoin represents a new frontier in wealth preservation and growth, and even the most conservative investors can no longer afford to ignore it. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence has become a dominant force in the stock market, driving the performance of top companies and capturing the attention of major investors. Insider Monkey's Q3 data reveals that 15 of the 20 companies most favored by hedge funds are deeply involved in AI, reflecting its growing influence across industries. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include tech giants leading the AI revolution, remain the most widely held by hedge funds, highlighting their central role in shaping market trends. The AI boom continues to surge, fueled by companies not just adopting but spearheading advancements in this transformative technology. As valuations for AI-driven stocks climb to unprecedented levels, the sustainability of this rally comes into question. Can the sector’s rapid growth justify its soaring price tags, or is a market correction inevitable? Investors remain on edge, closely monitoring the balance between innovation and valuation. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the “AI computing ramp” as being in its early stages, with years of growth ahead, predicting AI-driven advancements in fields like science and healthcare. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz highlighted how AI is enabling both cybercriminals and cybersecurity efforts, calling it the future “battle of AI.” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy emphasized generative AI’s role in democratizing enterprise data, noting ongoing collaborations and a robust AI product pipeline. AMD CEO Lisa Su discussed the competitive semiconductor market, stating that different computing architectures are needed for AI’s diverse applications and stressing that AI’s full impact will unfold over the years. Lastly, Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld pointed to increasing power grid pressures due to AI-related technology demands, emphasizing the growing need for backup solutions for critical facilities. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. While AI is so far looking like a force for good, it is coming with its own challenges. According to the Bloomberg report, AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse, the U.S. power grid is facing growing challenges from "bad harmonics," which occur when electrical wave patterns deviate from the ideal. These distortions can damage home appliances, increase fire risks, and signal deeper grid issues. Data shows that households near data centers experience more severe harmonics, with over half of homes with the worst distortions located within 20 miles of major data center activity. In areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers dominate, the proportion of homes experiencing high harmonic distortions exceeds the national average fourfold. Whisker Labs, using a million residential sensors, reports that 1.7% of sensors nationwide exceeded the 8% distortion threshold, a figure that jumps to 6% in areas like Prince William County, Virginia, the report states. While some utilities dispute these findings, the data highlights how data centers, combined with aging infrastructure, electrification trends, and extreme weather, are straining the grid. As the electricity demand for data centers increases, Big Tech is looking toward nuclear fuels to meet the demand. For example, Reuters reported that Amazon has signed three agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) to address the growing power demand from data centers. One project, in collaboration with X-Energy, will be based near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state and aims to generate up to 960 MW, enough to power over 770,000 homes. The company is also funding a $500 million round for X-Energy’s SMR development, targeting over 5 gigawatts of capacity by 2039. These moves come as U.S. data center power usage is set to triple by 2030. It has also partnered with Dominion Energy for an SMR project in Virginia. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:CRM) incorporates AI into its CRM platform, providing tools for predictive analytics, customized customer insights, and workflow automation. These AI-powered solutions assist businesses in streamlining processes, forecasting results, and improving customer engagement across various sectors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff promoted the company's AI agents in a Yahoo Finance interview. In another Yahoo Finance interview, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria tempered expectations about their revenue impact. He noted that Salesforce’s proposed per-transaction pricing model could worry customers, as high usage might lead to unpredictable costs. While the approach may take time for customers to adapt, Luria believes it will likely contribute only modestly to revenue next year. This comes as Salesforce is projected to approach $40 billion in revenue, making the AI agents less impactful on its overall financial performance. Overall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks on investors' radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Is NatWest Group plc (NWG) Among the U.K. Dividend Champions for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions. In recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here). A person using a laptop to access a bank's online banking system. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 4.37% NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a London-based retail and commercial bank that offers mortgages, loans, credit cards, and related services. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported an attributable profit of £1.17 billion and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 18.3%. Customer deposits, excluding central items, grew by £2.2 billion, driven by increased savings across all three business sectors. The company expects to maintain a RoTE above 15% for 2024 and projects income, excluding notable items, to reach around £14.4 billion. In addition, total income, excluding notable items, increased by £182 million (5.1%) compared to Q2 2024, primarily due to growth in lending, deposits, and margin improvement. L1 Capital also highlighted this in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG): NatWest is the largest commercial lender in the U.K. (20% share) and the second largest U.K. retail bank with ~13% of all mortgages. We see NatWest as best positioned in the U.K. Banking sector to benefit from improving margin trends, with topline growth supported by a rebound in U.K. housing and economic activity. Moreover, with significant buybacks owing to a strong capital position, NatWest should see ~8% EPS growth p.a. over the next three years vs. ~2% expected growth for CBA. Although CBA enjoys a more dominant market position in Australia vs. NatWest in the U.K., it appears overvalued in our view as it trades on ~24x FY25 P/E (historical highs) compared to only ~7x for NatWest. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is delivering solid returns in 2024, surging by nearly 83% in the past 12 months. A significant portion of the company's success in the past year is due to the unusually high interest rates, which allowed the bank to achieve exceptionally strong returns on its loans. In 2024, the bank consistently kept its net interest margin—the difference between the interest it paid and earned—above 2%. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a solid dividend payer as the company expects to pay ordinary dividends amounting to approximately 40% of its attributable profit in FY24. Currently, it pays a semi-annual dividend of $0.1543 per share for a dividend yield of 4.37%, as of December 29. As of the close of Q3 2024, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG), up from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $33.8 million. Overall NWG ranks 3rd on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NWG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NWG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(see more details here). A close-up of bottles of whisky and other alcoholic beverages from a winery. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 3.26% A British multinational alcoholic beverage company, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) ranks fourth on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The stock has dropped by nearly 13% over the past year, largely due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Diageo holds leading products in categories like scotch, gin, and vodka. Its large scale allows for substantial marketing investments, ensuring its brands remain prominent and difficult for competitors to displace. In addition, the company's size provides a strategic advantage, enabling it to acquire smaller competitors and increase their value before they become significant threats. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) reported positive FY24 earnings that were reassuring for investors. The company generated $20.3 billion in revenue, which represented a slight decrease of 1.4% compared to the previous year. The report also highlighted that Diageo either grew or maintained its market share in over 75% of its net sales across measured markets, including the US. Aristotle Capital Management, LLC made the following comment about DEO in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Headquartered in London, England, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a global leader in the alcoholic beverages industry. The company has a vast portfolio of over 200 well-recognized premium spirits (~80% of FY 2024 sales), beers (~15% and mostly Guinness) and other beverages (~5%) that are sold in nearly 180 countries. Led by its Johnnie Walker brand, Diageo is the world’s largest exporter of Scotch whiskey—its largest category at ~25% of sales—followed by other spirits such as tequila and vodka (~10% each). Diageo also owns a ~34% stake in the premium champagne and cognac maker Moët Hennessy (a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) has been gaining momentum due to its robust cash flow. In FY24, the company generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow and $2.6 billion in free cash flow, reflecting year-over-year increases of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. With this strong cash position, Diageo returned $1 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year and raised its annual dividend by 5%, bringing it to $1.0348 per share. The stock's dividend yield comes in at 3.26%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 26 funds held stakes in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared with 31 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $703 million in total. Overall DEO ranks 4th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of DEO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DEO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) the Best Dividend Growth Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks. Dividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term. Also read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In Historically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market’s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience. This resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "Ideally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can't always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that's when a stock is really interesting to me." High-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company’s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. 5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.51% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The Florida-based renewable energy company posted strong earnings recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.57 billion, a 5.6% increase from the previous year. The company had another strong quarter in renewable energy and storage development, adding about 3 gigawatts (GW) to its project backlog for the second consecutive quarter. Over the past four quarters, it has secured roughly 11 GW in new projects. Madison Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Oracle Corporation, Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. NextEra has continued to perform well given its strong position in the renewable energy space, increasing demand for power, its transmission capabilities, as well as a tailwind from lower interest rates.” In addition to its strong foundation, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has developed one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets worldwide. This segment has gained from the shift away from polluting carbon fuels towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Given the long-term nature of the power transition, the company is poised for continued growth over the coming decades. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a nearly 19% return to shareholders. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share on October 18, which fell in line with its previous dividend. In 2024, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 28 years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 10.5% in the past five years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 69 funds held stakes in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $2.47 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NEE ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While institutions own 40% of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 58% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-14-24 Performance Since Then: 31.56% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest eCommerce firm in the US and also a key player in the lucrative cloud computing industry. Its partnership with AI firm Anthropic has also allowed the company to establish a foothold for itself in the AI industry and access technologies for enterprise AI products provided through AWS. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the handful of firms that operate across all layers of the AI stack - from designing custom chips to providing end-use applications. The tail-end of November and the start of December have been great for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares as its Project Rainier supercomputer built using in-house Trainium chips will be used by Anthropic to train AI. Cramer was very optimistic about the firm in August: "We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Fortune set out to pick the leaders who’ve kept Europe at the center of global debates in 2024. Their presence portends the year to come. Why investing for the long run, especially if you buy certain popular stocks, could reap huge rewards. The technology provides blowing-filling-capping solutions for water, milk, and juice bottles in beverage applications. The S&P 500 index is set to cap off a banner year. Investing in the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is generally a smart move as the index has historically returned an annual average of 9% per year with dividends reinvested, but other funds may beat the S&P 500. One of the best-performing ETFs of the last 10 years has been the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), up roughly 800% over that time span. Investors of all types can benefit from the power of dividend stocks. Although dividends are usually sought by those in or nearing retirement, those regular payouts can contribute mightily to your long-term returns wherever you are in your investing journey. In those times, recurring dividend payments can cushion a portfolio's returns and give an investor cash to reinvest while stocks are trading at lower levels. With the broader stock market indexes hovering around all-time highs, some investors may fear that a sell-off is creeping on the horizon in 2025. After all, equity prices have outpaced earnings growth, leading to a relatively expensive market. Investment management firm Vanguard offers several low-cost ETFs that target various themes and stock market sectors. Futures fall: The S&P 500 is set to undercut a key level after Friday's sell-off. Nvidia has a new buy point. Tesla deliveries loom. Apple is close to becoming the first company ever to reach $4 trillion in market value. Monitor these key chart levels. AMD shares are one of the few big-tech names riding a big decline into the final trading days of the year. Investors remain concerned that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates as aggressively as hoped in 2025. Lower rates help boost economic growth—and make buying new cars more affordable. Aside from the market move, there haven’t been any new analyst reports or price target changes to pin Tesla’s move on. Sign in to access your portfolio

Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 16.25% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The firm has managed to position itself as one of the most important AI stocks in the industry after suffering devastating market performance in 2022 because of Mark Zuckerberg's focus on the metaverse. Now, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has shaped up as an important AI player because of its 3 billion+ user base which investors believe can be used to monetize AI and push services to consumers. The firm is already allowing advertisers to use AI tools to run campaigns, and its narrative depends on sustained AI monetization. Another major catalyst for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stock in H2 2024 has been a potential TikTok ban that could further grow its user base. Cramer was full of praise for the firm's AI division in August: "We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd! Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?" Overall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Has Been Telling You Can Get 4x Your Money If You Buy His Chips’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 25.75% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is the only company in the world with a sizable presence in the x86 CPU and GPU markets. In both of these markets, the firm is the second biggest player. Its presence in the CPU industry has helped Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) eke out market share following chip giant Intel's historic struggles with manufacturing the latest chips. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s acquisitions over the past couple of years have provided it with a footing in tertiary industries such as FPGAs and AI products. While its AI accelerators are also somewhat popular, sentiment has soured in the year's second half. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares are down by 9.6% year-to-date; but, Cramer was optimistic in August: "AMD isn't nipping at their heels. AMD is dominating.

The firm's assisted driving platform FSD is among the market leaders in its niche, and it uses AI and copious computing resources to derive real-time driving insights.

Title: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset-cryptoquant-ceo-questions-uss-next-move/

Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency.

He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Luxury Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) stands against other luxury stocks according to hedge funds. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the luxury goods market has a size of $103.10 billion as of 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.07% and reach $145.08 billion by 2029. Similarly, a study by Global Market Insights published on Yahoo! Finance shows that the luxury packaging market was valued at $17.2 billion in 2023. It is also anticipated to grow and reach $25.8 billion by the end of 2032. North America’s demand for luxury products is significantly high, primarily due to the region’s high disposable incomes. This is especially significant in the ongoing holiday shopping season in the US. On December 17, Simeon Siegel, BMO Capital Markets senior analyst for retail and e-commerce, appeared on CNBC to discuss the state of the consumer in the current holiday shopping season. He said that the US consumer is overly resilient. In the current scenario, the market is seeing winners grow and laggers fall behind, which is how it should be. This trend goes opposite to market dynamics in COVID-19 when every company grew. Siegel was further of the view that the consumers are still spending. For better and for worse, consumers are scared of not having something under the Christmas tree this year. On December 10, CNBC’s Steve Liesman appeared on ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the CNBC NRF Retail Monitor. Numbers from the Monitor corroborated Siegel’s claim and showed healthy consumer spending in November despite a shorter holiday shopping season in 2024. Non-store retailers showed a 21.5% year-over-year growth, reflecting these positive trends. Since this holiday shopping season came with lower gas prices and a deflation in the prices of goods overall, consumers had more discretionary dollars in their pockets and paid somewhat less compared to a year ago. Since luxury items fall in the category of discretionary items, these trends show positive stimulus for the industry. We discussed consumer behavior in the ongoing holiday shopping season in a recently published article on the 7 best department store stocks to buy now. Here is an excerpt from the article: “The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren’t all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn’t so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. On December 2, Mastercard Economics Institute chief economist Michelle Meyer appeared on CNBC to discuss industry trends and said that consumers have been geared to find value and best deals. She said that the Black Friday numbers show that consumers have been monitoring the market and gearing up to spend on the Black Friday weekend. With inflation cooling and promotions returning, consumers are focused on finding the best deals in the market that offer value at a discount. This was one of the major motivating factors that drove considerably strong spending in e-commerce during the Black Friday weekend. Apparel, jewelry, and electronics remain the top gift sectors for the holidays, but consumers are prioritizing promotions with the greatest value instead of going ahead with brand loyalty. Meyer was of the view that consumers have the ability and the willingness to spend; they are just being savvy with their expenses by spending when promotions and deals come in. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 luxury stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) operates Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and Harley-Davidson Financial Services. HDMC manufactures and designs luxury Harley-Davidson motorcycles, motorcycle parts, apparel, and accessories. It operates globally, with operations in the EMEA region, Asia, the United States, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. The company experienced a challenging global market environment in fiscal Q3 2024 due to macroeconomic and political uncertainty and the pressure of high interest rates affecting its industry and customers. As a result, its global retail sales of new motorcycles dropped by 13% in fiscal Q3 2024. North America saw a 10% decline, compared to 18% across international regions. Overall, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) is seeing greater spending from higher-income customers. Its motorcycle mix corroborates this, with CVO motorcycles up double-digital percentages throughout 2024. The company’s touring segment in the United States was up by around 10% through the end of fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was driven by its new touring lineup. It gained more than four percentage points of market share, outperforming the category, its other segments, and the market as a whole. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) ranks 12th on our list of the top 12 luxury stocks according to hedge funds. Artisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The biggest detractors from performance during the quarter were Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG), Henry Schein and Expedia. Harley’s share price declined 23% during the quarter after a strong run in Q1. We had significantly reduced our position at higher share prices over the past 12–18 months. The shares have been weak over concerns that higher interest rates are impacting affordability and retail sales. We share these concerns. Harley is likely to reduce its forecasts for the year when it reports, though this now appears to be discounted in the valuation. Famous last words. The shares now trade at a single-digit multiple of earnings. We believe the brand is strong, and management is able to adjust production and costs to meet various demand environments. If interest rates begin to decline as anticipated, demand should improve.” Overall, HOG ranks 12th on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of luxury stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Shareholders of United Airlines-backed electric plane maker Archer Aviation agreed to double the amount of common stock available on the market.

Google stock has gained 37% in 2024 as investors mull the future of its internet search business and the outlook for DoJ antitrust cases during the Trump administration. Bitcoin price made history in 2024, and if a recent report is to be believed, the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $150,000 in the first half of 2025 and potentially hit $185,000 by the fourth quarter. Broadcom and Super Micro Computer in the Box have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Palantir was a big winner in 2024, but 2025 might see these two dramatically outperform.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) designs, markets, and distributes luxury athletic footwear, accessories, equipment, and services for sports and fitness activities. Its operating segments span EMEA, Greater China, APLA, and North America. The company also designs products specifically for the Converse and Jordan brands. Several of its products are valued at thousands of dollars. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is considered one of the top luxury fashion brands, and has a market cap of $113.75 billion. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported a decline of 8% in its revenues on a reported basis and a 9% decline on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal Q2 2025. This decline was primarily due to the ongoing headwinds from the company’s franchise management actions. It is shifting its product portfolio by reducing the proportion of its business driven by its classic footwear franchises, including Air Jordan 1, Air Force 1, and Dunk. This caused a reduction in revenues from these franchises as the company continued to tighten its marketplace supply. These franchises decelerated faster than the company’s business in fiscal Q2 2025, at a rate greater than fiscal Q1 2025. The company is actively rebalancing product allocations to its highest traffic channel to maximize full-price realization and franchise health. The company is driving the biggest reductions to its classic footwear franchises on NIKE Direct, which fell 14% with NIKE Digital declining 21% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. However, the company also saw momentum build with positive physical and digital traffic. Black Friday week proved to be the largest demand week ever on NIKE Digital with sales increasing by double-digits. Similarly, 11/11 sales exceeded company plans in Greater China. Fiscal Q2 2025 thus reflected progress in key areas, with the company gaining consumer support. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Other moves during the quarter included sales of United Parcel Service (UPS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Nike has become overly reliant on key platforms, like Jordan, for revenue growth while innovation in areas like running has lagged. Nike could face continued revenue and profit pressure as it invests to re-invigorate innovation and re-position the business back toward wholesale outlets. As such, we are seeking out better ways to participate in the global consumer recovery in companies where earnings estimates have already reset.” Overall, NKE ranks first on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of luxury stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NKE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is First Solar (FSLR) Among the Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-solar-fslr-among-best-204440037.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump’s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector. READ ALSO: 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase “drill, baby, drill” might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration’s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government. However, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels makes it increasingly dominant in the global energy mix. A solar panel farm with an orange sky illuminating the vast landscape. To compile our list of the 11 best renewable energy stocks to buy now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 11 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 59 First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar modules, primarily designed for utility-scale solar projects. The company’s advanced photovoltaic technology offers high energy efficiency and exceptional durability. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) generates revenue through the sale of solar modules, the development of solar power plants, and the provision of operations and maintenance services. Its customer base includes utility-scale project developers, power plant owners, and government organizations. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is taking proactive steps to protect its intellectual property and differentiate itself in a highly competitive market. The company possesses a robust TOPCon patent portfolio, which it has begun to leverage through outreach to various solar manufacturers, notifying them of potential infringement issues and reserving its rights. By securing and enforcing its intellectual property rights, First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) aims to safeguard its competitive advantage and ensure that its unique value proposition is recognized and respected by all market participants. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is also focusing on expanding its technological capabilities and manufacturing capacity to achieve its goal of surpassing 14 gigawatts of annual U.S. capacity and over 25 gigawatts of global capacity by 2026. The company is advancing its perovskite technology through a new development line in Perrysburg, Ohio. This initiative aims to replicate in-line manufacturing conditions and expedite the commercialization of this innovative technology. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) recently opened its $1.1 billion Alabama facility, which will contribute an additional 3.5 gigawatts of vertically integrated solar manufacturing capacity once fully operational. Furthermore, the company remains on schedule to launch operations at its Louisiana facility in the second half of 2025. Overall, FSLR ranks 4th on our list of best renewable energy stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of FSLR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FSLR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Sabre Corporation (SABR) the Best Low Priced Technology Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) stands against the other undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that not only maintains regular dividend payments to shareholders but also increases its payouts annually. To qualify as a dividend aristocrat, a company must raise its dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years. Michael Clarfeld, Portfolio Manager at ClearBridge, recently talked about why companies that consistently grow their dividends are well-positioned to handle the challenges of 2025. With rising costs, tighter margins, higher interest rates, and inflation on the horizon, Clarfeld is still optimistic about the economy. He pointed to strong employment numbers, upbeat consumer sentiment, and confident businesses, especially after the election. Pro-business policies under the Trump administration could drive investments and growth, which sounds great, but there’s a catch. For instance, bringing manufacturing back to the US would create jobs and boost wages, but it could also increase business costs. After two strong years, Clarfeld doesn’t see much room for big capital gains in 2025. Plus, with inflation sticking around, the Federal Reserve is likely to take a more cautious approach. That said, he sees opportunities in sectors like European and global consumer staples and US energy infrastructure. Clarfeld is a big fan of dividend growth stocks, calling them a timeless investment. They can act as a safety net during volatile markets and provide steady income, which is especially useful when capital appreciation feels out of reach. He also highlighted how dividends help protect your purchasing power by keeping up with inflation. In his view, dividend growth is a smart and reliable strategy for navigating a potentially bumpy 2025. Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors sees dividend investing as a smart move, expecting the Fed to ease rates. According to Baiocchi, investors are shifting from money markets and fixed income to dividend-paying stocks, especially companies with leverage that could benefit from lower interest rates. Similarly, Mike Akins of ETF Action also sees dividend ETFs as a defensive play, highlighting that the companies included typically have strong balance sheets. He notes the growing popularity of dividend-focused ETFs, suggesting that consistent dividends give investors confidence in a company’s stability and financial health. Both experts agree that dividends offer a sense of durability and drawdown protection in uncertain markets. A wheat field at sunset, showing the company's commitment to agricultural commodities. In this article, we selected stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats List that had a P/E ratio below 20 as of December 23. Our focus was on identifying stocks with the strongest hedge fund sentiment in Q3 2024 among the 66 Dividend Aristocrats that also met our P/E criteria. The stocks are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders for each company. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Dividend Yield as of December 23: 3.79% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 P/E Ratio: 14.18 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a global leader in the procurement, transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural commodities, with operations in several countries, including the US, Switzerland, Brazil, and the UK. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) handles agricultural raw materials like oilseeds, offers a wide range of food and animal feed products, and produces ingredients for different industries, such as food, energy, and chemicals. It also provides specialized products like proteins, natural flavors, and pet food. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) reported a challenging third quarter in 2024, with net earnings of $18 million and adjusted net earnings of $530 million. Earnings per share were $0.04, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.09, both down from the previous year. A non-cash charge of $461 million related to its Wilmar equity investment impacted GAAP earnings. The company also experienced an 8% drop in revenue, totaling $20 billion for the quarter, missing analyst estimates by $1.57 billion. Despite these setbacks, ADM's cash flow remained strong, with operating cash flow reaching $2.5 billion year-to-date, up from $1.9 billion the previous year. ADM also remains committed to its long-standing tradition of dividend growth, with 51 consecutive years of increases and a current quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. As per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 35 funds in the last quarter. Overall, ADM ranks 5th on our list of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ADM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI data centers are making your electricity supply worse and could damage your home, new study says

Data centers in the United States are consuming so much power that they may be impacting the flow of electricity to millions of Americans. AI data centers are sprouting up across the country to meet the increased demand for AI, but they're also sucking up the power on which millions of Americans rely. The new tech is demanding massive amounts of energy from grids that are, in some areas, already stressed. Researchers have estimated that AI centers could need three to five times the power used by traditional facilities, Business Insider previously reported. A Bloomberg analysis assessed readings from some 770,000 homes from February to October and found that over 75% of "highly distorted power readings across the country are within 50 miles of significant data center activity." Stresses on the power grid can lead to inconsistent power quality, and as the power quality decreases, the risk increases, Bloomberg reported. Inconsistent energy flow can cause electronics to overheat, leading to sparks or even house fires. A small handful of large tech companies own the vast majority of global data centers — and they show no signs of slowing down as they pour billions into building more powerful AI models. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft own about 65% of the cloud infrastructure market, which includes data centers, according to a 2023 report from market research firm Synergy Research Group. Google announced in April that it's investing $3 billion to build and expand data centers in Virginia and Indiana. The search engine giant unveiled its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0, in December. Amazon, which is a large investor in AI startup Anthropic, is investing another $10 billion in Ohio data centers, Gov. Mike DeWine announced on December 16. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said in September that the company has partnered with other investors, including BlackRock, in a $100 billion energy infrastructure project. The project will include "new and expanded data centers," the company said. To meet AI's increasing energy demands, companies like Google have also started turning to nuclear power to find more reliable and sustainable energy sources. Jump to

Title: Jim Cramer on Intel Corporation (INTC): ‘Better Than Ever. Don’t Worry About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: -0.83% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer. While its business model of designing and manufacturing chips provides it with a clear advantage in the industry, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has struggled in 2024. The firm's AI chips have failed to compete with NVIDIA's offerings, and sluggishness in the personal computing market has hit its revenues right when it's investing in retaking the chip manufacturing process technology lead from Taiwan's TSMC. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s shares are down 57.5% year-to-date, and it's exiting 2024 with more turmoil in the form of former CEO Patrick Gelsinger's surprising exit. Cramer started out his comments about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with sarcasm and then pointed out its troubles: "Intel's fine. Better than ever. Don't worry about it. I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. DREAM ON! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut his dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner." Overall INTC ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an electrical infrastructure company whose products are used in data centers that compute AI workloads. It's one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 due to strong revenue growth stemming from tailwinds in the data center and utilities markets. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s revenue grew by 45% during its fiscal year 2024, and the shares are up by 156% year-to-date. One key factor that has driven investor optimism in the firm's stock is its backlog. A robust backlog lets investors gain visibility into future orders. As of its fiscal Q4, Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s backlog remained steady at $1.4 billion. Cramer commented on the backlog and other factors surrounding the firm: "Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn't accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes?

Title: 2024: The Extraordinary Year When Bitcoin Went Mainstream

A view of the New Year's Eve '2024' Numerals, to be lit up at midnight on December 31, in New York's ... [+] world-famous Times Square in United States on December 20, 2023. (Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty Images) History will remember 2024 as the year bitcoin transformed from a niche investment to a mainstream asset. With its dollar exchange rate breaking the symbolic $100,000 mark, and the largest financial firms in the world embracing a bitcoin strategy, the orange coin can no longer be dismissed. You can still think whatever you want about bitcoin, you just can’t ignore it. The new year promises many exciting possibilities such as adoption at the highest levels of government, expansion of bitcoin’s use as an institutional treasury asset, an overhaul of regulation to make the U.S. more friendly to financial innovation, and geopolitical dynamics that propel bitcoin into a new era. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs – a moment that will likely be viewed as a watershed in financial history. For years, the SEC resisted bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation and investor protections. The approval marked a decisive shift in the agency’s stance, sending billions of dollars in liquidity into the market and boosting confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their launch was the most successful in the history of ETFs and now hold more assets under management than gold ETFs. BlackRock iShares ETF AUM: Gold vs. Bitcoin. (CryptoQuant) These ETFs have provided an open door for new sources of liquidity to enter into the bitcoin markets, since certain pools of capital cannot be converted to physical bitcoin, but can purchase regulated financial products like ETFs. Perhaps even more crucially, bitcoin ETFs have normalized bitcoin as an investment. Pension funds, retirement accounts, and institutional portfolios – and the financial advisors that manage them – now have a way to achieve bitcoin exposure with the same ease as stocks, bonds, and other instruments. Institutional adoption of bitcoin reached unprecedented levels in 2024. BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank, gained SEC approval to offer bitcoin custody services, a move signaling that even the most conservative institutions now recognize bitcoin’s staying power. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, received approval for the iShares Bitcoin Trust to offer spot bitcoin ETF options. This paved the way for more efficient price discovery, which may dampen price volatility in 2025. Although volatility is not inherently bad, it does prevent certain types of investors from entering the market. A meaningful reduction in volatility may lead in turn to higher confidence in the asset, leading to yet more inflows, and thus more price discovery, further dampened volatility, and so on, establishing a virtuous cycle of adoption and appreciation of bitcoin as an asset class. Bitcoin’s mainstream moment was also catalyzed by visionary corporate leaders. MicroStrategy, already renowned as a bitcoin pioneer, announced an audacious plan to raise $42 billion over three years to expand its bitcoin holdings. Since that announcement, the company has already filed additional paperwork with the SEC to issue yet more shares, to buy yet more bitcoin. Microstrategy’s treasury operations are a fascinating financial innovation that will be studied for years to come. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s leadership, a handful of other companies followed suit in 2024, including Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, and others. In fact, in just the past few days, new filings with the SEC reveal several new bitcoin ETFs on the horizon: There’s no other way to say it – in one of the most contentious presidential elections in U.S. history, Americans elected a pro-bitcoin president in a landslide. On his path to retake the White House, Donald Trump spoke openly of his support for bitcoin, and even delivered a historic keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. Key Trump administration members have vocalized support for bitcoin, including RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Don Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and others. At the same time, congress is getting into the game, with U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis championing a proposal to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). An SBR would position the United States as a global leader in sound money, leveraging bitcoin as both a hedge and an asset of geopolitical significance – and could even help restore separation of powers within the federal government. With the incoming administration facing significant economic challenges, it is a good thing that bitcoin is rightly viewed as a tool for meeting them. As we approach the end of 2024, bitcoin’s market capitalization has surpassed silver and even Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s most valuable companies. With the momentary passing of the $100,000 price milestone, questions naturally arise about what the price will be a year from now. The events of 2024 suggest that the momentum is far from over. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, regulators are becoming more bitcoin-friendly, and public interest is growing. With these tailwinds, 2025 may well see continued price appreciation. Numbers like $250,000 and $475,000 are often shared. Chamath Palihapitiya has modeled a price for bitcoin of $500,000 to $1.14 million over the course of the current halving epoch, which ends in 2028. With so many variables affecting the price, it’s hard to set any solid expectations. Luckily, we don’t have to – bitcoin is an asset that is best used to build generational wealth slowly and steadily over the long term. Bitcoin’s CAGR is about 25% to 40% over a five year period. This means that price action, even over the course of two or three years, should be considered short-term. The best way to build wealth with bitcoin is to put aside money you do not need to access for at least five years, and set up a savings strategy that’s customized to your needs. The extraordinary events of 2024 have made one thing abundantly clear: bitcoin is a household name that’s here to stay. Its monetary properties offer a resilience and reliability that no other asset can. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Jim Cramer on Visa Inc. (V): ‘I’m Waiting For Visa To Come Down At A Discount’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Financial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. Before and after the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier this month, Jim Cramer had plenty to say on the subject matter. Ahead of the Fed's announcement, the CNBC host wondered why investors were reading too much into the Fed's interest rate cut decisions. In an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer stated that it wasn't clear to him why "people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." Another pressing issue that's caught his attention is the incoming Trump Administration's proposed tariffs against China and other US trading partners. He linked tariffs with interest rate cuts and the consumer price index (CPI) or inflation. One of the biggest concerns among analysts and economists, when it comes to tariffs, is the extent to which they might influence prices. Cramer believes that the Fed might not cut interest rates if the tariffs cause prices to rise. On the flip side, he added that if there aren't any tariffs or if the incoming administration is selective about them, then the housing market might pick up again and auto sales could rise. Additionally, Cramer also speculated that even if the tariffs did cause inflation, "a year we’ll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that’s over." As a result, he believes that investors should focus more on the Trump administration's policies instead of the Fed. "Why do we have to focus so much on what’s going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?” he asked. The need to focus on the Fed did become clear soon after Cramer's comments. In a highly watched mid-December decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that while his organization was cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, it might cut rates just twice in 2025 as opposed to the earlier guidance of four cuts. On the day Chair Powell updated investors about the bank's outlook, the flagship S&P, the Dow, and the broader NASDAQ stock indexes lost 2.95%, 2.58%, and 3.56%, respectively. Cramer, unsurprisingly, wasn't short on words when it came to dissecting the Fed's decision. Speaking on Mad Money on the day of the rate cut, he shared that Powell was caught off guard by having to fulfill market expectations of an interest rate cut that might not be justified given the strength of the US economy. According to Cramer, when it came to the rate cut the "data didn’t back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” The next day, he shared that it would have been better if the Fed hadn't "set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut." Yet, even though Cramer believes that America's economic strength did not warrant an interest rate cut, he isn't convinced that the economy is strong all over. On Squawk on the Street ahead of the interest rate cut, Cramer wondered where the Atlanta Fed had gotten its 3.2% US GDP growth estimate for Q4. “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong,” he outlined and added that he's "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where" the GDP is growing by 3.2%. Cramer speculated "travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Cramer's comments about the economy and the Fed's future actions are particularly important when we talk about financial services stocks. These firms typically do well when consumer spending isn't constrained by inflation and interest rates are low to facilitate business lending, deal-making, and other activities.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 165 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 10-07-24/10-08-24 Performance Since Then: 14.8% Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the largest credit card processor in the US as it commands 61% of the US market by purchase volume. As a result, the stock is dependent on consumer spending strength and low rates to drive higher transaction volumes. Higher spending led Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to beat analyst revenue estimates of $9.49 billion in Q3 by posting $9.62 billion. Its shares soared by 2.9% after the earnings and then gained another 4.8% after President-elect Trump's victory in the November election. Over the long term, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) might have to pick up the pace with its global expansion efforts to counter the threat of fintech upstarts eating away its market share. The firm is also being sued by the Justice Department for alleged monopolistic practices and is on the backfoot when it comes to a $30 billion settlement with merchants. Here's what Cramer said in October: “… Look, it sells at 27 times earnings. I’m waiting for Visa to come down at a discount. You don’t have that. Right now, I have to tell you, Mastercard is actually doing a little better than Visa. But no, no need to add a position on that. That’s not the right basis. Just keep looking. It’s a great long-term stock and I think it always will be as long as this is well run as it is now.” Overall V ranks 1st on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Financial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. Before and after the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier this month, Jim Cramer had plenty to say on the subject matter. Ahead of the Fed's announcement, the CNBC host wondered why investors were reading too much into the Fed's interest rate cut decisions. In an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer stated that it wasn't clear to him why "people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." Another pressing issue that's caught his attention is the incoming Trump Administration's proposed tariffs against China and other US trading partners. He linked tariffs with interest rate cuts and the consumer price index (CPI) or inflation. One of the biggest concerns among analysts and economists, when it comes to tariffs, is the extent to which they might influence prices. Cramer believes that the Fed might not cut interest rates if the tariffs cause prices to rise. On the flip side, he added that if there aren't any tariffs or if the incoming administration is selective about them, then the housing market might pick up again and auto sales could rise. Additionally, Cramer also speculated that even if the tariffs did cause inflation, "a year we’ll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that’s over." As a result, he believes that investors should focus more on the Trump administration's policies instead of the Fed.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 120 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-05-24 Performance Since Then: 1.81% Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is Warren Buffett's investment holding company with stakes in a variety of businesses. The firm's largest business is its insurance division closely followed by its utility and energy operations. Despite the well-diversified business model with stakes in railroad, construction, and energy, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) nevertheless depends on robust economic performance for its share price gains. Therefore, it was unsurprising that the stock fell by 2% after the Fed's interest rate decisions and soared by 5.4% after the November election. Here's what Cramer said in September: "When is it a bad time to buy Berkshire? Buy some tomorrow. I think it’s terrific. Then, wait until it comes down and buy some more." Overall BRK-B ranks 2nd on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: The Glaring Hypocrisy and Embedded Deceptions of the Global Food Giants
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/deceptions-global-food-giants/5875934
Time Published: 2024-12-29T18:19:41Z
Full Content:
Bryce Martinez (18) from Pennsylvania is mounting a legal challenge against major food companies, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. The 11 firms listed in the lawsuit are Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, Post Holdings, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle’s (US), WK Kellogg, Mars, Kellanova and Conagra. UPFs have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives and artificial ingredients. These UPFs have become staples in many households. Examples of UPFs are prepackaged soups, many breakfast cereals, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals, hot dogs, sausages, sodas, ice cream and store-bought cookies, cakes, candies and doughnuts. Martinez’s legal team contends that the big food corporations have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses. His lawyers at Morgan & Morgan, a major US law firm, says the case is unprecedented and includes claims for conspiracy, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair business practices. Martinez had regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood. The lawsuit challenges the food industry’s argument that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. It argues that the notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics, especially aimed at children, and the addictive nature of these products. UPFs are highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where investment firms profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases associated with these products. Furthermore, the prevailing economic system creates a paradoxical situation where workers, whose pension funds are often managed by these same investment giants, find themselves financially tethered to a cycle that undermines their own health and well-being. There is a famous quote often attributed to farmer, poet and campaigner Wendell Berry: “People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food.” For a long time, that has served both industry’s interests very well. The influence that giant corporations have on the food system is encapsulated by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Presenting itself as an independent scientific organisation, across the world, from China to India, the ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders. According to the report Partnership for an Unhealthy Planet (Corporate Accountability, 2020), political interference by food and beverage transnationals like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo is pervasive. The report shows how these corporations have leveraged the ILSI to cripple progress on nutrition policy across the globe. After documenting that the ILSI has spun a complex web of revolving doors or partnering with leading research institutions in India (including “controlling” the Niti Aayog, the Government of India’s policy think tank) to denigrate traditional diets, the report states: “ILSI India is emblematic of how ILSI at large ensures that the food and beverage industry are able to deepen their capture of public policy and discourse thereabouts across the globe. One such example of this is an ILSI-sponsored study on sugar consumption by two of India’s most respected research entities, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Nutrition.” It adds: “… the study’s intent seems to be the absolution of food products marketed by ILSI’s corporate backers and/or redirection of public dietary concerns toward the traditional foods ILSI’s funders would hope to supplant.” The ILSI generates scientific data and provides it to state agencies, working to harmonise food regulations and facilitate international trade, not least by shaping Codex standards and guidelines. It has a notable influence on Codex through its collaborations with regulatory bodies involved in setting food safety standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an international organisation jointly run by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its published goals are to develop and adopt uniform food standards for its member countries and to promote the free and unhindered international flow of food goods, thereby eliminating trade barriers to food and (supposedly) providing food safety. Biotechnology, pesticides, food additives and contaminants are some of the issues discussed in Codex meetings. The FAO says: “Codex standards are based on the best available science assisted by independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO.” Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. It decides on minimum food residue levels for pesticides, allowable amounts of aluminium, lead and arsenic in food and which substances or products are dangerous. These decisions affect the products and markets of huge corporations that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. The ILSI has infiltrated key national and international food and health regulatory and decision-making bodies in an attempt to lobby away or discredit any potential decision that may affect their bottom line (see The opaque world of Codex Alimentarius and Monsanto ‘toxic’ relations). According to Ivica Kelam of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek in Croatia: “The ILSI enjoys close relationships with regulatory bodies including the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives and the European Food Safety Authority, which rely on the substantial resources controlled by the ILSI. The organisation not only influences Codex standards through direct cooperation with national and international regulators but also indirectly through the networks it develops.” Funders of the ILSI have included at some point Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Mars, Mondelez, General Mills, Nestle, Kellogg, Hershey, Kraft, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Starbucks Coffee, Monsanto, CropLife International, Syngenta, Dow AgroSciences, Pioneer Hi-Bred, Bayer CropScience, BASF, Cargill, Unilever and Campbell Soup (see the reports Pushing partnerships: corporate influence on research and policy via the International Life Sciences Institute and ILSI is a food industry lobby group). Bryce Martinez is up against some very powerful forces that will do everything they possibly can to stave off any challenge that could potentially represent a critical threat to their power, profits and practices. In late 2020, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI) released a report that described how Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo used the COVID event to aggressively market UPFs. In Brazil, Nestlé, Bauducco and Danone donated more than 400 tons of food, including UFPs deemed unhealthy according to official Brazilian dietary guidelines. In South Africa, Coca-Cola donated soft drinks to families in townships and multiple healthcare centres. The GHAI notes that big food corporations also touted their unhealthy UPFs as essential, safe products and immune boosters. In Brazil, The ILSI cynically promoted processed foods as allies in the fight against COVID. In Japan, Coca-Cola encouraged people to exercise at home while ‘in quarantine’ through online exercise videos, pledging to donate up to one million drinks to app users who tracked 1,000 steps a day. In Brazil, McDonalds posted videos on X showing kids pressuring their parents to go to McDonalds during ‘quarantine’ to safely pick up food through the contactless drive thru. The report highlighted how the lack of healthy food regulations worldwide enabled these corporations to polish their public images while undermining public health. The reality is that research indicates diets high in UPFs may undermine immunity through several mechanisms, primarily related to nutrient deficiencies, inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiome. The GHAI says that the very companies who had already contributed to rising rates of obesity and diet-related diseases exploited the COVID event to position themselves and their products as “essential” while also, directly and indirectly, influencing public health policy. A peer-reviewed study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) was associated with more than 10 per cent of all-cause premature, preventable deaths in Brazil in 2019. UPFs have steadily replaced the consumption of traditional whole foods, such as rice and beans, in Brazil (see also the report Free trade and Mexico’s junk food epidemic). In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, a much higher figure than that for Brazil. And it is the poorer sections of society that rely more on UPF items because of their low cost. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. Studies have associated UPFs with significant increased risks of cardiovascular disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and abnormal blood lipid levels, anxiety and mental disorders, depression and cognitive decline and impairment. There is also increased risk of certain cancers, particularly ovarian and breast cancers. (See this, this, this and this.) The GHAI report described how the very corporations that have driven the spiralling public health crisis to alarming levels were using an event framed as a public health emergency to their advantage. Their cynicism and hypocrisy are impossible to ignore. What was once nature’s gift (wholesome food) has been transformed to become an industrial commodity. As UPS have come to increasingly dominate diets and wreak havoc on human health, profit margins are boosted and consumers are regarded as mere collateral damage to be rinsed for further profit by the ‘healthcare’ industry.

On the day Chair Powell updated investors about the bank's outlook, the flagship S&P, the Dow, and the broader NASDAQ stock indexes lost 2.95%, 2.58%, and 3.56%, respectively.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 50 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-06-24 Performance Since Then: 26.90% Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is a global asset management giant with $43 billion in assets and $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter. Like other asset managers, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) benefits from lower rates as they increase merger and deal-making activities and also increase liquidity in markets. The tailwinds from a lower interest rate regime are also evident in the firm's stock which is up 35.7% year-to-date. Specifically, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)'s shares soared by 7.9% in October after the firm's $1.01 billion in earnings per share beat analyst estimates of $0.92. The beat came on the back of heightened capital markets activity, and it followed Cramer's mixed optimism during the previous month: "Near term, I don’t have a lot of conviction. Blackstone has had a very big run, from the 120s to the 130s. Longer term, I think Jonathan Gray and his team are simply brilliant, and their actions this week in the data center are very strong. I like it.” Overall BX ranks 7th on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of BX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Speaking on Mad Money on the day of the rate cut, he shared that Powell was caught off guard by having to fulfill market expectations of an interest rate cut that might not be justified given the strength of the US economy. According to Cramer, when it came to the rate cut the "data didn’t back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” The next day, he shared that it would have been better if the Fed hadn't "set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut." Yet, even though Cramer believes that America's economic strength did not warrant an interest rate cut, he isn't convinced that the economy is strong all over. On Squawk on the Street ahead of the interest rate cut, Cramer wondered where the Atlanta Fed had gotten its 3.2% US GDP growth estimate for Q4. “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong,” he outlined and added that he's "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where" the GDP is growing by 3.2%. Cramer speculated "travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Cramer's comments about the economy and the Fed's future actions are particularly important when we talk about financial services stocks. These firms typically do well when consumer spending isn't constrained by inflation and interest rates are low to facilitate business lending, deal-making, and other activities.

Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about financial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out financial stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A professional asset manager making an investment decision at their office. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 10-04-24 Performance Since Then: 10% BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) is one of the largest and most diversified asset management companies in the world. The firm manages mutual funds and investment portfolios, and it is also a key player in the private equity market. Strong stock market performance in 2024 coupled with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s bitcoin exchange-traded funds that became operational at the start of the year have helped the firm as its shares are up by 30.5% year-to-date while its assets under management have boomed to $10.7 trillion as of the second quarter and $11.5 trillion as of the third quarter. Since Cramer's remarks in October, the stock hasn't stopped rising, and the only major dip took place in December when the shares lost 3% in the days following the Federal Reserve's updated interest rate outlook. Here's what Cramer said: “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” Overall BLK ranks 9th on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) stands against the other German dividend stocks. Europe's economy might see some positive developments in 2025, but risks still loom. Strong U.S. growth could boost demand for EU exports while easing inflation in Europe may lead the ECB to cut interest rates, spurring investment and economic growth. A potential increase in U.S. fossil fuel production could lower global oil prices, benefiting oil-importing countries like those in the EU. Additionally, US tax cuts might strengthen the dollar, making European goods more competitive globally. However, the EU's growth prospects hinge on geopolitical stability. Escalations in conflicts like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East, or a possible China-Taiwan crisis could derail this cautiously optimistic outlook. Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs Research is optimistic about European stocks in 2025, expecting the European index to deliver around a 9% total return, despite challenges like political uncertainty and slow economic growth. In a recent discussion with Sharon Bell, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, she explained that while they've slightly lowered their forecasts for the index, European stocks could still benefit from cooling inflation and a robust policy response. The team downgraded their targets due to weaker economic data and rising risks in countries like France and Italy. However, they believe the situation isn't as dire as past crises. They see potential in sectors like telecoms and real estate, which may thrive as interest rates are expected to drop to 1.75% by mid-2025. This expected drop in rates could also favor smaller, more indebted companies, which might benefit from increased mergers and acquisitions. However, these companies remain vulnerable to weak economic growth. Bell pointed out that a declining euro could enhance the competitiveness of European companies by reducing costs, though it might also discourage foreign investment. Furthermore, European firms heavily rely on sales from the US and China, as domestic sales within Europe have stagnated over the past two decades. In this context, lower interest rates could help stimulate economic growth and drive higher valuations for European stocks. However, Goldman Sachs remains cautious about the scale of this growth, particularly given persistent inflation concerns. While U.S. equities have recently outperformed their European counterparts, a shift in US valuations could make Europe a more attractive option for global investors. Supporting this outlook, dividends are emerging as a key contributor to European equity returns. For European companies, the average yield was 3.47% at the end of 2023 and it was projected to increase to 3.67% in 2024, remaining higher than long-term German government bond yields despite their significant rise in 2022. German companies reported a 3.3% dividend yield in 2023, which was expected to grow to 3.53% in 2024. The Allianz Global Investors Dividend Study highlighted the significance of dividends in equity investment returns. Over the past 40 years, dividends have accounted for nearly 36% of the annualized total return of European equities. Our Methodology For this article, we used the iShares DivDAX® UCITS ETF (DE) to filter out German dividend stocks. The ETF aims to replicate the performance of an index comprising 15 high dividend yield stocks selected from the 30 largest and most actively traded companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard segment. From this fund, we focused on picking prominent stocks with stable yields and strong dividend policies. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of December 27. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Dividend Yield as of December 27: 9.92% Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE), headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, develops, manufactures, and sells cars and vans under brands like Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Maybach, and G-Class. It also offers spare parts, financing, leasing, rentals, fleet management, insurance, and digital services for charging and payments. With an impressive dividend yield of 9.92% as of December 27, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) is one of the best German dividend stocks to buy. Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) reported revenue of €107,144 million for the first nine months of 2024, slightly below the €112,414 million from the prior year, due to lower unit sales, an unfavorable market mix, negative pricing, and exchange rate effects. In February 2024, the company announced a share buyback policy, allocating free cash flow beyond a 40% dividend payout to fund share buybacks. A €3 billion buyback program began in May 2024, following the completion of a €4 billion program in August 2024. The current program is expected to finish by Q1 2025, with future buybacks subject to corporate approvals. At its Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) approved a dividend of €5.30 per share for 2023, up from €5.20 in 2022. The total payout for 2023 amounted to €5.5 billion, slightly below the €5.6 billion distributed in 2022. Overall MBG.DE ranks 2nd on our list of the best German dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MBG.DE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

There was substantial innovation, but those just wanting to make money from investing in Ethereum's native coin ETH are a little disappointed—if the vibes on Crypto Twitter (aka X) are anything to go by. Upgrades like Dencun made it cheaper to get things done on the network, and President-elect Donald Trump even threw his weight behind a project built on Ethereum. But there was also a regulatory crackdown, leading many to think that the SEC was coming hard for the ecosystem. The surprising approval of spot ETH exchange-traded funds turned things around, but did not lead to an explosion in the asset’s price like it did with its Bitcoin counterparts. pic.twitter.com/ypp2wE4GLa — naiive (@naiivememe) November 14, 2024 Even so, it was still an exciting—and noteworthy—year for the blockchain behind the second-biggest coin in crypto. Here's a look back at how it all went down. In April, rumors started swirling that the SEC could be coming after Ethereum in its entirety after the Ethereum Foundation announced it was being investigated by a state authority. Then, Wall Street’s top regulator and one of the biggest names in the Ethereum space, software giant Consensys (disclosure: one of 22 investors in Decrypt), went to war. It started when the SEC hit the firm with a Wells notice, a warning of an impending lawsuit over securities violations, regarding its popular Ethereum wallet, MetaMask. Consensys snapped back with a preemptive suit against the SEC. The company alleged that the agency had secretly considered ETH to be a security for over a year, claiming that the regulator’s actions “would punish Consensys for accepting and acting in reliance on years of government assurance that ETH is not a security.” Then, the SEC sued Consensys for allegedly engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its MetaMask Swaps and Staking services. The Consensys lawsuit was thrown out by a judge in September. Trump winning has been both good and bad for the firm: The SEC will have a new, pro-crypto chairman if Trump's pick Paul Atkins is confirmed, but not before Consensys has had to cut its staff by 20% in October. The firm cited aggressive regulation and lawsuits as part of the reason. After the expected approval and huge debut trading months of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, industry observers didn’t think Ethereum would get the same green light—at least not right away—because the regulator wasn’t clear on whether the asset was a security or commodity. But in a surprise move, the SEC gave a thumbs-up. And two months after initial approvals, the spot ETFs began trading in July. But despair seemed to set in when the ETH price didn’t go up. The approval of the Bitcoin ETFs had pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high after all-time high. ETH hasn’t been so lucky: As of this writing, it still has a sizable gap to close until it breaks its 2021 record of $4,878. Even if Ethereum's price didn’t take off like a rocket, the approval of the ETFs delivered one important win: The SEC stopped calling ETH a securit. Despite previously saying in 2018 that the asset was not a security, outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler for years refused to answer on where the coin stood—and he hit crypto company after crypto company with lawsuits for allegedly selling unregistered securities. But the approval of the ETFs showed that the watchdog essentially agreed that the asset was decentralized enough to not be a security. This came with Wall Street recognition of ETH and its blockchain as an asset class—even if traditional finance has had a hard time getting its head around Ethereum’s value proposition. It helped that the really big names, like BlackRock boss Larry Fink, generated some momentum. The BlackRock CEO kicked off the year by saying that he saw “value” in an Ethereum ETF, and that it was a stepping stone towards “tokenization.” In March, the asset manager launched “BUIDL”—a tokenized fund running on Ethereum—and then later joined the fray with its own spot ETF. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned hard ahead of his victory to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” As part of his digital asset-focused agenda, he helped launch a project running on… you guessed it, Ethereum. First teased in August by his son, Eric, World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance project. Decentralized finance—or DeFi—is the crypto sphere that wants to make taking out a loan or lending automatic and easy via blockchain-based protocols. Most DeFi projects are built upon Ethereum, so it’s not a huge surprise that the Trump team went with the project, but still—it was big news for the community. WLF will provide borrowing and lending crypto services, the team behind the project said in an exclusive interview with Decrypt’s sister company, Rug Radio. The project launched and had a somewhat sluggish token launch—open only to accredited investors—but it’s still early days. Sources tell Decrypt that Team Trump also has plans to launch a native stablecoin, though it's a crowded market indeed. On the technical side of things, Ethereum got cheaper too—much cheaper. The network’s Dencun upgrade slashed transaction costs on its layer-2 networks. Such networks enable faster and cheaper transactions than on mainnet, and Dencun's addition of "proto-danksharding" technology trimmed costs even further for users. That's the good news. On the flip side, rising use of L2s has drawn value away from layer-1 Ethereum, which some in the crypto space believe is responsible for Ethereum's sagging price performance this year. In fact, VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel said in October that unless Ethereum gets a "model change," he projects that ETH's price will only hit $7,300 by 2030—as opposed to $22,000 under previous projections. Layer-2 networks are "taking more value from Ethereum" than previously expected, he posited. Luckily, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and others in the space are considering changes, such as fee-sharing models, that can provide more balance to the ecosystem so L2s don't become overly extractive.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 107 Matthew Bryson from Bright Lake Wealth Management said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that he believes Micron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) problems are temporary in nature. “I think that a lot of the problems are very temporal in nature. Certainly, the extent of the decline was a bit of a surprise. But where you’ve got inventory right-sizing in handsets of smartphones, that’s not an end-market problem. It’s that our customers took on too much inventory, mostly late 2023. It just needs to get worked out, and I think that’s done by the end of Q1. How can Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) make a turnaround? The company’s management expects PC unit growth to accelerate into the second half of calendar 2025. Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell has only just begun ramping up production and 2025 is expected to show improved sequential and annual comparisons. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) management has also guided for a return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and raised the estimate of the HBM market’s total addressable market to over $30 billion in 2025, driven by their sold-out position for the calendar year. Based on these factors, now could be the right time for long-term investors to pile into MU. Invesco Growth and Income Fund stated the following regarding Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU): In late June, Micron reported earnings that were generally in line with expectations. However, management provided weaker guidance going forward. The stock immediately began to sell off, which continued through the third quarter as investors appeared to question the company’s long-term growth outlook. Rotation out of AI-related stocks also appeared to weigh on Micron Technology.” Overall, MU ranks 5th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Bitcoin has rocketed higher through 2024, though a serious Federal Reserve warning has sparked fears of an imminent crash. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price topped $100,000 per bitcoin on the back of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory, described as a "tipping point" for crypto after Wall Street embraced spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Now, as BlackRock confirms a worrying bitcoin price bombshell, the bitcoin price has been predicted to be just weeks away from a "major" move as fresh bitcoin ETF filings are revealed. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's favorable attitude toward bitcoin and crypto is predicted to ... [+] help drive the bitcoin price higher in 2025. "If it’s true that a lot of the market makers are exposed to bitcoin given how much price movement there has been, then we’re only weeks away from the next major move," bitcoin and crypto investor Mike Alfred said during an X broadcast this week with podcaster Scott Melker, pointing to Friday's largest-ever bitcoin options expiry. Bitcoin's Wall Street adoption this year has been led by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock after its successful campaign to bring bitcoin ETFs to the U.S. last year, with the funds making their debut in January. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now has around $60 billion in assets under management, becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs ever. This week, two new ETFs designed to build on the growing trend of corporations adopting bitcoin treasuries were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF would invest in companies that have "adopted the 'bitcoin standard,'" defined as holding more than 1,000 bitcoin and meeting certain size and liquidity requirements. "I think in 2025, you’re going to see an explosion of interest in index space strategies that give diversified exposure to crypto," Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Bloomberg this week. "Of course, [that is] something we’ve been doing at Bitwise since 2017 when we pioneered that concept. I think 2025 is when that becomes a mainstream way to allocate to this space, the same way it is to stocks and bonds and real estate and everything else." Meanwhile, Strive, an asset manager cofounded by Vivek Ramaswamy who will lead the Trump administration's Doge department of government efficiency with Elon Musk, has filed to create the Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF, designed to provide "exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy ... or other companies that Strive ... expects will invest all or a significant portion of the proceeds to purchase bitcoin (collectively, 'bitcoin bonds')." "The bitcoin treasury operations virus is spreading," Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, posted to X. MicroStrategy, founded as a software company in pre-dot com bubble internet boom, has been transformed into what its cofounder and chairman Michael Saylor calls a "bitcoin treasury" company, outperforming the likes of stock market darling Nvidia as it funds its bitcoin buys with the sale of convertible notes and at-the-market share offerings. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, with many crypto market watchers predicting 2025 could be an ... [+] even bigger year for bitcoin and crypto. MicroStrategy has ridden the bitcoin price boom to an all-time high valuation, far outpacing bitcoin itself as traders use the company's stock as a bitcoin proxy and it now holds 444,000 bitcoin worth almost $42 billion. "This institutional adoption has a significant impact on stabilizing the market amid broad selloffs," Maksym Sakharov, cofounder of decentralized finance platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. "When U.S. president-elect Donald Trump takes office in the coming year, more corporate firms will enter the bitcoin ecosystem as the regulations become favorable. The groundwork for this favorable policy around bitcoin and the crypto industry has already been set. From an active bill to establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve for the country to the nomination of a pro-crypto U.S. SEC chair and crypto czar, the ecosystem might become attractive to many American institutions and investors next year."

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Car Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) stands against the other car stocks. The automotive industry has witnessed a constant churn of innovation over the last several decades, with car makers continuously providing drivers with new features. However, there has been a different pace of change lately, with the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) being the most talked-of topic in the industry. READ ALSO: 10 Best Used Car Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. A lot of the conversations in the automotive space currently revolve around robotaxis, the autonomous taxis for ride-hailing, especially after Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab in October this year. His company is showcasing the self-driving two-seater at several key locations across the United States in December, with plans to deploy the autonomous services in California and Texas in 2025. According to a report in Euro News, global EV sales surged in November, with a record-breaking 1.8 million units sold worldwide, overtaking the record set in the prior month by 100,000 units. China accounted for two-thirds of the sales during the month. Around 15.2 million EVs were sold between January and November, growing 25% year-to-date. The report stated a 3% decline in EV sales in the region comprising the United Kingdom (UK), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). With 280,000 units sold in November, annual sales for the region reached 2.7 million units. However, the UK is having an improvement in the second half of the year; sales have grown 17% from last year, driven by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. China is not only leading the EV market but is also on track to take over the global auto industry because of its massive and growing capacity. Earlier this month, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) highlighted that the country’s EV capacity will soon match its domestic auto demand, whereas China’s car production capacity is already half of the global demand for automobiles. It is projected to have a total output of 20 million electric vehicles in 2024, with production increasing between 4-5 million units annually, helped by heavy investments from Chinese firms to expand production. According to the New York Times, China also has the capacity to produce over 40 million internal combustion engine cars a year. India’s auto market is also seeing impressive growth, contributing significantly to the global market. Annual production of automobiles in the country stood at 25.9 million units in fiscal 2023. The thriving vehicle market has also resulted in a booming auto components industry, which has grown 11.3% during the first half of FY25, driven by strong demand for larger and more powerful cars. We sifted through screeners to identify stocks in the auto manufacturers, auto parts, and auto dealerships industries. From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best car stocks to invest in now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Based in Tempe, Arizona, the company operates an online platform to buy and sell used cars. In 2021, it was included in the Fortune 500 list, making it one of the youngest companies to be named in the list – just eight years after it was founded. The company experienced significant growth during the pandemic years, as the e-commerce industry boomed with restrictions on in-person shopping. However, CVNA’s fortunes suffered in 2022, burdened by high interest rates, rising costs of automobiles, and heavy debt. A year later, it turned things around again, with its share price increasing by over 1000%, driven by cost cuts and strategic debt restructuring. The growth story is still ongoing. As of December 26, its share price had surged by over 300% year-to-date, as the company focuses on enhancing operational efficiencies and cash flow. Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) is continuing to see strong demand for vehicles. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on October 30, the company reported a 34% increase in retail units sold from last year. Revenue for the quarter was $3.655 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Net income stood at $148 million, whereas operating income was posted at $337 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $429 million, with a margin of 11.7% – a new company record. EPS was logged at $0.64, beating expectations of 25 cents per share. Looking ahead, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) anticipates sequential growth in retail units sold in the fourth quarter of 2024 and adjusted EBITDA to be significantly above the high end of its previously communicated range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year. These forecasts have resulted in a bullish sentiment around the stock, with Wall Street analysts having a consensus Buy rating for CVNA. Hedge fund sentiment is improving as well. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 66 hedge funds held a stake in the company, up from 61 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now. Overall CVNA ranks 2nd on our list of the best car stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of CVNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is an Italian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of luxury sports cars. It also produces limited series and one-off cars. The company is active in around 60 countries and territories through its network of authorized dealers. Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for automakers, due to their reliance on auto parts from these countries. While Europe has largely been absent from Trump’s protectionist policies, there are concerns the region might be next to face similar scrutiny. However, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) remains unfazed by the chatter. When asked at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on December 10 whether the company would consider manufacturing cars in the United States, CEO Benedetto Vigna stated that Ferrari will always make its cars in Maranello, northern Italy, and that will not change even if tariffs are introduced. Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin believes that, unlike its competitors in the industry, Ferrari’s high-end clientele and exclusive market allow the company to absorb high tariffs by adjusting prices without considerably impacting demand. Its order book is already strong, and the sports car maker is planning to launch its first fully electric vehicle by Q4 2025. Ferrari’s financial performance remained robust. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 5, the company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenues to EUR 1.6 billion ($1.68 billion), with a net profit of EUR 375 million ($394 million). The company is seeing order book visibility well into 2026, driven by impressive order intake for the 12Cilindri coupe Spider, and the unveiling of the F80 Supercar. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating for Ferrari with an average share price upside potential of 16%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has also improved. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 36 hedge funds held a stake in Ferrari, up from 30 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now.

Title: 7 Reasons Why 2025 Could Redefine Crypto

Despite questions over regulation, lingering SEC lawsuits and scores of billion dollar zombie blockchain, bitcoin and the entire crypto market had a roaring comeback in 2024. Donald Trump at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, TN. (Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Crypto winter? Over. Fallen empires and courtroom drama? In the rearview. The survivors? Battle-tested and eyeing the horizon like it’s the next gold rush. After years of clashes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds have arrived. As of mid-December 16, U.S. bitcoin ETFs held $129 billion in assets, surpassing the $125 billion in gold ETFs, according to Norway-based K33 Research. A post-election cocktail of market euphoria and Donald Trump’s promises to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world” and establish a strategic bitcoin reserve sent bitcoin past $100,000. Solana is having a moment, fueled by memecoin hype and new categories like dePINs—networks that leverage blockchain tech to decentralize control and ownership of physical infrastructure. Platforms like Polymarket, where users bet on the outcome of U.S. presidential elections, and the battle royale game Off The Grid have found mainstream success. A new wave of “degens” are gambling on tokens like fartcoin and dogwifhat, both now with a market cap above $1 billion. “It’s the year that crypto moved into the mainstream consciousness in a way that it hadn’t since 2021, and that it is now a sustainable long-term asset class that is going to have a voice and is going to matter,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly, a San Francisco-based crypto venture capital firm. “If you look at just the effect that crypto had on the election—both as donors and in terms of bringing it forward in legislatures and for presidential candidates—that's never been done before and obviously a big step forward in legitimization.” With Trump and a cadre of crypto-friendly officials poised to take office, the stage is set for what insiders are already calling "crypto’s golden age." Here’s what’s brewing: The art of bold price prediction is back in vogue. Crypto asset manager Bitwise forecasts $200,000—or even $500,000—per bitcoin if the U.S. creates a strategic reserve akin to those for oil or gold. The logic: the U.S. official bitcoin stockpile would trigger global FOMO. Trump floated using 200,000 bitcoins confiscated from criminals (worth $21 billion) to jumpstart the reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin conference in July. But the legal pathway is murky—will it require Congressional approval, or can the executive branch act unilaterally? Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a Treasury-operated reserve in July. Skeptics argue the asset’s volatility could undermine financial stability. Trump's silence on whether the U.S. would acquire more bitcoin through open market purchases adds another layer of intrigue. The incoming administration is shaping up to be the most pro-crypto yet. Key appointments include: “There's a real opportunity to get good policy in place for the industry,” says Kristin Smith, CEO of Washington DC-based Blockchain Association, which represents more than 100 crypto companies. “The White House has indicated that this is a priority. I think we're going to see a combination of efforts across government, a legislative push for market structure and stablecoins and a big shift towards a lot of the innovation coming back to the US,” she adds. The pipeline of crypto IPOs is heating up. Bitwise names five companies likely to go public next year: Additionally, Dragonfly’s Hadick says, “I expect the LP market to get better—they’ll want to put more capital into crypto—and a lot of the traditional web 2 crossover funds return to the space. We are already starting to see it in certain pockets like stablecoins and payments.” But VC dealmaking tends to lag public market price rallies by a quarter or two, he adds. MicroStrategy’s stock is up over 400% this year. Now part of the Nasdaq 100, analysts predict S&P 500 inclusion is next thanks to new accounting rules that would allow it to reflect its bitcoin investments at market value in its financial statements. This change could usher MicroStrategy into index-tracking funds and hence the portfolios of countless U.S. investors. Cofounder and executive chairman Michael Saylor's "Bitcoin Treasury" play—selling bonds and equities to hoard the asset—has propelled his $86 billion enterprise into the ranks of the S&P 500's top 100 firms. Coinbase, up 70% this year, could also join the coveted index, according to analysts. The stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, potentially doubling to a $400 billion market cap as the U.S. edges closer to long-awaited stablecoin legislation. In 2024, stablecoin transactions’ volume reached $8.3 trillion, nearly matching Visa's $9.9 trillion in payment volume, according to Bitwise. Tether and Circle still reign supreme, riding the wave of high interest rates. However, if they continue to operate more like asset managers than payment companies, their growth could soon stall, cautioned Hadick. Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge in October sent a message—stablecoins could become cornerstones of fintech. Stripe hails them as “superconductors for financial services,” touting their unmatched speed, low cost, and global reach. Robinhood isn’t far behind with ambitions for a global stablecoin network. Meanwhile, next-generation “stablecoin 2.0” models are quietly gaining traction. “There are a bunch of new stablecoin models that are kicking back revenue to holders of the token, or actually the applications who onboard users,” explains Ceteris, head of research at New York-based crypto analytics firm Delphi Digital. “I could see those being disruptive.” Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been proselytizing tokenization for years. From real estate to art, everything might soon have a token. The big benefits: instantaneous settlement, lower costs than traditional securitization, round-the-clock liquidity and transparency. Three years ago, the crypto sector had only tokenized $2 billion in real-world assets (RWAs), including private credit, U.S. debt, commodities, and stocks. Today that figure is close to $14 billion. Venture capital firm ParaFi predicts that the tokenized RWA market could skyrocket to $2 trillion by 2030, heralding a significant transformation in asset ownership and trading. Buzzword of the month: AI agents. Get ready to witness the fusion of artificial intelligence and crypto in ways that feel closer to science fiction. The first shoots of this trend are already breaking ground. Look at TruthTerminal—an AI agent that not only pulled in $50,000 from Marc Andreessen but also became a millionaire by leveraging social media on X. Its success stemmed from promoting a coin based on an absurd early 2000s meme (the token’s anonymous creator(s) transferred a significant sum to TruthTerminal’s wallet, managed by creator Andy Ayrey). But analysts are wary. Practical AI agents—for example, those attempting to execute complex transactions across blockchains on behalf of users— are scarce and early. “Agents are exciting because they are so new,” says Delphi’s Ceteris, “but will probably be the biggest bubble of this cycle, for good and bad.” While the blockchain industry remains fragmented and most decentralized apps have not yet become mainstream, the work on a robust infrastructure continues. “Solana set the trend for the high throughput chain era (cryptospeak for blockchains capable of processing thousands of transactions per second similarly to Visa and MasterCard), and you're seeing nearly every new chain launch under this kind of umbrella so there’s going to be a lot of cheap block space,” Ceteris explains. And just like that, crypto's narrative has flipped from survival to euphoria. This is just a taste of what the next year could bring. Your choice: grab your popcorn for the show—or your wallet for the opportunity. Caution is essential. The market will swerve through inevitable highs and gut-check lows. And this time, the stakes seem to be higher than ever.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

This performance was largely driven by the Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS) segment, which saw its adjusted EBITDA surge by 115% to $174 million. These results were supported by the strong demand from the hyperscale and cloud data center business as the industry’s need for bandwidth and data center capacity continues to rise. In the third quarter, the company approved an additional capacity expansion project to meet the increasing demand for data center solutions. These investments are anticipated to yield high returns with short payback periods. Strategically, CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) is refining its focus.

Title: Why Is EPR Properties (EPR) Among the Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) stands against the other stocks that pay monthly dividends. Dividend stocks have long been a favorite among investors, regardless of the payout frequency. Companies, however, are deliberate in determining how often to reward their shareholders. Annual and semi-annual dividends might provide larger payouts, but their unpredictability can be challenging for investors. While major firms opt for quarterly payouts due to practicality, some choose monthly distributions, which many investors find attractive for the steady stream of passive income. In addition, a reduction in monthly payouts would have a smaller immediate impact, and receiving dividends monthly is one of the closest alternatives to a regular paycheck, simplifying the management of day-to-day finances. That said, history suggests that companies offering monthly dividends often boast higher yields but may lack consistent dividend policies. Regardless of market conditions, dividend stocks can be a useful tool for enhancing income and boosting portfolio growth potential. For instance, investors who are years away from retirement often reinvest their dividends to increase returns. According to an estimate by Charles Schwab, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in a broader market at the end of 1993 would have grown to over $182,000 by the end of 2023 if dividends were reinvested, compared to only $102,000 if they had not been reinvested. Also read: 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024 This means that investors looking to reduce their risk while still maintaining growth potential may want to consider high-quality dividend-paying companies. This approach is favored by Ramona Persaud, manager of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund. She tends to focus on shares of high-quality firms that offer attractive valuations and strong dividends. Persaud pointed out that falling interest rates can create a favorable environment for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also mentioned that lower interest rates may lead to gains across a wider range of stocks, a shift from the past two years when market gains were largely driven by a few large-cap growth stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "I'm excited that really good companies may get more credit from investors than they have during the wave of glamour stocks. And investors stand to gain from the stocks' dividend payments." Persaud prioritizes stocks with strong balance sheets, high potential returns on investment, and predictable cash flows. Additionally, she seeks out stocks with attractive dividend yields relative to similar companies and the broader market. Monthly dividend stocks also focus on high dividend yields, which can be a key draw. While high yields may sometimes indicate the possibility of dividend cuts or weaker balance sheets, many monthly dividend companies have been increasing their payouts for years and also maintain solid financial health. However, investors should exercise caution when investing in these stocks. High dividend yields are not inherently negative. Stocks with high yields can still uphold strong dividend policies if their business fundamentals are solid. Many companies with above-average yields have consistently paid and even increased their dividends over time. Research indicated that, in the long run, these stocks often provide superior returns. For instance, a University of Nevada study found that portfolios consisting of the top 10 highest dividend yield stocks from the Dow 30 index outperformed those with medium and low dividend yields between 1987 and 2012. The study also highlighted that investing in high dividend yield stocks can be profitable over the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations in returns. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A modern REIT building with a bright and inviting entrance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) leases its properties to various entertainment and educational businesses, including amusement parks, movie theaters, and ski resorts, across the US and Canada. As a triple net lease REIT, the company requires its tenants to cover all real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. It owns 352 properties and leases to over 200 tenants in 44 US states and Canada. In the past 12 months, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) has declined by over 10.4%. The company's reliance on the shrinking movie theater market is a significant concern. In 2023, only 852 million movie tickets were sold in the US, a sharp decline from 1.85 billion tickets in 2002, and this downward trend may persist. The rise of streaming platforms, affordable large-screen TVs, and increasing ticket prices have led more people to watch movies at home. Despite these challenges, the company achieved a 99% occupancy rate by the end of Q3 2024. It managed this by selling off vacant theaters, attracting more non-theater tenants for experiential businesses, and expanding its education-related property portfolio. During the quarter, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) finalized the sale of two theater properties and one early childhood education center, generating net proceeds of $8.7 million. The company's cash position remained strong. It ended the quarter with over $35.3 million of cash on hand with total assets amounting to nearly $5.7 billion. EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), one of the best dividend stocks, started paying quarterly dividends to shareholders since its IPO in 1997. The company shifted to monthly payments in 2013 and has paid regular dividends to shareholders since then. Its monthly dividend comes in at $0.285 per share for a dividend yield of 7.79%, as of December 28. As of the close of Q3 2023, 23 hedge funds held stakes in EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes are worth $247.4 million in total. Overall EPR ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks that pay monthly dividends in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Aristocrats List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) stands against the other U.K. dividend aristocrats. In recent years, investors have turned away from UK equities, opting instead for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies. The UK stock market is contracting at its fastest rate in over a decade, driven by takeovers of London-listed companies. According to Bloomberg data, approximately 45 companies have been delisted from the London market this year due to mergers and acquisitions, representing a 10% increase compared to the total for last year. This marks the highest number of delistings since 2010. Meanwhile, the value of deals targeting UK companies has surged by 81% this year, exceeding $160 billion. Earlier this year, UK equities seemed to be experiencing a shift in sentiment among both large institutions and smaller investors. The British stock market continues to attract bargain hunters, as UK equities are now trading at a record discount of over 40% compared to global counterparts, based on Bloomberg data. Many of the takeover targets have been mid-cap companies listed on London’s AIM market, which typically feature low trading volumes and limited analyst attention. That said, in November, investors returned to UK equity funds after three and a half years of consistent monthly withdrawals and a significant sell-off ahead of the Budget. Data from Calastone shows that retail investors directed a net £317 million into funds focused on UK stocks during the month. This inflow marks a notable shift, ending 41 consecutive months of net outflows, during which over £25 billion was withdrawn since May 2021. Also read: 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds The change in investor sentiment follows a challenging October for equity funds, which experienced record outflows as UK investors withdrew their money due to fears that the chancellor would raise capital gains tax (CGT). At the end of October, during the Budget announcement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed an immediate CGT increase. The lower rate rose from 10% to 18%, while the higher rate climbed from 20% to 24%. Analysts suggest the UK stock market could be nearing a recovery, but the timing and pace of this turnaround remain uncertain. This is where dividend stocks play a key role. Prioritizing stocks with rising dividends can offer stability and consistency through different market cycles. In addition, they provide an opportunity for long-term growth, compounding returns over time until share prices rebound. The UK market offers one of the highest dividend yields among major markets. The FTSE 100 boasts a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK companies, offers slightly lower yields but still provides attractive income opportunities. This allows investors to focus on higher-growth areas, such as smaller companies, while benefiting from increasing dividends. According to a report by BlackRock, currently, UK market dividends are growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Stocks with growing dividends typically have reliable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson's 2023 annual dividend report confirmed the rise in dividend growth, noting that the UK distributed approximately $86 billion in dividends in 2023, a notable increase from the $63.1 billion paid out in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks according to yield. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned over 40 holdings of the UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which tracks the performance of the highest-yielding UK companies with at least 7 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 28 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A student studying English language learning materials in a modern learning environment. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 2.01% Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a London-based multinational education company that focuses on a wide range of educational publishing and services. The stock has surged by over 132% since March 2020 as the publisher successfully adjusted to the changing online education landscape. The company took advantage of the pandemic, earning substantial profits from its virtual schooling services. It saw a 43% increase in enrollments in its virtual schools during the 2020-2021 academic year. However, in fiscal 2023, the company experienced a 20% drop in Virtual Learning sales due to reduced enrollments. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is generating strong earnings this year, delivering over 33% returns to shareholders since the start of 2024. In the first half of the year, the company reported revenue of £1.7 billion ($1.25 billion), down from £1.9 billion ($2.39 billion) in the same period last year. After 2025, the company is set to achieve a mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in underlying sales, along with continued margin improvements. This will result in an average annual increase of 40 basis points, driven by strong performance in its core business, realizing synergies, and expanding into related markets. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO)'s cash position came in strong in the first half of 2024. The company generated an operating cash flow of £185 million, up from £106 million in the prior year period. Its free cash flow showed an increase of £77 million at £27 million. This strong cash position has allowed the company to maintain its dividend payments for 33 years in a row. Currently, it offers an interim dividend of £0.074 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.01%, as of December 28. At the end of Q3 2023, 10 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO), compared with 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of nearly $33 million. Among these hedge funds, Arrowstreet Capital was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PSO ranks 10th on our list of the U.K. dividend aristocrats. While we acknowledge the potential of PSO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) stands against the other new stocks. US public markets continue to brace themselves for a 2025 resurgence, which should be led by interest rate cuts, pent-up investor demand, and a growing backlog of IPO expectations. As per PwC, there are over 700 unicorns in the private market as a result of the subdued IPO activity over the previous 3 years. Many IPO candidates, which also include some unicorns, have utilized this time to improve and strengthen their finances and transition to sustainable growth models. Apart from this, pressure continues to mount on private equity fund managers to return capital after an elongated exit dry spell, reported PwC. As per PwC, the traditional IPO market saw its gradual comeback in 2024, with proceeds garnered ~50% higher than in 2023 and ~4x the amount raised in 2022. The IPO activity was broad-based, with strong participation from sectors such as technology, life sciences, consumer markets, and financial services. Stock prices of this year’s traditional IPOs appreciated ~29%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s return of ~27% on a YTD basis (ended 26th December 2024). This highlights the strength, investor interest, and traction in new offerings. PwC went on to add that IPO activity saw a strong increase in 2024, with 61 traditional IPOs garnering more than $26.4 billion YTD, which was in line with the combined total number of IPOs in 2022 and 2023, which witnessed 28 and 35 IPOs, respectively. Despite this improvement, IPO activity remained short of early anticipations and historical levels of activity. This is because several IPO candidates decided to stay on the sidelines as they waited for a clearer economic picture after the U.S. presidential elections.

The continued rate cuts and a stable policy environment should boost investor confidence, which can help create more favorable market conditions. PwC gave a 60% probability of a “soft landing” scenario and a 20% probability of an optimistic “no landing.” Notably, both of these scenarios offer a supportive environment for IPOs. As per Lynn Martin, president of the NYSE, 2025 year will be an active one for the IPOs. Also, Reuters highlighted that reduced interest rates and inflation slowdown should act as catalysts for new listings. Furthermore, the expected easing of regulations under the new Administration paints a positive picture of the deal activity in capital markets. Bloomberg reported that, as per Goldman Sachs, the number of IPOs in the tech sector is expected to more than double next year. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that went public in the past 2 years. Next, we narrowed the list to the ones having high hedge fund positioning. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory technician wearing a lab coat holding a Petri dish with water samples. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) provides water analytics, water treatment, marking and coding, and packaging and color services. The company began trading as a publicly traded company on 2nd October 2023. Jefferies believes in Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s long-term growth potential, which should stem from its focus on mission-critical applications, consistent pricing power, and a strong direct-to-customer distribution channel. With the company’s recurring sales accounting for ~61% of total sales during the nine-month period that ended September 27, 2024, Wall Street believes that this provides some sort of stability of revenues. As per Jefferies, an acceleration in growth is expected in 2025, fueled by a recovery in consumer-packaged goods (CPG) and industrial markets. With industries seeking to reduce their water footprint and operating costs, there seems to be growing interest in closed-loop water systems and process water recycling. Therefore, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s capabilities in these areas should drive significant growth. As consumer demand stabilizes and increases, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) will witness improved volumes in its Materials & Chemicals (M&C) and Products & Consumables (P&C) subsegments. Jefferies believes that Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s combination of mid-single-digit (MSD) organic growth and healthy potential for strategic capital deployment places it well to compound its earnings at a double-digit rate. While Jefferies is bullish on Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO), Aristotle Capital Management, LLC recently sold its position because the firm believes that its other holdings within the water value chain are more optimal investments. Here is what the fund said: “In the fourth quarter of 2023, we received shares of the water and product quality company Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) when Danaher, a current Value Equity holding, spun off the business. After further assessing the now independently operated Veralto, we decided to exit our position. We believe our other holdings within the water value chain, including Xylem, American Water Works (our most recent purchase) and to some extent Ecolab, are more optimal investments.” Overall VLTO ranks 5th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VLTO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VLTO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British semiconductor and software design company. It was listed on NASDAQ on 14th September 2023. Wall Street believes that Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s latest v9 chip architecture continues to gain traction. This transition is significant because v9-based chips command increased royalty rates, potentially doubling or even quadrupling the fees the company receives per chip. The transition should act as a revenue driver as it affects Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s core mobile market, where it has a strong market position. As and when smartphone manufacturers upgrade their devices to incorporate v9-based processors, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) will benefit from increased royalty rates on a massive installed base. Furthermore, the enhanced capabilities of v9 architecture, which includes improved AI performance and security features, can ramp up adoption in other markets like automotive and IoT, further driving royalty growth. The compounding effect of increased royalty rates and expanding market applications should support topline and bottom-line growth. Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s energy-efficient chip designs are well-suited for an increased demand for on-device AI processing in smartphones, PCs, and other edge devices. The on-device AI market size was valued at US$17 billion in 2023 and should reach US$114.36 billion by 2031, as per Verified Market Research.

Title: This year in crypto – Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF approvals, ‘Trump pump,’ etc.

The year’s biggest development by far was the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The past year has been highly eventful. From Bitcoin’s [BTC] halving to the Ethereum [ETH] Spot ETF approval, from the quantum computing threat to Bitcoin briefly seizing headlines, here are some of the year’s big highlights. The biggest development by far was the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval. This came after some false alarms caused massive BTC price volatility, such as the one from Cointelegraph in October 2023. On 10 January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange traded products, or ETFs. Crypto Twitter went haywire, and investors were delirious at the idea of BTC being open to millions of mainstream investors. The emergence of BlackRock and Fidelity as two of the largest ETF funds was also a major boost to sentiment. They currently hold 550k and 200k BTC, respectively. From being a niche asset class, BTC is now open to the public. The funds are regulated and managed by some of the largest entities in the financial world. Michael Saylor, Co-founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has also been relentlessly buying Bitcoin. Other companies are beginning to stack BTC too. Source: Michael Saylor on X The Ethereum Spot ETF approval was also a boost to the industry. The 2024 presidential campaign spurred many debates about either candidate and the kind of administration they would bring. Trump’s embrace of crypto, his appearances at industry events, and his campaign promises made his administration’s pro-crypto position clear. This boosted crypto sentiment massively. In fact, the President-elect even made promises to make the USA the crypto-capital of the world. Policy reformations would probably be introduced to bring regulatory clarity. Trump also made public the intention to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a known crypto critic with a tendency to be aggressive in his oversight of crypto. Gensler would be stepping down on 20 January, Trump’s inauguration date. Whether he follows through on those promises remains to be seen. Election time saw the cryptocurrency-based prediction market Polymarket gain popularity. It allows users to gain or lose from the outcome of world events. During these elections, it massively favored Trump to be the victor, which turned out to be accurate. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025-26 In late September, Trump and his three sons announced World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) money market platform. Enthusiasts see this as a positive development, while critics brought the obvious conflict of interest to attention. WLF’s purchase of crypto tokens such as Chainlink [LINK] and Aave [AAVE] were transparent due to the nature of the blockchain, boosting these tokens’ prices. Source: DeFiLlama The DeFi ecosystem in general has also been thriving. The DeFi revival is apparent from the rising total value locked (TVL) across different chains. It was at $120 billion, at press time, closing in on the $170 billion high it made in late 2021 during the last cycle. Finally, Uniswap [UNI], the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, set records in November. Its monthly trading volume for a Layer-2 solution hit $38 billion, surpassing the $34 billion high it set in March 2024.
