Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns on Volatility Despite US-China Tariff Truce

Markets surged yesterday (May 12) on news of a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 climbing to its highest level in months. But BlackRock CEO Larry Fink remains wary of the economic turbulence tariffs could still bring. “There’s going to be a lot of volatility until we have greater certainty as to what is the new equilibrium,” the billionaire said today (May 13) at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh.

That said, he believes the path forward is becoming clearer. “The equilibrium is probably sooner than we thought maybe two to three weeks ago,” he added. The U.S. and China agreed yesterday to a 90-day pause on tariff escalation, scaling back their respective duties: U.S. tariffs are dropping from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China’s will decline from 125 percent to 10 percent. Despite the reprieve, investors remain cautious amid ongoing global economic uncertainty, with many opting for defensive strategies such as holding cash. “When there is that uncertainty, you’re going to keep more and more money in cash, and that’s what we’ve witnessed,” Fink said, noting that this is a global phenomenon. In Europe, he pointed out, 12 trillion euros are currently held in bank accounts, while U.S. money market funds are sitting on $11 trillion. Fink also emphasized that tackling economic uncertainty must include addressing the U.S.’s ballooning deficit—something he’s warned about in the past. “Let’s be clear: the U.S. deficits are an issue,” Fink said. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter. To reach a sustainable 3 percent growth rate, Fink said, the country will need to lean more heavily on private investment.

Title: Elon Musk Brings Starlink to Saudi Arabia as U.S. Oligarchs Join Trump in Middle East

Elon Musk says his satellite internet provider Starlink, a part of SpaceX, has been approved in Saudi Arabia for maritime and aviation use. The billionaire made the announcement while being interviewed at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, a conference where several American oligarchs have joined President Donald Trump to cut deals with the Saudi royal family. Musk “thanked the kingdom for approving Starlink,” referring to the Saudi government, without explaining further, and teased that he’d like to bring his nascent robotaxis to Saudi Arabia. “Yeah, so really you can think of a car or future cars as being robots on four wheels. And you know, I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom, indeed, if you’re amenable,” Musk said “You heard it here from Elon,” the interviewer said. “He’s bringing his robotaxi to the kingdom.” Musk didn’t offer any specifics and is long known as a bullshitter, so it’s not clear how serious the billionaire is about bringing robotaxis to the Middle East. Tesla plans to launch a trial of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, but details on that venture are still scarce. Musk also promoted his tunnel-digging venture, The Boring Company, while on stage, explaining that his goal was to “solve traffic” by digging tunnels underground. The billionaire hyped The Boring Company relentlessly during Trump’s first term but has only delivered the most pathetic results. Musk billed his ideas, like the Hyperloop and The Loop, as next-generation, high-speed answers for transportation. In the end, he’s only delivered a slow-moving Tesla driven by a human and hobbled public works projects. But that didn’t stop Musk from insisting that his only functional tunnel ride in Las Vegas, “feels like teleporting for one part of Vegas to another.” Most people do not describe the experience like that. Musk’s America PAC, one of the political arms the billionaire started to help get Trump elected in 2024, shared a video on X that included Musk talking about humanoid robots. Elon Musk's full remarks at the SaudiâU.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh pic.twitter.com/E6orrvgZYA — America (@america) May 13, 2025 “My prediction, actually, for humanoid robots is that ultimately they will be tens of billions,” Musk said, according to CNBC. “I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it, like, as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2. But even better.” President Trump was supposed to be the main attraction at the forum on Tuesday, and his presence in Saudi Arabia was extremely weird, to say the least. Trump opened his speech at the conference with organizers playing Lee Greenwood’s song “God Bless the USA,” as though it was the national anthem or something. Trump stood there in silence for the entirety of the song as the room all stood in silence. The camera periodically cut to Saudi leader Mohammad bin Salman, sometimes known as MBS, and he appeared to be stifling laughter. Trump, who earlier had trouble keeping his eyes open, largely focused on U.S. domestic politics and his personal grievances during the speech, which may not have been exceptional if he had been on American soil. Historically, it’s more normal for U.S. presidents to expand their focus when traveling overseas and not bring up petty matters in an international setting. These aren’t normal times, of course. Several American business leaders were spotted in Riyadh on Tuesday, including Palantir CEO Alex Karp, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even announced his company would be selling 18,000 of its latest AI chips to Saudi Arabia, according to CNBC. But not every tech oligarch was on hand for the forum. In fact, Trump called out Apple’s CEO saying during his speech that, “Tim Cook isn’t here,” apparently upset about that for some reason. “This week there are multi-billion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, they’re all here… Uber, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, and many more,” Trump said. “So I want to congratulate everybody. So many great business executives, many of you… most of you, I know.” Trump went on to say “they weren’t that happy when they saw me,” apparently referring to his election in Nov. 2024, “and now they’re saying, sir, you’re doing a great job, thank you very much. It’s amazing what a rising market will do.” And Trump isn’t altogether wrong. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who criticized the president during his first term, was spotted meeting with both MBS and Trump in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Altman has been rallying behind Trump, as AI boosters believe the Republican president can help inject money into their technology. Trump has held close ties to MBS and the Saudi royal family, even after the leader became an international pariah during Trump’s first term. Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the order of MBS in Istanbul, Turkey, but Trump has always cozied up to the most brutal dictators around the world while denigrating the leaders of liberal democracies. President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would be buying $600 billion of military equipment. And Trump’s tech buddies, from Musk to Altman, are happy to go along for the ride as long as it helps their bottom line. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: The inflation fight isn't over. Forecasters expect tariffs to show up in prices as soon as next month
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-april-cpi-tariffs-prices-trump-trade-war-economci-outlook-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-13T17:07:49Z
Full Content:
Americans got some relief from inflation last month, but top forecasters say the effects of the trade war aren't yet being reflected in the data, and the coming months could see a fresh spike in prices. The consumer price index cooled unexpectedly in April, with the overall inflation rate dipping to 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.4% in March. But consumers might be navigating another bout of inflation in the coming months. For one, the data is backward-looking and takes time to appear in official statistics. Firms, meanwhile, appeared to stockpile inventory in the first quarter to avoid tariff-related costs. Advanced imports of consumer goods surged as much as nearly 30% during the quarter, Morgan Stanley said. "This number doesn't matter, because the tariff effects are really going to start to show up in next month's number," Ellen Zentner, the chief economist strategist at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division, told CNBC on Tuesday after the CPI report. Higher numbers in next month's CPI data imply that prices will start to increase for consumers as soon as this month. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said he believed the inflationary impact from tariffs would "escalate" in the summer months. At the moment, there's little evidence to suggest tariffs have affected inflation, besides a slight increase in auto prices, he wrote on Tuesday. John Kerschner, the head of US securitized products and a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, also said he believes inflationary pressures from tariffs could show up starting in June. "Thus, the market will wait with bated breath for those readings to make a determination of where we actually stand on tariff-induced rising prices," he wrote in a note. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel speculated that price increases could come over the next several months. "Again, I don't think we're going to be seeing the effects of this tariff until, you know, maybe June or July. Because so little actually did come into this country and then get priced at the retail level and then sampled by the government officials to get in," Siegel told CNBC prior to the CPI report. Banks have adjusted their forecasts for inflation and economic growth after the US struck a deal with China to lower tariffs for 90 days, but many on Wall Street are still anticipating higher inflation by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs estimated that core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise from 2.6% annually in March to 3.6% by the end of the year. "Our forecast reflects a sharp acceleration in most core goods categories," the bank wrote in a note, adding that it believes tariffs would cause the "most acute" price increases in consumer electronics, autos, and apparel. "There was maybe a hint of tariffs in the data as a few line items with significant imports-household furnishings, medicinal drugs, IT commodities, and toys-saw price increases accelerate this month. But we continue to expect clearer evidence in the months ahead," Bank of America analysts wrote following the CPI release. Economists have warned that tariffs could stoke inflation for Americans, as companies could pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. The average effective US tariff rate will likely end up somewhere around 17%, the Yale Budget Lab estimated this month. That's lower than previous forecasts, but still the highest average tariff rate the US has seen in more than 80 years, Siegel said. Jump to

Title: Capital Markets: New Zealand pushes for renewable investment amid high demand, setbacks

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Genesis Energy's Waipipi wind farm in South Taranaki. Photo / Brett Phibbs, PhibbsVisuals THREE KEY FACTS New Zealand is being promoted as the “smart choice” for investors in renewable electricity, where tens of billions of dollars must be spent in the capital-hungry sector to meet demand and environmental goals. The new push to attract big money came at the New Zealand Infrastructure Investment Summit in March and following the event, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says it is seeing “significant investor interest” among developers and investors from Japan, Korea, Britain, Germany and from investor migrants through the Active Investor Plus visa programme. As of early May, the renewable energy prospectus released during the summit had been viewed 358 times and downloaded 85 times. The big push for capital comes at a time when there have been high-profile setbacks for large-scale renewable projects and the abrupt exit of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, after a solar power investment soured. Fast-track consenting processes are now in place but so is a growing queue to have projects considered under new rules. But energy experts at one law firm describe the renewable investment opportunity as “immense” and in a prospectus released by the Government at the summit, the case for it was set out. “With an abundant supply of renewable energy, robust renewable foundations and growing energy demands, New Zealand is the smart choice for your investment.” As New Zealand progresses towards its net-zero aims by decarbonising every sector of the economy, this country’s reliance on electricity is projected to soar, with demand growing by 60% over the next 25 years. To meet this, industries will increasingly rely on our abundant supply of renewable energy. “This presents an enticing proposition, not only to invest in New Zealand’s growing renewable energy and green fuel sectors, but to use our natural resources to your business’s advantage,” the prospectus from Invest NZ says. “Proximity to export markets in Asia and Australia and the country’s strong sustainability goals positioned the renewable energy sector to grow exponentially – benefiting the planet and investors alike.” While in 2023, around 88% of New Zealand’s electricity was generated from renewable sources, there was “huge growth potential” to power industrial processes and transport with clean energy as electrification drives demand. A MinterEllisonRuddWatts report into investing in the renewable energy sector, published last December, says the Government’s domestic target of doubling renewable generation by 2050 will help drive an increase in its electricity supply by close to 70% by 2050 to meet domestic needs, as the New Zealand economy electrifies. In real terms this equates to approximately 400-500 megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity needed every year through to 2050 – a rate of development never seen in this country before. The firm also notes that to support all this new generation, it is estimated at least $22 billion of investment in the distribution network is needed this decade. “Accordingly, the opportunity for investing in renewable energy projects and the associated infrastructure needed is immense, with long-term returns.” Another MinterEllisonRuddWatts report, on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the renewables sector, was published just before the summit and shows high levels of activity. It says as of September last year, there had been more than 160 projects, predominantly wind and solar. Because not all projects in the pipeline will be completed (or complete under current ownership), there remains scope for new entrants, strategic investment and, more relevantly, consolidation or sell-down by existing investors and developers. Independent developers may continue to struggle to secure bankable, offtake arrangements, such as a PPA (power purchase agreement) for a project. It says the New Zealand PPA market is immature and a lack of offtake impacts funding decisions, so some projects may need to be sold. Last year was a busy one for M&A in the renewables sector. MinterEllisonRuddWatts noted that: ● Singapore-based fund management company SC Oscar acquired 100% of utility-scale solar developer Rānui Generation. ● Lodestone announced the acquisition of two grid-level solar sites in Manawatū from Kiwi Solar. ● Genesis Energy secured an advanced stage, 127-megawatt peak (MWp) consented site near Edgecumbe in Bay of Plenty from Helios Energy. ● In September, Contact Energy Ltd entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to acquire up to 100% of the shares in generator and wholesaler Manawa Energy Ltd through a scheme of arrangement. The deal values Manawa at $1.86b. ● Genesis took a $64 million, 65% stake in EV charging company ChargeNet NZ Ltd, reflecting Genesis’ ambition to be one of the major players in EV charging networks. ChargeNet has more than 400 fast-charging points nationwide and Genesis’ investment is expected to boost the pace of network development. The Government’s Invest in New Zealand prospectus points to global demand for renewables skyrocketing – and New Zealand is perfectly positioned to meet it, thanks to an abundance of accessible resources generated by hydro, wind, solar and geothermal. Developments in hydrogen and other biofuels also offer significant investment opportunities and excellent export potential. Although big energy users and consumer groups have different views, the Government’s pitch says the country’s energy and electricity markets are mature and open-access. The Electricity Authority monitors the market to ensure fair competition and consumer protection. The Government says it is committed to ensuring businesses have access to secure electricity at internationally competitive prices. At this year’s New Zealand Energy Conference, the Major Energy Users Group warned of the risk of de-industrialisation, with energy-intensive industrial sectors gradually moving their production elsewhere or reducing levels of production here. It said increases in transmission and distribution charges were impacting all consumers and with fewer parties supplying gas, businesses were “having trouble getting long-term gas contracts alongside electricity at reasonable prices”.

Title: Institutional Investors Drive Surge in Bond ETFs

BlackRock expects bond ETF assets to more than triple to $6 trillion worldwide within five years. Bond exchange-traded funds have been racking up investment inflows over the last few years and continue to gather steam, thanks in large part to institutional investors, according to BlackRock. The asset management giant forecasted bond ETF assets to more than triple, to $6 trillion worldwide, by the end of the decade. According to a BlackRock report, it took 17 years for bond ETF assets to reach $1 trillion in 2019 and then just another five years for that figure to climb to $1.7 trillion as of the end of September 2024. “The global bond ETF industry is growing faster than expected,” the report stated. “A key driver of this growth has been the adoption of fixed-income ETFs by institutional investors.” According to BlackRock, the 10 largest asset managers—and nine of the 10 largest insurance companies—along with some central banks, are using the investment vehicle. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The report also stated that growing use of actively managed ETFs has contributed to the sharp rise in bond ETF assets. The report found that while bond ETF growth has traditionally been fueled by index-based investments, that source has expanded to now include actively managed ETFs, which provide access to sub-asset classes that are more difficult to index. “Historically, active strategies have only been available in mutual funds or separate accounts,” the report stated. “Today, however, the expanding landscape of active fixed income ETFs enables institutional investors to access these same strategies.” The report cited a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of institutional investors that found that nearly 25% of respondents are considering investing in active ETFs over the next year or two. “Increasingly, active ETFs are becoming critical components in fixed-income portfolios alongside index and enhanced index strategies,” the report stated. “In fact, over the past three years, U.S. actively managed bond ETFs have outpaced the growth of index ETFs at an annualized 26% rate.” According to the BlackRock report, actively managed strategies currently account for 14% of U.S. fixed-income ETF assets under management and 8% of total U.S. ETF assets. “The growth rate of active ETF assets is expected to outpace total ETF growth in coming years, in part driven by the evolving demands from the institutional investor base,” the report stated.

Donald Trump’s first visit to Saudi Arabia as president for the second time came with some standard fare, like an unbelievably massive arms deal he signed on Tuesday. Less orthodox is the lunch scheduled for today, which featured leading executives in American business and finance as well as a few random hangers-on. The lunch was part of a summit in which Saudi leaders agreed to a purported investment of $600 billion in American companies, mostly working in tech, artificial intelligence, and, of course, defense contractors. (Of the $600 billion sum, $142 billion will go to American defense firms selling missile systems, training, and the like.) To prepare for the glut of oil money coming their way, the president invited many leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI; Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir; Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton; Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia; and Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon. Most of the names on the list make sense. If you’re looking at boosting Saudi investment in U.S., you probably want BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman there. If you’re looking at further investment in American AI, Altman, Huang, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna are going to be munching apps, too. Obviously, Elon Musk is going to be there. But there are a few standouts. Why the mayor of Miami in Riyadh? What are the CEOs of Coca-Cola or Epic Games doing there? And what about Travis Kalanick, the former bad boss of Uber? The answer is kind of obvious: Saudi money and/or Trump fealty. For example, Kalanick’s latest venture is a ghost-kitchen company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — which is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the Middle East. Or take Miami mayor Francis Suarez, a staunch cryptocurrency booster who has backed the president’s pro-crypto industry policies. Despite leading the 42nd-largest U.S. city, he ended up with a ticket. Beyond securing the $600 billion promise, Trump, for one, did not seem especially focused at the meeting, commenting on Apple CEO Tim Cook’s absence and bragging about winning “all seven swing states.” But the real question remains this: Why isn’t the McDonald’s CEO there?

Title: Trump secures $600 billion Saudi investment pledge on Gulf tour

US President Donald Trump secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States after the oil power accorded him a gala welcome at the start of a tour of Gulf states.Trump punched the air as he emerged from Air Force One to be greeted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on energy, defence, mining, and other areas.The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, according to a White House fact sheet that called it "the largest defense cooperation agreement" Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said."Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum," the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a US-Saudi Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Trump's visit. U.S. President Donald Trump is greeted as he attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER)"We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion," he said.Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. Reuters reported in April that the US was poised to offer the kingdom an arms package worth well over $100 billion."I really believe we like each other a lot," Trump said during a meeting with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.The US and Saudi Arabia had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom is long thought to have been interested in.It was not immediately clear whether those aircraft were covered in the deal announced on Tuesday.Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. "While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of asset manager Blackstone; and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Musk chatted briefly with both Trump and the crown prince, who is otherwise known as MbS, during a palace reception for the US president. And joining Trump for a lunch with MbS were top US businessmen including Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.MbS has focused on diversifying the kingdom's economy in a major reform programme dubbed Vision 2030 that includes "Giga-projects" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium.

"While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A.

Their relations were strained by the 2018 killing of Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US intelligence believed the killing was ordered by MbS. He denied involvement.Trump did not include Israel on his schedule although he wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the Gaza war.Israeli officials have put a brave face on Trump's decision but there are growing doubts in Israel about its position in his priorities as frustration mounts in Washington over the failure to end the 19-month-old war.Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups' leaders, have at the same time given Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies.US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman at the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program.

President Trump signed the economic cooperation agreement with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and co-chaired the Saudi–U.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh. During the forum, Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, said that the Saudi state giant is signing today a $3.4-billion agreement to expand the Motiva refinery in Texas to integrate chemicals production. Motiva Enterprises, controlled by Saudi Aramco, operates the huge Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery is the second largest in the United States by operable capacity, after Marathon Petroleum’s 631,000-bpd refinery at Galveston Bay, Texas, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration as of January 1, 2024. Currently, the Motiva refinery produces conventional gasoline, commercial aviation fuel, ultra low sulfur diesel, export (high cetane) diesel, and Texas low emissions diesel. Aramco is also signing on Tuesday agreements with U.S. companies NextDecade and Sempra, Nasser said at the forum. “The US is really a good place to put our investment,” Nasser noted. Aramco is signing a memorandum of understanding with Sempra to receive about 6.2 million tons per year of LNG, the executive added. Last year, Aramco signed a non-binding agreement to buy LNG from Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG project and potentially acquire 25% in the project’s Phase 2. Under the non-binding Heads of Agreement (HoA), Aramco and Sempra discussed a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for LNG offtake of 5.0 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion project. The Saudi-U.S. investment forum was also attended by Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, and Elon Musk, among other prominent U.S. entrepreneurs.

Title: It Awaits Your Experiments
URL: https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=11511
Time Published: 2025-05-13T15:27:47Z
Full Content:
You may have heard of Christian Bök. You may have read about him on this very blog if you’ve been hanging out here long enough. Perhaps you were even one of the very select few to witness the seminal talk I gave back in 2016[1]—“ScArt: or, How to Tell When You’ve Finished Fucking”— which climaxed with a glowing description of Bök’s magnum opus, then still in progress. And if you read Echopraxia, you’ll have encountered—without even knowing it— a brief cameo of that work near the end, suggesting that at least in the Blindopraxia timeline, he’d brought his baby to fruition. Truth to tell, I didn’t know if he was actually going to pull it off for the longest time. I thought he’d given up years ago. The story so far: back in the early two-thousands Christian Bök, famous for accomplishments lesser poets would never even dream of attempting (he once wrote a book in which each chapter contained only a single vowel) started work on the world’s first biologically-self-replicating poem: the Xenotext Experiment, which aspired to encode a poem into the genetic code of a bacterium. Not just a poem, either: a dialog. The DNA encoding one half of that exchange (“Orpheus” by name) was designed to function both as text and as a functional gene. The protein it coded for functioned as the other half (“Eurydice”), a sort of call-and-response between the gene and its product. The protein was also designed to fluoresce red, which might seem a tad gratuitous until you realize that “Eurydice”’s half of the dialog contains the phrase “the faery is rosy/of glow”. Phase One involved engineering Orpheus and Eurydice into the benign and ubiquitous E. coli, just to work out the bugs. Ultimately, though, the target microbe was Deinococcus radiodurans: also known as “Conan the Bacterium” on account of being one of the toughest microbial motherfuckers on the planet. To quote Bök himself: Astronauts fear it. Biologists fear it. It is not human. It lives in isolation. It grows in complete darkness. It derives no energy from the Sun. It feeds on asbestos. It feeds on concrete. It inhabits a gold seam on level 104 of the Mponeng Mine in Johannesburg. It lives in alkaline lakelets full of arsenic. It grows in lagoons of boiling asphalt. It thrives in a deadly miasma of hydrogen sulphide. It breathes iron. It breathes rust. It needs no oxygen to live. It can survive for a decade without water. It can withstand temperatures of 323 k, hot enough to melt rubidium. It can sleep for 100 millennia inside a crystal of salt, buried in Death Valley. It does not die in the hellish infernos at the Städtbibliothek during the ﬁrebombing of Dresden. It does not burn when exposed to ultraviolet rays. It does not reproduce via the use of dna. It breeds, unseen, inside canisters of hairspray. It feeds on polyethylene. It feeds on hydrocarbons. It inhabits caustic geysers of steam near the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park. I’d love to quote all seven glorious and terrifying pages, but to keep within the bounds of Fair Use I’ll skip ahead to the end: It is totally inhuman. It does not love you. It does not need you. It does not even know that you exist. It is invincible. It is unkillable. It has lived through five mass extinctions. It is the only known organism to have ever lived on the Moon. It awaits your experiments. As things turned out, it had to await somewhat longer than expected. The project hinged upon molecular techniques that did not exist when the experiment began. Christian taught himself the relevant skills— genetics, proteomics, coding— and enlisted a team of scientists (not to mention a supercomputer or two) to invent them. His audacity was more than merely inspiring; some might even call it infuriating. As I railed back in 2016: It was fine when Art came to science in search of inspiration; that’s as it should be. I suppose it was okay— if a little iffy— when Science started going back to Art for solutions to scientific and technical problems. But this crosses a line: with The Xenotext, we have reached the point where Science is being used solely to assist in the creation of new art. Scientists are developing new techniques just to help Christian finish his bloody poem. Up to now, we’ve generally been in the driver’s seat. Insofar as a relationship even existed, Science was the top, Art the Bottom. But Art has now started driving Science. Science has discovered its inner sub. As a former scientist myself, I was not quite sure how to feel about that. But however that was, I knew Christian Bök was to blame. Fortunately, Science got a reprieve. The project hit a bump at E. coli. Eurydice fluoresced but the accompanying words got mangled. When they eventually cleared that hurdle and moved to Phase Two, Deinococcus fought back, shredding the code before it ever had a chance to express. Conan, apparently, does not like people trying to play with its insides. It’s already got its genes set up just the way it likes them. Unkillable. That, as far as I knew, was where the story ended ten years ago. Christian released The Xenotext: Book One in 2015, documenting his efforts and gift-wrapping them in some gorgeous and evocative bonus content, but the prize remained out of reach. He headed off to Australia to follow other pursuits; then to that oversurveilled and repressive shithole known as the United Kingdom. We fell out of touch. I assumed he’d given up on the whole project. Oh me of little faith. Because now it’s 2025, and he fucking did it. The Xenotext is live and glowing in Deinococcus radiodurans: iterating away inside that immortal microbial bad-ass that feeds on stainless steel, that resides inside the core of reactor no. 4 at Chernobyl, that does not die in the explosion that disintegrates the Space Shuttle Columbia during orbital reentry. Christian Bök did not give up. Christian Bök did not fail. Christian Bök is going to outlive civilization, outlive most of the biosphere itself. The rest of us might think we achieve artistic immortality if our work lasts a century or three. Bök blows his nose at such puny ambitions. His work might get deciphered by Fermi aliens who finally make it to our neighborhood a billion years from now. It could be iterating right up until the sun swallows this planet whole. It’ll almost certainly be around for Dan Brüks to find in the Oregon desert, mere decades down the road. The Xenotext: Book Two comes out from Coach House in June 2025. It would be well worth the price just for the the acrobatics and anagrams and sonnets, for the way it remixes science and fiction and the classic canon of dead white Europeans[2]. It contains poetry to entrance people who hate poetry. It juggles space exploration and the Fermi Paradox and the potentially extraterrestrial origins of Bacteriophage φx174. But its rosy flickering heart is that dialog iterating away in Conan even as I type. A reinvention, almost a quarter-century in the making. A fucking monument if you ask me, equal parts revelation and revolution. If you happen to live in or around Toronto, it’s getting an official launch on May 27 at The Society Clubhouse, 967 College St, from 7-9pm. It’s one of a half-dozen Coach House titles that will be launched that night, and no doubt all six authors are worthy in their own right. Still. You know who I’m going for. Maybe I’ll see some of you there. Δ Δ Literature encoded into juggernaut microbial genes by a man who, facetiously taking at face value the Mooring-dialect North Frisian meaning of his surname, is literally called Bible. This has apocalyptic implications Inb4 Pope Influenza I Clever. But can it sing “Row, row, row your boat”? I think that’s on the list. Right after “evolve opposable thumbs”. A bacterium with opposable thumbs? Fair shot, it can’t do much worse than H sapiens has. Several lifetimes ago, waaaay back when I was hilariously crashing out of premed, I can remember the biochem prof cited this one weird trick—where a single DNA sequence expresses multiple proteins just by adjusting the read offset—as evidence of God’s handiwork. Although personally I think it much more compelling evidence that Earth is a vast massively parallel supercomputer with lovely crinkly bits grinding the combinations for 10 million 3.5Bn years. Never send a brain to do an algorithm’s work, that’s my motto nowadays. And DNA’s already halfway to Forth. Tip o’ the hat to Mr Bök for his God-level advance trolling of whatever race of hyperintelligent cockroaches eventually arises in our wake. Only the paperback? What is wrong with the publishing industry today? If I’m okay with read-and-forget, I’d buy a pdf or whatever the current thing is, epub or mobi or whatever. If I’m willing to both shell out and spend the precious shelf space in my shoebox of a domicile on some sliced dead wood, I’d want it to be durable. Physical. Bequeathable. Hard-cover. What’s this obsession with paperbacks? They don’t really last, and don’t save any more trees either. And I’ll be fucked if this right here is the kind of literature one reads on the tube during the commute, folding the corner instead of a bookmark before shoving it into the pocket of one’s coat. Xenotext doesn’t need to be read by puny meatsacks. Xenotext is immortal. I mean, the text that is not meant to be read, the signal that is not meant to be received, the meaning that is not meant to be understood is just noise. Isn’t it? And a large part of our problem right now is we make too much noise. Not in the sense of loud sounds, but in the sense of rubbish, garbage, bonkers signals. Rorschach is known to consider these things an attack. I’m not the only person who finds paperbacks easier to read. >Christian taught himself the relevant skills – genetics, proteomics, coding – Sentences like these demonstrate the enormity of some peoples sheer intellectual superiority. Compared to a dude like him, i might as well be pond slime, happily gurgling away mindlessly in some nutrient broth. I am beyond impressed. Holy shit, this is one of those stories that remind you to never quit art, even if you are not sure if you are on board with this life thing anymore. Thank you for bringing it up, Dr. Watts 🙂 Nice. Apropos of nothing, apparently quantum energy teleportation has been confirmed. It’s not the telematter stream sending antimatter yet, but it looks interesting. One can hope we will NOT live to see ads casually added into someone’s genetic material …? Well, by the time Echopraxia takes place, you can apparently find the specs for the Denver sewer system in genes, so… If it encodes a useless protein, does that make it a disadvantageous trait that will be eliminated by selection pressure? More likely it’ll be selectively neutral; a single gene doesn’t take a whole lot of energy to maintain, and our own genomes are loaded with useless-but-non-deleterious code that’s accumulated over our evolutionary history. If there were some teensy Deinococcus-eating predator out there that hunted by sight, I suppose the glowing Conans would be more vulnerable to predation. Otherwise I don’t think it would make much difference. Ah. What I think is more like this: synthesising bioluminescent proteins consumes organic matter but produces no benefit. This should at least cause natural selection to favour their unmodified counterparts? Perhaps we should also deploy some versions with gene poem that don’t express, just as a backup. “Useless” is relative: to random mutation it’s all raw materiel. Sure it’s non-coding today, but rotate a few bits just-so and it’s sharks with fricking laser beams evolved on their heads tomorrow. […] Read More […] : : : DO NOT TAUNT THE XENOTEXT : : : You’ve heard about Moore’s law but have you heard about Carlson curve? It’s a similar thing but for DNA sequencing. Between the year Bök has begun his work and the current year the cost of DNA sequencing has been reduced by 200%. In twenty something years any basement dwelling punk might pull this off. I hadn’t, so looked it up. WP’s graph is lagging but it looks like cost has dropped a whole magnitude over the last 10 years. Did you mean 2000%? Quite impressive when the 2001 bill for a human genome was $100M and now it’s approaching $100. Six magnitudes. Moore, clocking 4, looks distinctly sedate. I like my cyberpunk with 1980s electronics and 2080s genomics. “I just do eyes…” Damn straight. — Apropos of other things, tweaking Interstellar’s “Mountains” to ⅛ tempo makes an interesting Oort cloud experience for those needing a Big Ben fix. (Use a YouTube downloader to grab it as .mp3 file as YT shits ads all through it otherwise.) Damn, that’s impressive. Not just that he pulled this off, but that he took his dedication to his art up to a whole different level. May ’25 • UK funds a series of geoengineering experiments to “buy time” in the race against climate change. Small-scale and cautious, they say. Ecologically sound, they say. Will certainly not be used as an excuse to not cut carbon emissions, they say. We’ll see. April ’25 • Trump opens protected marine conservation area to commercial fishing. Because of course. PopSi coverage here. • Latest marine heatwave leaves over 80% of the world’s coral reefs impacted by bleaching. On the upside, this is an official NOAA report on an ongoing environmental catastrophe. I thought they weren’t allowed to do that any more. • Bypassing the International Seabed Authority, Trump signs executive order opening the deep sea for commercial mining. Because why refrain from fucking up an ecosystem just because it’s out of sight? • Ocean heatwaves three times longer and 1°C hotter thanks to climate change. Only a paywalled preview link because the University of Toronto seems to have inexplicably stopped subscribing to PNAS, and I can’t find the paper on Sci-Hub. PopSci summary here • “Entire asset classes are degrading in real time”. Top insurance company warns that climate change is “on track to destroy capitalism“. And yet, they say that as though it’s a bad thing. March ’25 • Canadian company in negotiations with Trump to mine seabed. Because MAGATs aren’t the only assholes on the planet. • South Korean wildfires worst on record. • Another new buzzword for these times: “Global Weirding“. AKA, “climate whiplash”. • BP abandoning its net-zero pledges because, well, why the fuck not? They were empty anyway. February ’25 • Looks like the odds are the AMOC won’t be collapsing completely before the end of the century— just “significantly weakening” by 50-80%. After 2100, though, all bets are off. Summary article here. • NOAA is now refusing to mention the C-words when reporting record-breaking global temperatures. • Last January hottest on record: 1.75°C above preindustrial baseline. So much for La Niña cooling the place down. • “1.5°C is dead” is so passe. Based on these findings, James Hansen now says that 2°C is dead, too. In other news, the North Pole is 20°C warmer than it should be. Assuming it’s not just some Chinese hoax. January ’25 • Net Zero has “suspended operations” after Blackrock bails (the last straw in an ongoing procession of desertions from the world’s financial institutions). • Four of Canada’s largest banks have also quit Net-Zero. • I just learned a new word: “panzoonotic”. H5N1 is one. So far it’s infected over 48 mammalian species. • Lancet study estimates civilian deaths in Gaza at around 64,260 from Oct 7 2023, to June 30 2024. Fun fact: that’s about 70% higher than estimates from the supposedly Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. • The six biggest banks in the US have all bailed on Net Zero. Because who cares about that shit now that Trump’s back in charge? • Looks like a sea level rise of at least 1 m is now inevitable no matter what we do, as early as 2070 under current emissions. 2-3m is “very likely”. On the plus side, that means most of the world’s oil ports will be underwater in less than fifty years. December ’24 • Over half the current US population has been exposed to adverse concentrations of lead, resulting in elevated levels of mental illness. Explains a lot. • Geoffrey Hinton ups his guesstimate of AI-caused Human extinction to “10-20%” over the next 30 years. Honestly, at this point, the sooner the better. • 2024 officially the “hottest year on record“. • A whole new potential kind of environmental apocalypse: “mirror life“, based on biomolecules of reversed chirality. I’m sure we have nothing to worry about, though, now that the scientists have warned us of the dangers. Society always listens when scientists warn it of the dangers. Fun fact: the whole mirror-life thing is old news in science fiction, dating at least back to 1970’s Spock Must Die! by James Blish, later to be ripped off by Sheri Tepper’s Grass in 1989. • “International talks on curbing plastic pollution fail to reach agreement“. Oh, and in case you missed it: the multicorporate entity “Alliance to End Plastic Waste” generated 1,000 times more plastic waste than they cleaned up. November ’24 • So it turns out that the usual collection of assholes and shitstains did, in fact, manage to effect real change at COP29 after all: they deleted the bit about “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. Honestly, I don’t know why they even bothered. It’s not like those things are ever binding anyway. • 1.5° “deader than a doornail“. In other news, the Allieds storm the beaches of Normandy. • Ah, crap: the planet will continue to warms for centuries even after we hit net zero. Assuming we ever do. Tech specs here. • Oh, lookee here: Cop29 CEO filmed agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at climate summit. No big surprise, mind you. It’s not like this hasn’t happened before. • Biodiversity COP16 turns out to have been a total clusterfuck. Not that we were expecting anything different, given that he international community has never met a single fucking goal in this particular arena. October ’24 • Over a third of the world’s tree species currently in danger of extinction. • Currently on track for 2.6-3.1°C warming by century’s end. • Monkeypox has figured out how to spread via direct human-to-human contact, a step up from its original zoonotic mode of spreading. We’ve seen this before. Anyone remember Zika? • Risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapsing in the near term have been “greatly underestimated”. • A decent overview of the various and sundry corporations who’ve chosen to renege of their climate pledges. • Time to give up on direct-air carbon capture. It was always a fool’s errand anyway. 2.7°C, here we come. September ’24 • Everything tickety-boo! Nothing to see here! August ’24 • Current ground temperatures on Antarctica are on average 10°C higher than normal (whatever “normal” means these days). Up to 25°C higher, in some spots. July ’24 • This decade’s methane emissions—which have 80 times the heat-trapping power of CO2— have “far exceeded baseline projections” and are accelerating. In completely unrelated news, Kamala Harris has reneged on an earlier pledge and, if elected, will not ban fracking after all. • And now it’s Jasper’s turn to burn to the ground. By way of poetic justice, the Trans-Mountain pipeline just happens to pass through that burg.) • In unrelated news, last Sunday—July 21, 2024— was the hottest day on record, ever. Well, until Monday, anyway. • The next pandemic is expected to be “Bird Flu” again? What is this, a clip show? Where’s Nipah when you need it? Or even the Black death? May ’24 • Renewable energy in the US produced “$249 billion in climate and health benefits” from 2019 to 2022. PopSci coverage here. • Working paper (not yet peer reviewed) concludes that “macroeconomic damages from climate change are six times larger than previously thought“. A mere 1°C increase (which, mind you, we’ve already passed) leads to a 12% decline in world GDP. PopSci coverage here. If reality-based threats aren’t enough to get the politicians off their asses, maybe a threat to the global economy will. Not holding my breath, though. • Global ocean temperatures have been breaking historical records for a solid year now. • Leafhoppers devastating Argentinian crops. Winter frosts used to keep the insects in check, but, you know. • We’ve already spent a year above 1.5°C, but that’s nothing; 78% of surveyed IPCC scientists expect us to blow past 2.5°C by century’s end (current trends point to 2.7°C). “We live in an age of fools”, one scientist opines. • Biodiversity loss is biggest driver of disease outbreaks; climate change and invasive species also implicated. (Strangely, urbanization was a negative correlate. Which seems weird given the high-density thing…) • Annual jump in global CO2 levels hits new record. Blame El Nino. Sure. April ’24 • EPA mandates that US coal-fired plants have to put up or shut down. Okay. Conditional green. We’ll see if this survives the inevitable industry onslaught. • Climate change predicted to cost the global economy $38 trillion annually by midcentury, or six times what it would cost to keep warming to a merely-catastrophic 2°C. Of course, all those Exxon-Mobil CEOs will be long dead by then, so don’t expect anyone to move on this. • Arctic permafrost now a net carbon producer. • Globally, hottest March in History. That’s ten consecutive monthly world records broken. Remember when they were warning we might exceed 1.5°C as early as 2030? We already did that. For the past solid year. • The East Antarctic Plateau just hit 38.5°C above its seasonal average. In related news, emperor penguin colonies are collapsing. March ’24 • 2023 was 0.2°C higher than expected and no one knows why. (No, it wasn’t El Nino.) • Great Barrier Reef bleaching again. Fifth time in eight years, if anyone’s counting. • “Last Chance Tourism” is a thing now. “Quick, they’re going extinct! How can we make a buck off that?” • A good candidate for Least Surprising Development Of The Week: major banks abandoning the “bare minimum environmental standards” for fossil fuel development that they themselves invented. Not that those were in any way binding in the first place, of course. • It’s official: Avian Flu now in mainland Antarctica. (Previous cases were only confirmed among island populations south of the Circle.) February ’24 • First Human fatality from recently-discovered arctic Alaskapox virus (who readers may remember from my recent story “Contracting Iris“): also bubonic plague surfaces in Oregon. Cats implicated in both cases. Go cats! • North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation en route to catastrophic tipping point”: 1m Atlantic sea-level rise, Europe cools so fast that “no realistic adaptation measures can deal”. Significant uncertainty remains regarding when exactly the collapse will occur. Let’s just ignore that Nature paper that says it could happen as soon as 2025… • New “Category 6” hurricane proposed. Because hurricanes are way stronger now than they were in the old days. January ’24 • Air pollution from Alberta Tar Sands 1,900-6,300% higher than previously reported. Meaning the tar sands emit as much air pollution as all other Canadian sources combined. • Greenland losing thirty million tones of ice per hour, 20% more than previously thought. Another nail in AMOC‘s coffin. • Norwegian government approves deep-sea mining. I’ve spoken to a couple of Norwegian scientists who think this is a very bad idea. They have a lot of company. • We made it to 1.48°C in 2023! 0.17°C higher than last year, and we could break 1.5 in just a few months! Come on, you ecocidal shitstains! Let’s show those candy-ass coral reefs who’s boss! • Raptors on the African savanna in deep shit. 88% have declined over the past 40 years; 69% are in danger of extinction. • So, H5N1 is killing polar bears now. How very seasonal. What, did you think pandemics were only a human thing? 2023 November ’23 • COP28 lobbyists to present meat as ‘sustainable nutrition’. Because apparently, putting an oil company CEO in charge of the whole event wasn’t sufficiently farcical. • Earth just experienced the hottest year in recorded history, and probably within the past 125,000 years. A quarter of the global population exposed to “dangerous extreme heat events” for at least a 10-day period. They say next year’s going to be worse. • UK forests facing “catastrophic collapse” within 50 years. On the up side, that means they’ll outlast civilization itself by a good two decades. • Number of species in danger of extinction doubles to two million. Personally I bet that’s extremely conservative; we don’t even know how many species are out there in the first place. • World’s governments plan to produce more than twice the 1.5°C-limit for fossil fuels by 2030. Plus ca change. October ’23 • Avian flu makes it to Antarctica, after a massively successful South American Tour that killed “500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone”. Let’s see if they can top that down on Bird Island. • Another tipping point passed: looks like we’re losing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet no matter what we do; there’s “no significant difference between mid-range emissions scenarios and the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement.” Goodbye, coastal cities. PopSci coverage here. • Twenty one species removed from the Endangered species list because they’re, um, extinct. Well, that’s one way to clear the backlog. September ’23 • Swiss glaciers decline 10% by volume in two years. Measurement stopped on some glaciers because they’re, um, gone already. • OK, I’ll admit this is pretty cool: Water from portable desalinator potentially “cheaper than tap water”. Solar powered, fits in a suitcase, 4-6l/hr. • Senior oil executives providing “support” to COP28. Plus ca change… • 98% of Europeans breathing air that exceeds WHO pollution standards. Two-thirds of them are breathing air that’s over twice those standards. Not a green post because pollution is, you know, bad. But not a red one either, because the associated annual deaths of 400,000 of the world’s most cancerous pest species has gotta be some kind of silver lining, yes? • Nipah outbreak in India. When this bug goes global—and sooner or later, it will go global—it’s gonna make smallpox look like a head cold. • Antarctica warming “much faster than models predicted“, because of course it is. PoSci coverage here. • Hottest Summer Evar, by two-thirds of a degree. From the Dept. of Duh. • Tropical mosquitoes bring their disease-vectoring ways to Paris, en route to the Baltic. Right on schedule. August ’23 • Leader of religion that forbids birth control laments environmental destruction. Well, I suppose it’s easier than doing something about all kids they’ve raped and murdered. • Oh, and filed under “News So Unsurprising It’s Barely Even News”: July 2023 officially the hottest month ever recorded. A record that’ll probably stand for about thirty-one days. • Amazon leaders fail to commit to end deforestation by 2030. Something about not wanting to give up “extractive industries”. • Tick-borne deathly red-meat allergies may affect hundreds of thousands! That’s one way to cut back on meat consumption—and by the way, did I call it or what? Now, if only some feisty ecoterrorists could port that trait into mosquitoes and horseflies… • Irony of the week: Stricter controls on maritime pollution increase global heating. Seems all those airborne sulfates increased cloud reflectivity; now they’ve been reduced, more solar radiation gets through. • Ocean surface temperature now hotter than any time in recorded history, and still climbing. Parboiled fish floating belly-up off Florida. • Hey, everybody: leprosy’s back! (Just in Florida so far, but not for long: armadillos are leprosy reservoirs, and thanks to climate change those guys are already as far north as Nebraska.) July ’23 • The deep sea gets a one-year reprieve from mining. China finally backed down. • Antarctic sea ice at record low. • G20 countries fail to reach agreement on cutting fossil fuels again. Because, you know. Maybe it’s all just sunspots or something. • And July 4 was even worse. • July 3 was the hottest day the planet has known since we started keeping records. June ’23 • The nation of Tuvalu is uploading itself into the digital realm. Because its days are pretty clearly numbered in this one. • Climate change amped the odds of the current Texas heat wave by five times. On the up side, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving state. Except maybe Florida. • In case you were getting bored of humans changing the global climate, here’s something new: Humans are also changing the axial tilt of the planet by depleting groundwater reservoirs. • Oh, bother. Canada’s on fire again. • Ice-free summer Arctic ahead no matter what we do. Previous models, suggesting we might save the ice cap if we really cut back our emissions, underestimated ice loss. All together now: the optimists are always wrong, and the pessimists are too optimistic. May ’23 • Still on track to hit 1.5°C by 2027. Of course, if you only look at temperatures over land masses, we blew past that benchmark years ago. • Alberta—heart of the Canadian fossil fuel industry, home to the Athabasca Tar Sands, hotbed of climate-change denialism—is on fire. Gosh. Who could have seen this coming? April ’23 • World’s ocean surface temperature hits record high. After three years of La Niña tamping down on the cooker, it’s back to business as usual. • Increased flow of Antarctic meltwater compromising abyssal circulation. Deep ocean stagnates; shallow ecosystems starve for want of upwelled nutrients. • Canadian bank world’s biggest financier of global fossil fuel projects. It’s not like you can expect the federal government to chip in—they already gave more than $15 billion to the oil industry in 2022 alone… March ’23 • 8000-km swathe of sargassum weed headed for the Florida coastline. What’s not to like? Massive overgrowth, increased bioproductivity, increased CO2 absorption. The only thing it fucks up is Florida’s human population—and really, who deserves it more? • ‘Murrica’s “environmental president” approves 576m-barrel oil drilling project in Alaska, “potentially producing more than twice as many emissions than all renewable energy projects on public lands by 2030 would cut combined.” • Humans and their livestock now account for 98% of the planet’s terrestrial mammalian biomass. (When you include marine mammals we’re only at 94%, if you want to put a positive spin on things.) • New UN finalizes deal to protect (most) international waters. Although I might downgrade this to orange depending on what it ends up saying about deep-sea mining. • New GI-tract disease caused by plastics documented in seabirds. • The Guardian tries to put a happy face on the fact that emissions continued to rise in 2022 by saying at least they didn’t rise as much as they did the year before. February ’23 • Antarctic sea ice hits record low. In unrelated news, it’s 15°C today in Toronto. In the middle of February. • Wind and solar were EU’s top electricity source in 2022. Despite—or maybe because of—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. January ’23 • Now even neural nets are telling us that things are worse than we thought: 80% chance we hit 2°C by 2065 even assuming carbon neutrality. • World’s oceans hottest ever recorded in 2022. Absorbed about 10 zettajoules more heat than in 2021. • Current carbon offsets are bullshit. • Best-case (1.5°C) scenario: Half of all glaciers gone by 2100. Current trajectory: two thirds. December ’22 • COP15: Politicians desperate for some kind of win praise a non-binding biodiversity agreement with no enforcement, no accountability, and which doesn’t even mention commercial fishing or agriculture. (At least it can’t possibly do worse than its predecessor, which failed to meet a single one of its goals.) November ’22 • “None” now second-largest religious demographic in England and Wales. The US is still a fundamentalist nuthouse, of course, but you take your wins where you can find them. • Over 20K dead from this year’s heat waves in western Europe alone. (Although maybe this should be a green post. Surely fewer of us is a good thing?) • This year’s carbon emissions on track to be highest ever. Way to bend that curve, guys. • Previously-documented decline in human male fertility is accelerating! • Fossil fuel reps at COP27 up 25% over last year.”More than the combined delegations from the 10 most climate-impacted countries.” • Equipment designed to cut methane emissions is failing. • Past eight years hottest on record; each hotter than the one before. Follow the link if you want the ugly and consistent details about methane, CO2, arctic sea ice, glacier melt, and sea level rise. Bet you can guess the bottom line, though. October ’22 • No credible pathway to 1.5°C; currently on track for 2.8°C by 2100. Only hope is a radical and immediate transformation of global energy, food, and financial systems. Good luck with that. September ’22 • Christianity could well be a minority religion in the US within the next few decades. And it’s not other religions taking up the slack, either; the population is becoming increasingly nonreligious. This assumes that no massive social upheavals cause everyone to turn back to religion as a security blanket, mind you. Not necessarily a safe bet these days. • At least a third of Pakistan is underwater. August ’22 • All by itself, Greenland Ice Sheet decline will cause at least a 27cm rise in sea level no matter what we do now. “a very conservative rock-bottom minimum … Realistically, we will see this figure more than double within this century.” PopSci coverage here. • On the plus side, life expectancy in the U.S. continues to decline. Assuming anyone, you know, still trusts the CDC. • Australian wildfires are probably enlarging the Antarctic ozone hole. And I thought the ozone layer was the one thing we’d managed to put right. • Oh, great: polio’s back. • Apropos of nothing in particular, turns out even a teensy nuclear war could cause global famine. On the up side, a major war would cut the numbers of the world’s most pernicious pest species by more than half. • Okay, I’ll give you this one: the curiously-named “Inflation Reduction Act” at least gets the US off the sidelines and taking a first step. Even though it’s not nearly enough. Even though the cheerleaders seem to be breezing past the fact that the IRA makes offshore windfarm development contingent on an annual sacrifice of 60 million acres to the fossil fuel industry. At this point, you take what you can get. July ’22 • Democratic Republic of Congo opening vast tracts of forest (including gorilla habitat) to oil extraction. “Our priority is not to save the planet”, proclaims their government’s climate guy. Don’t sweat it, dude. It’s not anyone’s priority. • Monarch butterflies officially endangered. Kind of surprised it took them so long. • From Britain to China, record-breaking heat-waves, forest fires, and evacuations. “Not a very normal situation,” reads one quote from a Portuguese meteorologist. Yes it is, dudette. These days, it very much is. • US Supreme Court guts the EPA’s options for regulating carbon emissions. Because why just force people to have more babies when you can do that and increase the carbon bootyprints of each larva in the bargain? June ’22 • Desertification: Central Asian deserts have expanded by a hundred kilometers since the eighties. May ’22 • Exxon fails to wriggle out of going on trial for fucking over the planet and lying about it. This does absolutely nothing to mitigate climate change or to de-oil a single marine organism, but at least the odds of fucking up a few of the culprits may have improved a little. • You know those 50+°C heatwaves that are all the rage in India and Pakistan these days? A hundred times more likely now, thanks to climate change. Once every three years, instead of once every three centuries. • Pollution responsible for 1 out of every 6 deaths on the planet. That’s nine million a year. Put that together with the ongoing decline in Human fertility, this problem might just take care of itself. • It’s now basically a coin toss whether we blow through 1.5°C within the next five years. • 91% of the Great Barrier Reef bleached this year. And the year’s not over. • Fossil industry embarked on 646Gt worth of “carbon bombs“, more than enough to blow through the planet’s entire remaining carbon budget for a 1.5°C scenario. Then again, 1.5 was always a pipe dream anyway, right? And besides, there’s a war on. • Swapping out just 20% of global beef production for mycoprotein could, by midcentury, cut deforestation (and associated emissions) in half. April ’22 • Over 15,000 mammal-to-mammal zoonoses expected over the next half-century as a result of climate change. • A fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction. Popsci coverage here. • And of course, mere hours after the IPCC’s latest report emphasises yet again how we absolutely cannot afford to approve new fossil-fuel megaprojects, the Trudeau government approves a new fossil-fuel megaproject. They promise it won’t have any “significant adverse environmental effects”, though. Cross their hearts. • 1.5° is officially off the table. Now, the most optimistic scenario hinges on sucking carbon back out of the air to compensate for the inevitable “overshoot”. March ’22 • Great Barrier Reef bleaching yet again, during an El Nina this time (which is supposed to be when corals catch a break from the heat). “It’s also happening faster than was predicted 20 years ago.” • Coal surging, renewables stagnating, thanks to the war. I guess we can kiss goodbye even Cop26’s delusional and miniscule hopes of 1.5°C. On the up side, none of this matters in the event of a nuclear war. • 175 countries pledge to act on plastic pollution. It’s not a deal so much as a pledge to work out a deal, but at least it’s a legally-binding deal covering the the whole production cycle. Popsci coverage here. • Latest IPCC Report is out. “brutal“… “bleakest warning yet”… impacts “sooner and greater than we originally thought”… Ah, what’s the use. We’ve heard it all before, and we do fuck-all. February ’22 • U.S. Oil Industry Uses Ukraine Invasion to Push for More Drilling at Home. And less environmental regulation. And more pipelines. You know the list. • SW US megadrought now worst in at least 1,200 years. At least. • Global methane hits 1,900ppb. Been spiking since 2007. Arctic-thaw feedback suspected. January ’22 • Coal is in ascension again. All hail the post-covid economic recovery. • Ghost Flights are back. Up to 2.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emitted as empty planes fly around the skies of Europe. Didn’t we end this shit back in 2020? December ’21 • You know how the Arctic is warming “twice as fast” as the rest of the world? Turns out it’s actually warming twice as fast as that. So, four times. Yet another case of exceeding the worst-case scenario. November ’21 • The moral case for destroying fossil fuel infrastructure. About the only thing I’d disagree with is the claim that there’s no moral case for taking human life. Oh, and “Ethical” would have been a better word to use than “moral”. • In the wake of COP26, Biden administration selling off drilling rights to 80 million seabed acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Way to “lead by example”, you duplicitous scumbag. • Oh, here’s a cute little post-mortem tidbit from COP26: researchers were frequently prevented by the conference organizers from accessing the rooms where negotiations were taking place“. Kinda tells you all you need to know about how science factors into these things. • You may have heard that if every country honors the commitments made thus far at Glasgow, we could be looking at a merely disastrous increase of 1.8°C, instead of the downright catastrophic 2-plus.Wrong. Try 2.4°C. (PopSci coverage here.) • Hey, the grass roots finally accepts the reality of climate change! Of course, we’re still willing to do fuck-all about it. October ’21 • You know how we’re supposed to cut emissions in half by 2030? Current pledges, even if implemented, will only cut them by 17% according to the most recent UN Report (popsci coverage here). Yet another “thundering wake-up call”; so much for “building back better”. • 45% of Americans Don’t Believe Humans Cause Climate Change. Which probably still makes them smarter than Pyro650: at least most of them admit that climate change exists. • Fossil fuel industry gets subsidies of $11,000,000 a minute. Also, Biden signed as many drilling permits in the first six months of his administration as Trump did in his first year, during a time when no new drilling can occur past 2021 if we want to have a hope in hell of achieving even the flaccid half-assed commitments of the Paris Accord September ’21 • Coral reef coverage declined by 50% worldwide between the fifties and 2007. And that was before all those massive bleaching events hit the Great Barrier Reef. • Still on track for 3°C, thanks to virtually every Paris signatory not even coming close to meeting their commitments. (The only country that is on track? Gambia.) • Of course, they haven’t won a lot yet— and the moment they start, governments will probably just pass legislation to ban these kinds of lawsuits— but attribution studies are coming into their own when it comes to suing corps and countries for screwing the pooch on climate change. (Personally I’d like to see more in the way of jail terms and death penalties— but as usual, the good news is so far and few between you pretty much have to take what you can get.) August ’21 • Big Oil has a plan to deal with climate change. Basically, it’s suck up every drop of oil we can, for as long as we can, while getting governments and taxpayers to fund our ultimate and inevitable switch to renewables. • Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions are about to undergo the biggest jump since 1990, thanks to the post-covid economic ‘recovery’. Ah well. At least they’re learning to live with the whole catastrophic-flooding thing… • Hey, here’s a teensy glimmer of hope: coal-free steel. Note they didn’t say “carbon-neutral” steel, so I don’t know how “green” it is. Still. We take what we can get. • Down in the US, this passing Summer of the Furnace has changed people’s minds about climate change not at all. Hell, 1 in 4 don’t even think it’s any big deal. • Parts of the March ’22 IPCC report leaked seven months early by scientists fearing the usual governmental watering-down. How fucked are we? See for yourself. • Yup. We’re fucked even more unequivocally than we were the last time the IPCC checked in. Popsci coverage here. • Revenge Travel. It’s a thing. • Oh goodie. Looks like the Gulf Stream might be shutting down. Too many downstream effects to list here. • Last July worst for wildfires, globally, since records began. • The Greenland Ice Sheet lost enough meltwater to cover Florida to a depth of two inches last, um, Tuesday. 8.5 billion tonnes in one day. It’s not even a record. July ’21 • “Everything is on fire.” Siberia hit by unprecedented burning. • Remember “Limits to Growth”? Turns out they were right all along. Recent analysis suggests that business-as-usual will lead to global societal collapse around 2040, right on schedule. J. Industrial Ecol. report downloadable here. • Even now—even now— the G20 won’t agree on commitments to combat climate change. Four of the miserable fuckers have put forth plans that would lead to a 5C rise in global temperatures if everyone adopted them. • Not to be outdone by the Europeans catastrophic flooding also in China! All that coal-powered economic growth, finally paying off. • Tired of the same old stories about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires? You’re in luck! Climate change causes catastrophic flooding in Europe, too! Climate Change. A Catastrophe for Every Mood. • The Amazon rainforest is now a net carbon producer. Goodbye, “Lungs of the Planet”. It was nice knowing you. • June ’21 was the hottest ever recorded in the US. Wanna bet July breaks that record? • Last June’s inferno over on N’Am’s western reaches was rendered 150 times more likely due to climate change. • Hate to sound like a broken record but once again, worse than the worst-case scenario: Nobody saw the Lytton conflagration coming. Scientists never factored “heat domes” into their models. June ’21 • ExxonMobil lobbyists filmed saying oil giant’s support for carbon tax a PR ploy. ExxonMobil shocked and appalled by these allegations. May ’21 • Electric cars ‘will be cheaper to produce than fossil fuel vehicles by 2027’. One source even says this will happen by 2024. • Europe to clamp down on air and water pollution under green deal. “The overarching goal is to eliminate all harmful contamination by 2050.” Good words. Let’s hope the actions live up to them. • Heartened by so many governments suddenly hopping on the green bandwagon? Even if they all keep all their commitments, we’re still looking at a 2.4C global increase. Ah, well. 1.5C was always “aspirational” anyway… April ’21 • Australian Academy of Science: holding warming to 1.5C now “virtually impossible“. (As usual, the Hope Police object to the dire wording, but even they admit it’s “super-challenging” and “hanging in the balance”.) • Coal is powering the post-covid economic recovery. This year’s coal usage expected to rival peak burn of 2014. • European droughts over the past five years are “unprecedented in the past 2,110 years“. Popsci coverage in The Guardian. • Carbon emissions to soar in 2021 by second highest rate in history. Massive surges in coal power in the US and China. The Covid Dip. It was nice while it lasted. • Only 3% of the world’s ecosystems remain intact. We might be able to recover up to 20% through species reintroduction if we really get off our asses, but what are the odds? March ’21 • Disease outbreaks more likely in deforestation areas. Well, duh. • Bottom trawling releases as much carbon as air travel. Not to mention the sheer physical damage of clearcutting entire benthic ecosystems. Popsi coverage here. • Bladeless, even windless wind power. From giant wobbling dildos to streetlamp-mounted little turbines that harness air displaced by passing traffic. • Former CIO for sustainable investing at BlackRock states that “Green Investing” is Bullshit. Turns out capitalism is incompatible with decarbonization pretty much by definition. Who knew. • Geoengineering goes mainstream. At least, the National Academies of Sciences thinks we should be taking a serious look. • Falling sperm counts ‘threaten human survival’. It’s old news—and I remain skeptical that linear regression is the appropriate analysis in any case—but wouldn’t it be nice if our sperm counts really did hit zero by midcentury? And we’ve got no one to blame but ourselves. • Hey, new Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Actually it’s been going on since January, but who can keep track? (Also it now appears that Ebola can lie dormant in a host for up to 5 years, and then jump out and out break all over again…) • Northern California’s Kelp forest ecosystem reduced by 95% since 2013. Crash instigated by a “multiyear marine heat wave”. • UN agrees on standards to put a monetary value on ecosystems. Works great until Jeff Bezos pulls out his checkbook and says Okay, I’ve bought the Amazon. Let’s burn the fucker down.” • Global carbon emissions on track to surpass pre-Covid levels. December emissions 2% higher in 2020 than in 2019. Goodbye, Covid dip. You were nice while you lasted. February ’21 • Chance of keeping global warming below 2C currently 2%. Goodbye, coral reefs. • Nineteen out of twenty Australian ecosystems are seriously fucked (i.e., “experiencing potentially irreversible environmental changes.”) Guardian coverage here. • China doubles the number of “Protected” animal species. Now there’s, like, six of them. (Just kidding. Really, it’s nice to see they’ve given up on the whole wolf-extermination thing.) • Global “Peace Levels” have declined 2.5% since 2008. (Actually this dates from last August but I just discovered it now.) In your face, Stephen Pinker. • 20% of all Human mortality due to particulate air pollution. 30% in east Asia. Guardian coverage here. • US Cities are vastly underestimating their carbon emissions. The uncounted difference adds more annual emissions than the entire state of California. PopSci coverage here. January ’21 • Past estimates of sea-level rise are too conservative. The worst-case scenario gets even worse, yet again. PopSci coverage here. • Global ice loss now following IPCC’s worst-case trajectory. Which might be relatively good news, given how many indicators are trending to worse than worst-case. PopSci coverage here. • Electric cars will be cheaper than the fossil-powered variety by 2023-2025. Of course, fossil-powered SUV sales are still going through the roof. • Increased rewilding of landscape in rich countries, thanks to declining birth rates. See what happens if we just ignore that whole Judeo-Christian “fill up the world with thy numbers” edict? • Three quarters of the world’s sharks and rays are in danger of extinction. As usual, a conservative estimate. Popsci perspective here. • Electric car batteries with five-minute charging times produced. 1000 – 2500 recharge cycles without significant battery degradation. • Future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. “The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms—including humanity—is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts.” Popsci summary here. • World’s insects suffering ‘death by a thousand cuts’. A series of papers in PNAS. Popsci summary here. • Solar now cheapest electricity in history. Oil use still hasn’t peaked— and won’t without “stronger climate action”— but it’s something. • 2020 hottest year in recorded history. Technically tied with 2016, but 2016 cheated by getting an El Niño boost. December ’20 • Monarch butterflies are endangered under the ESA, but won’t get protection because ‘it costs too much’. Not the only such species, by a long shot. • Mass die-off of birds in south-western US ’caused by starvation’. One guess what the drought that caused the starvation was caused by. • Fighting the Covid recession by amping up fossil-fuel production. Imagine my surprise. • Global human-made mass now exceeds all living biomass. This doesn’t even include landfills. • Water now trading on the Stock Market. Hey, at least they haven’t monetized the air we breathe. Yet. • EU’s biggest oil producer closes deal to shut down its entire oil industry. Legally binding on future governments and everything. • November 202 hottest November on Record, beating out runners-up 2016 and 2019. During an El Nina no less, which acts to cool the planet. • By 2030, world’s governments plan to produce more than double the fossil fuels than would be consistent with curbing global warming. Meeting even the half-assed Paris accords requires cutting fossil fuel production by 6% annually. Current plans: an annual increase of 2%. • Media Reframes Projected Failure to Meet Carbon-Reduction Targets as Being ‘Within Striking Distance’ . If every country honors their pledges (which virtually none have done up to this point) we’re still looking at 2.1C increase by centuries’ end. But hey, let’s move the goalposts and call it a win. • Cloned Meat Goes Commercial. Only in Singapore, so far. And highly carbon-intensive until it scales up. But in a world in which 96% of mammalian biomass is people and livestock, it’s a start. November ’20 • Once covid passes, we plan on driving even more. We’re a bit more restrained when it comes to flying, at least. Be still my heart. October ’20 • A fifth of the world’s countries are in danger of ecosystem collapse. Odd. I didn’t realize that “ecosystems” respected international boundaries… • Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find. Preliminary findings. Still awaiting confirmation. But if true, another cascade has begun. • China pledges Carbon-neutrality by 2060. The bad news is, talk is cheap from the world’s biggest coal-burner. Good news is, totalitarian regimes can turn on a dime if they really want to. None of that messy pandering-to-the-voter bullshit. • Over half the Great Barrier Reef has disappeared since the nineties. As usual, this estimate is conservative; it doesn’t include major bleaching events over the past year. • California wildfires spawn first ‘gigafire’ in modern history. One fire, one-million-plus acres. • Climate change could tip 1.45 million km2 of Amazonian rainforest to savannah by century’s end. Admittedly a conservative estimate. Popsci coverage here. September ’20 • World fails to meet a single one of the UN’s 2010 Aichi biodiversity targets to put the brakes on global ecocide. Not a single fucking one. Report here. • Northern Hemisphere’s 2020 summer hottest in recorded history. • Global wildlife populations down by 68% since 1970. Two thirds down, one to go. August ’20 • Greenland Ice Sheet has passed Point of No Return. Already the largest single contributor to rising sea levels. Now there’s no Off switch. • Rising temperatures on track to kill as many people as all current infectious diseases combined. Original paywalled study here. July ’20 and earlier • Forget future development; emissions resulting from projects already committed/underway mean we can kiss 1.5°C goodbye as an attainable target. • Covid Means Fewer Children!. Even better, the fertility decline preferentially affects those with the biggest carbon bootprints (i.e., urbanites in rich countries). • 2020: the worst year ever for the fossil fuel industry. “We’re still in for a long and ugly fight”, they admit. Still. • Virtual extinction of Polar bears within eighty years due to climate change. But it’s not all bad. A few straggly survivors may be all Coca Cola needs to keep its advertising campaign within the bounds of good taste. • Green power beats fossil fuels for first time in Europe. Still less than half, and pandemic-temporary. But something. Also when there’s a renewables surplus they pay you to consume electricity. • Unsuitable for ‘human life to flourish’: Up to 3B will live in extreme heat by 2070. • Record-breaking Siberian winter keeps 2020 on track to be hottest year in recorded history. Covid Pause? What Covid pause? • It hit 80F in the Arctic this week. Not to mention the zombie fires. • 2019: the Hottest Year in Europe’s Recorded History. • Ecuador To Sell A Third Of Its Amazon Rainforest To Chinese Oil Companies. • Amazon could switch from carbon sink to carbon source within twenty years.. “Decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.” • The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing its third mass-bleaching event in five years.. Hey, just because nobody’s talking about it doesn’t mean it’s stopped happening. • E.P.A., Citing Coronavirus, Drastically Relaxes Rules for Polluters. But it’s okay, because they’re also asking companies to “act responsibly”. • Australian Bushfires destroyed over a fifth of the continent’s temperate broadleaf forests. This year alone. Who knows what next year might bring? • Global carbon emissions fall 2%. It’s pathetic progress and utterly insufficient, but I’ll take what I can get. • Australia’s Bushfires Completely Blasted Through the Models. They weren’t supposed to get this bad for another eighty years. • A quarter of climate-change tweets are from bots. The vast majority of them denialist. • January 2019 warmest in recorded history. • Good news for a change: Global emissions didn’t increase in 2019. • Climate change displaced 17.2 million from their homes in 2019. • Atmospheric triflouromethane—a greenhouse gas 12,000x worse than CO2— reaches record levels. • We’re currently adding 5 Hiroshima bombs worth of heat per second to the world’s oceans. And climbing. • Climate threats now dominate long-term risks. Global leaders finally admit risks outweigh those from cyberattacks, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and weapons of mass destruction. Well, duh. • Earth just had its hottest decade on record. NASA’s Gavin Schmidt admits 1.5C goal unattainable. • 2019 UN Emissions Gap Report (global emissions have to drop by 7.6% annually starting now or we’re even more fucked). • 3.2C unless emission-control efforts tripled. • Greenhouse gases accelerated to new peak in 2018. • Nature: Predicted extent of global flooding is triple previous estimates.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Zeke Miller, Associated Press Zeke Miller, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Leave your feedback RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background. WATCH: Trump delivers remarks at U.S.-Saudi investment forum Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. The two leaders then retreated to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides were served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun belts. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting. They later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments’ militaries, justice departments and cultural institutions. Additional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion. Prince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the U.S., but Trump teased $1 trillion would be even better. The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital — an exceptionally rare sight. Trump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers. As he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling. It was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-President Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom. Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. READ MORE: Trump will visit Gulf Arab states this week as pressing crises flare in Gaza and Iran But that dark moment appeared to be distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side. Later, the crown prince will fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince. Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77. Trump picked the kingdom for his first stop, because it has pledged to make big investments in the U.S., but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term. The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by Trump’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Trump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the U.S. from allies.

The administration this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets. But Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach. Before the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month U.S. airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route. The administration didn’t notify Israel — which the Houthis continue to target — of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries. READ MORE: Who is Edan Alexander, the Israeli-American hostage released by Hamas? In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing U.S. nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month. “Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.” William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit is remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Trump, meanwhile, hopes to restart his first-term effort to normalize relations between the Middle East’s major powers, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump’s Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. But Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalization it wants U.S. security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom’s nuclear program and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and the Israelis threatening to flatten and occupy Gaza. Prince Mohammed last week notably hosted Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh in Jeddah on the official’s first foreign visit since assuming office in April.

Title: Donald Trump signs economic agreement with Saudi Arabia

US president Donald Trump secured a $600 billion (€537 billion) commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States. Mr Trump, who was beginning a tour of the Gulf states, was greeted by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on defence, energy, mining and other areas. The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion (€127 billion), according to a White House fact sheet that called it “the largest defence co-operation agreement” Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defence companies in areas including air and missile defence, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said. “Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum,” the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a Saudi-US Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Mr Trump’s visit. “We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion,” he said. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. [ A ‘very nice gesture’: Trump accepts gift of new Air Force One plane from QatarOpens in new window ] Mr Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington’s priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. Mr Trump left Israel off his schedule, although he wants Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the 19-month-old Gaza war. Israel’s military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hizbullah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups’ leaders, have at the same time given Mr Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies. [ Trump’s direct hostage talks with Hamas signal his growing impatience with Israel’s Gaza warOpens in new window ] US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman over the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme. Mr Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails. Mr Trump told the investment forum he wants to offer Iran a new and better path towards a more helpful future. If no new nuclear deal is reached, he said, Tehran will face maximum pressure. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Mr Trump in his 2017-21 first term, under which Arab states including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel. Mr Trump said it was his “fervent hope” that Saudi Arabia would soon sign its own normalisation agreement with Israel, adding: “But you’ll do it in your own time.” Mr Netanyahu’s opposition to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters. Mr Trump also said he would order the lifting of sanctions on Syria at the behest of the crown prince, in a huge boost for interim Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa as he seeks to stabilise a country shattered by war. The US imposed sanctions on Syria during the rule of Bashar al-Assad, and had kept them in place since he was toppled from power in December after more than 13 years of war. The US president also said he would send secretary of state Marco Rubio to Istanbul for talks on the war in Ukraine on Thursday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he would attend only if Russian president Vladimir Putin – who suggested the talks – is also there. The Kremlin has yet to say whether Mr Putin will take part. Mr Trump is also sending Mr Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, three sources familiar with the plans said. Mr Kellogg earlier said that Mr Trump will show up in Istanbul if Mr Putin attends the talks. – Reuters © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

DONALD Trump has said he could go to Turkey to attend Russia-Ukraine peace talks - but says he is not sure if Vladimir Putin is going to come. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week proposed to hold direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday May 15 - but has since gone silent on his offer. Speaking today to reporters onboard Air Force One, Trump said: "[Putin] would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. "I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there. We’re going to find out. " He has said he may visit Turkey for the talks as part of his trip to the Middle East this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he is willing to go to Turkey but only if Putin was also there. The Kremlin has not yet responded if Putin plans to go to Turkey, but confirmed a delegation would visit Istanbul for peace talks. It comes after Trump met Syrian President and former al-Qaeda jihadi Ahmed al-Sharaa on day two of his Middle East tour. He said he would lift "criplling" sanctions that the Americans put on Syria 50 years ago - but demanded al-Sharaa to flush out foreign terrorists from the country to help US fight against jihadi ISIS. It marks the first meeting between the US and Syria in 25 years. Trump argued lifting the sanctions from Syria would give the country a "chance at greatness" after a century of brutal rule by the Assad family. Ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad fled his country after al-Sharaa's lightning rebel offensive in December, ending the 24-year regime and paving the way for a new government. Trump is currently in the Middle East as part of his first major tour since taking over the Oval Office. He is now in Qatar for a state visit. It comes one day after Don inked the biggest arms deal in history to supply Saudi Arabia with $142bn worth of weapons, the White House said. The sale is part of a landmark $600 billion deal with Jeddah that was signed after Trump landed in Riyadh to kickstart his Middle East tour on Tuesday. The President has also taken a shot at rival Iran in a marquee speech, saying the Islamic Republic needed to make up its mind about whether it wanted to chase developing a nuclear weapon and get war or choose peace and a trading relationship. It marks Trump's first state visit of his second administration, after Saudi Arabia was also the first state visit in 2016. Follow our live blog below for the latest updates: President Trump has been pictured greeting Kelly Ortberg - the chief of American manufacturing giant Boeing. Earlier, Trump announced that Qatar agreed to what he dubbed the "largest order of jets" in Boeing's history. Trump's right-hand man Marco Rubio has left the Trump team in Doha and is now bound to Turkey. The US secretary of state is to meet with Nato foreign ministers tomorrow in Antalya. Rubio is scheduled to travel on to Istanbul on Friday - where the US State Department says he will be in crunch talks with his counterparts on the Ukraine war. The US and Qatar signed an agreement to generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2trillion, the White House just revealed. Donald Trump has doubled down on his reason to accept a $400million aircraft as a gift from Qatar, calling the opportunity too valuable to refuse. While en route Qatar this morning for a state visit, Trump said to reporters onboard his Air Force One: "The plane that you’re on is almost 40 years old. “When you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it – this is like a totally different plane. "We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane.” The $400million jet could be the most expensive ever given by a foreign power to the United States - and will be used as his new Air Force One for much of his time in office. However, Trump's move to accept the palatial aircraft has raised a lot of eyebrows - including from his right-wing supporters like Ben Shapiro. While signing the deal, Trump compared the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said to the Emir: "We came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours. "You two guys get along so well and like each other, you remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. Both tall, handsome guys that happen to be very smart." President Trump and the Emir of Qatar have signed agreements to purchase aircraft from US Boeing. Qatar Airways had placed a "record" order for 160 planes from Boeing worth more than $200 billion. Trump said: "It's over $200 billion but 160 in terms of the jets. That's fantastic. So that's a record. "It's the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That's pretty good." Both parties have also agreed on a defence cooperation - inked by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth - which includes a statement of intent. A letter of offer and acceptance for MQ-9B drones was also signed. The US president was given an unusual motorcade as he arrived in Qatar on the next stop on his historic four-day visit to the Middle East. Donald Trump's car was escorted through Doha by bullet-proof Tesla Cybertrucks. Tesla is run by Elon Musk who joined US officials for Saudi talks on Tuesday. Donald Trump is due to sit down with Qatari officials soon to have lunch before completing a signing ceremony. It is unclear what the president is set to sign as just 24 hours ago he announced a historic deal with Saudi Arabia. Donald Trump is set to speak at a bilateral meeting with the Emir of Qatar at the Old Amiri Palace in Doha. Chairs are already lined up across the palace with officials - including Pete Hegseth and Scott Bessent - waiting for Trump. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani dubbed Donald Trump a "man of peace". "I know you want to bring peace to this region," he says. Trump then said he has been friends with the emir for a "long time". He added: "We have liked each other and we have worked with each other and now we can work in the highest capacity. "We have some very good news coming out of there today and maybe tomorrow or possibly Friday. But we will see about that." Trump today said he was still considering whether to attend talks on the war in Ukraine planned for Thursday in Turkey but he does not know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will go. "He'd like me to be there, and that's a possibility. ... I don't know that he would be there if I'm not there. We're going to find out," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Qatar. He has said he may visit Turkey for the talks as part of his trip to the Middle East this week. Russian president Vladimir Putin last week proposed to hold direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday May 15. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he is willing to go to Turkey but only if Putin was also there. The Kremlin has not yet responded if Putin plans to go to Turkey. Trump's Air Force One has landed at Hamad International Airport in Qatar. He will soon meet the country's leader Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani as part of his state visit. Donald Trump was seen boarding Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital Riyadh. He is going to fly to Qatar. We are working to bring you all the live updates. President Donald Trump told Gulf leaders that he urgently wants to make a deal with Iran to wind down its nuclear program, but that Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the region as part of any potential agreement. Trump said: "[Iran] must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons. "They cannot have a nuclear weapon." The US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month focused on Iran's nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly said he believes brokering a deal is possible, but that the window is closing. The president's strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen come as its proxy network has faced significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. In Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump's remarks "deceitful" but did not directly address the US leader's call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups. © NEWS ENTERPRISES, INC.

SAN JOSE — May 13, 2025 – Cisco today announced that it will collaborate with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), which is led by BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), MGX, Microsoft, NVIDIA and xAI. Cisco’s addition as a technology partner to AIP, alongside previously announced energy collaborations with GE Vernova and NextEra Energy, further strengthens the AIP platform as it seeks to invest in secure, efficient and scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads. AIP will initially seek to unlock $30 billion in capital from investors, asset owners, and corporations, which it in turn expects to mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing. Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO, Cisco, said, “AI is only as effective as the technology that connects and secures it. By collaborating across our industry and leveraging public and private partnerships, we intend to build the infrastructure necessary to fulfill the promise of AI as we work together to drive innovation and economic growth.” Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said, “On behalf of the partnership, we are thrilled to welcome Cisco, which will provide differentiated value to our ability to meet the evolving needs of AI infrastructure. The continued evolution of the AI ecosystem presents generational investment opportunities for our clients and partnership across technology, energy, and private capital will be critical to unlocking this growth.” Cisco joins the partnership with the belief that AI is set to be an economic multiplier, unlocking new ways of automating and augmenting the human workforce across all industries. The technology infrastructure needed to support this evolution requires hardware, software and security purpose-built for AI. The addition of Cisco reinforces AIP’s commitment to an open-architecture platform and fostering a broad ecosystem that supports a diverse range of partners on a non-exclusive basis, all working together to build a new kind of AI infrastructure.

Title: VeChain’s Sunny Lu Wants to Tokenize Sustainable 'Human Behavior' Like Driving a Tesla

When real-world assets (RWAs) finally became the crypto industry's narrative du jour, Sunny Lu, the founder and CEO of VeChain, could only smile. “I mean, we were doing this back in 2017,” Lu told CoinDesk in an interview ahead of Consensus 2025 in Toronto. “Back then, no one cared about RWAs." Back then—eons in crypto years—some of the projects VeChain was involved with were a dairy traceability project in China, working with Walmart China on food safety, and tokenizing carbon credits in 2018 with BYD as it was transforming from a regional car brand to an up-and-coming global giant. "We were ahead of our time,” Lu continued. VeChain defined a category that TradFi giants like BlackRock are now building into their brand. Now it's time for the protocol's next act. At Consensus Toronto, Lu will deliver a keynote titled “Real Decentralization for Mass Adoption,” outlining VeChain’s new approach to scaling RWAs and blockchain use beyond the crypto-native crowd. A roadmap that involves turning human behavior itself into a tokenizable asset and bridges crypto’s usability gap with AI agents and NFT-based staking. VeChain wants to turn everyday actions like recycling or driving an EV into something measurable and valuable on-chain. By linking real-world behavior to blockchain rewards through tools like VeBetterDAO and Tesla integrations, it’s creating a new class of tokenized assets, making sustainability measurable and incentivized on-chain. “We’re not just tokenizing big assets,” Lu said. “We’re tokenizing the invisible ones that didn’t have market value before.” Lu calls this “tokenizing human behavior,” a concept VeChain first explored in 2019 as a prototype through its partnership with BYD, where it tracked EV mileage to generate carbon credits. But real-world value doesn’t matter if people can’t access it. Crypto remains intimidating for most users, and Lu believes AI is the answer. VeChain is building an AI agent into its VeBetterDAO ecosystem, starting with a character named “BMO,” a virtual assistant that can guide users through staking, app interaction, and eventually optimize their token strategies across the VeChain network. “People don’t want to memorize seed phrases,” said Lu. “They want a Tesla login or a Google ID. They want to click a button and participate. Our AI agent will help them do exactly that.” VeChain’s upcoming integrations will allow users to log in with social credentials or even Tesla accounts. For example, EV charging data can flow automatically into smart contracts and generate carbon credit rewards without user intervention. “We’re removing friction from every part of the stack,” Lu said. “It’s like moving from Linux command line to macOS.” To enable broad protocol-level participation, VeChain is rethinking staking. Rather than requiring technical know-how or relying on centralized validators, users will soon be able to mint NFTs that represent their staked assets and delegate them directly to node operators. “You don’t have to give up custody,” Lu said. “Block rewards go directly from the protocol to you, no middleman. It’s more secure, more compliant, and easier for the average user.” This system, part of what Lu calls the VeChain Renaissance upgrade, aims to boost staking participation by lowering the technical barriers while preserving decentralization. “This is real decentralization,” Lu said. “Everyone else talks about it. We’re building it.” Lu’s keynote at Consensus in Toronto will mark a personal milestone: ten years since he first presented VeChain in New York back in 2015. This time, he’s coming with receipts and plans to showcase real traction from VeChain’s AI and sustainability initiatives. Mugshot, a DeFi app that rewards users for reusing their coffee mugs and not buying disposable cups, is approaching one million users. Another project, EVEarn, which integrates Tesla’s API to automatically convert EV charging data into on-chain rewards, boasts a 98% retention rate. “In Web3, that’s insane,” Lu said. “Almost every user keeps coming back every week. That tells you the experience is working.” For Lu, the future of crypto won’t be won by hype cycles or flashy tokens. It will be earned through usability. “The goal is mass adoption,” he said. “Real decentralization is the foundation. But adoption, that’s the destination.” Sam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

Asset manager VanEck launched its first tokenized fund, joining a roster of institutions entering the race to bring assets on-chain with tokenziation. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL), developed with tokenization specialist Securitize, offers on-chain access to short-term U.S. Treasury debt and is available on the Avalanche AVAX$25.17, BNB Chain BNB$653.15, Ethereum ETH$2,609.97 and Solana SOL$176.46 networks, according to a Tuesday press release. "By bringing U.S. Treasuries on-chain, we are providing investors with a secure, transparent, and liquid tool for cash management, further integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets,” Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at VanEck, said in a statement. "Tokenized funds like VBILL are enhancing market liquidity and efficiency, underscoring our commitment to providing value to our investors." VanEck, which also issues spot bitcoin BTC$103,484.08 and ether ETH$2,609.97 ETFs, follows the footsteps of BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other traditional finance firms launching tokenized products. Tokenization is the process of placing instruments like bonds, credit, commodities, real estate on blockchain rails in token form to achieve faster settlements, cheaper transactions and operational efficiencies. Tokenization of U.S. Treasuries, a traditional reserve asset, has been at the forefront of these efforts. It's a nearly $7 billion market now, growing over 500% over the past year, per RWA.xyz data. VBILL is accessible to qualified investors with a minimum investment of $100,000 on most blockchains, with $1 million minimum subscription on Ethereum. The fund’s assets are held by State Street and priced daily using data from RedStone’s oracle service. The token supports around-the clock onramp with Circle's USDC stablecoin. It also offers atomic liquidity with Agora's AUSD stablecoin, meaning that VBILL tokens can be redeemed for AUSD in a single transaction via smart contract. Agora is a stablecoin startup helmed by Nick van Eck, the grandson of the founder of VanEck. Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

Title: Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that’s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana’s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP’s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week’s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market—led by heavy hitters such as BlackRock—is still in charge. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider’s large gain can be equaled by several others’ losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Thomas Kresge Appointed CEO of Nomy Finance to Lead Launch of Asset-Backed DeFi Platform

May 13, 2025 08:39 ET | Source: Nomy Finance LTD Nomy Finance LTD HAMCHAKO MUTSAMUDU, Anjouan, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HAMCHAKO MUTSAMUDU, Anjouan - Nomy Finance has officially appointed Thomas Kresge as Chief Executive Officer, marking a pivotal moment in the company's evolution as it prepares to launch its asset-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Kresge, a former BlackRock strategist and MahrebGroup executive, steps into the role with a mission to bring institutional-grade transparency and economic rigor to Web3. His leadership comes just ahead of Nomy’s upcoming rollout of its NOMY token infrastructure, uniquely designed to mint tokens only against real assets while implementing a burn-to-scarcity model that redefines value in digital finance. In a world where legacy financial structures are gradually giving way to digital ecosystems, leaders who can think simultaneously like investors, strategists, and market architects are increasingly vital. One such figure is Thomas Kresge, the CEO of Nomy Finance. His story is more than just a professional trajectory — it’s a reflection of an era in which the lines between traditional assets and decentralized technologies are becoming blurred. Born in Linz, Austria, Thomas was raised in a culture of precision and discipline. Yet his ambitions extended far beyond local success. Moving to the United States to pursue higher education, he approached his studies not merely as a student, but as a researcher of new paradigms. New York University became his launchpad, where he not only studied finance but learned to interpret data as meaning, trends as signals, and economics as philosophy. His pursuit of depth led him to two MBAs — one from Harvard and another from Wharton — equipping him with a unique blend of management logic and investment intuition. A pivotal moment in his career came during his tenure at BlackRock in Asia. There, he encountered markets governed by their own volatile laws — where speed, risk, and innovation are tightly interwoven. Thomas learned how to build strategies atop unstable ground — and succeed. These capabilities made him the ideal candidate for MahrebGroup, which he joined in 2017 as Head of Strategic Development. His mission: to open new markets, forge international alliances, and launch initiatives in countries often overlooked due to uncertainty. But true recognition came in 2025, when MahrebGroup made a strategic investment in Nomy Finance. For Thomas, it was more than portfolio expansion — it was alignment with a philosophy. What drew him in was Nomy’s model, where the $NOMY token is minted only against real assets, and platform revenues are partially directed to token buybacks and burns. The concept — “asset-backed + burn-to-scarcity” — resonated with his own beliefs about what decentralized finance should become. In his words, transparency, economic logic, and a rejection of superficial marketing were the reasons he decided not just to support, but to lead and grow Nomy. “This is not just another blockchain startup. It’s a foundation on which the next generation of sustainable digital financial architecture can be built,” he stated in an interview. He approached Nomy not as a tech product but as an ecosystem. He built it around principles rarely seen in crypto: institutional transparency, user simplicity, capital protection, and legal resilience. Beyond the office, Thomas is a man of culture and analytical depth. His interests include behavioral economics, the history of investment bubbles, and architecture — quite literally, as he collects modernist building blueprints. He regularly speaks at global forums in Dubai, Hong Kong, and New York, advocating for responsibility in digital finance and sharing his vision of capitalism’s next chapter. In an age of noise, overheated tokens, and pseudo-innovation, Thomas Kresge stands out. He is not loud — he is methodical. He does not bet on hype — he bets on infrastructure. And perhaps it is precisely such leaders who will carry Web3 into maturity, rather than volatility.

May 13, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s MiB: Karin Risi, Vanguard’s Chief of Strategy & Product, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have an extra special guest, the Vanguard Groups, Karen Reese, the person who is responsible for so many initiatives, so much growth, so many new products, including the Vanguard RIA, the internal advisory service that runs $350 billion. This is a fascinating conversation if you’re at all interested in what it’s like to be part of a fast growing organization that is racking up trillions of dollars in assets, what it’s like to create new initiatives. Really, this is Tour de Force conversation. She has just concluded about 28 years at Vanguard and is moving over to Harbor Vest, which is the outside private equity shop that Vanguard has been working with. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with the Vanguard Group and Harbor Vests. Karen Reese, Karin Risi: Thanks for having me, Barry. I’m happy to be here. Barry Ritholtz: I’m happy to have you. I want to talk about your time at Vanguard, but before I do that, bachelor’s in finance, MBA from Villanova Finance always was the career plan. That’s what it kinda looks like. Karin Risi: Yes, I think it, it looks that way, but I, I’ll say I got more intentional over time, Barry, but no, I initially actually wanted to go to art school. Oh, really? A little known fact. Yes, Barry Ritholtz: I did. So from Villanova, you go straight into the MBA or do you work and then go back? Karin Risi: I worked for a few years at Sunoco in Center City, Philadelphia, and then I started my MBA there and then joined Vanguard and finished up my MBA in my first couple years at Vanguard. Barry Ritholtz: Really. So right from business school. And then the only company you’ve worked for since school is Vanguard. That’s, that’s an impressive run. How did you find your way to Vanguard Karin Risi: Like so many people at Vanguard? I had a friend that worked there, so I was a couple of years out of school in investor relations at Sunoco, and then I had a friend who said, you know, if you wanna get more into finance and investments, we have an opening at Vanguard. I think you’d really like it. And that truly is how I got into the interview process. I grew up in the area, I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, so I knew Vanguard Barry Ritholtz: Go Birds Karin Risi: Yes. But I didn’t know really that much about it. And I only had one friend who worked there, but I went for the interview process and, and joined as an investment analyst in 1997. So Barry Ritholtz: Late nineties. Vanguard had to be a really interesting place. What was it like during that period? Karin Risi: It was an interesting place. It was not, not an unknown, like many of my, you know, retired predecessors are, you know, when they joined Vanguard in the eighties, it was really off the radar. We were starting to gain traction. Indexing was starting to gain traction. The hiring classes were getting bigger. So I joined with, you know, dozens of other people when I joined Vanguard in May of 97. And you know, we were still though this small-ish firm in Malvern, Pennsylvania, valley Forge, Pennsylvania, very different from Wall Street. Barry Ritholtz: So if you joined Vanguard in 97, Jack Brennan is CEO, is that right? Karin Risi: That’s exactly right. Barry Ritholtz: He’s a delightful, serious individual. And I’m, I find him like every other prior CEO of Vanguard. Fascinating guy. Karin Risi: ] Yes, yes. And you’re right, a serious individual. Yes, Jack was leading the firm by the time I got there in 97. But of course, Jack Bogle was still sort of around his present on campus. You know, his whole spirit looms large even to today. Barry Ritholtz: And so I, if my memory serves, it was only a couple years later, Brennan kicked himself up to chairman and Bill McNabb comes in as CEO. So you worked with some really tremendous corporate leaders? Karin Risi: I did. In fact, if you think about the CEOs at Vanguard, I worked, I, I had a really special opportunity to work directly for Jack Brennan just for one year on a special assignment, working on scalable advice, which will figure later into my career trajectory. And then I worked directly for Bill McNabb, our next CEO. I worked for him in multiple capacities when he was running our institutional business. And then again, I worked for him directly as a member of the senior team when he was CEO. Similarly, Tim Buckley, our last CEO worked for him in multiple capacities. He ran our retail division and I was working for him at that time. And then I worked for him again when he took the CEO spot. Barry Ritholtz: So you mentioned Jack Bogle. Did you get to spend a lot of time with him? He is, St. Jack is pretty legendary. Karin Risi: He is legendary for sure. Not a lot of time. I never worked directly with Jack, but as I said, you know, I was working on the third floor of the Victory building, which is where Jack still had his office for a time, and then he moved down to the second floor. So he was very present on campus in my earliest years at Vanguard, but I did not work with him directly. Barry Ritholtz: you were head of strategy, product marketing, communications, like is that one job, is that four jobs? Tell us a little bit about your progression over 27 years through the leadership ranks at Vanguard. Karin Risi: Yeah, it’s that what you just described was my final post at Vanguard and, and it, it was, yeah, kind of like four jobs, but it was one, one assignment. Throughout the 27 years though, I had, as you know, a bunch of different roles at Vanguard. Really strong rotational culture at the firm. So I joined in the corporate division as an investment analyst. Then I moved to corporate strategy, then I moved and I did a, probably a five year stint in a couple of different roles in our institutional division. And then I spent probably a dozen years in our retail division, whereas you mentioned I ran the, ultimately I ran the division, but I started in different roles in the division, particularly leading the advisory group before taking over. And then my final post before I retired at the end of last year was, as you mentioned, strategy marketing, global investment, product development, oversight of all of our external managers, and then also corporate communications. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let’s, let’s put some flesh on the bones. When I hear corporate communications, I think investor relations, public relations, just, and, and for, it’s kind of interesting for most of Vanguard’s history, not a very aggressively public firm, kind of a low key firm. Not that Jack was low key, but the firm itself wasn’t doing the usual rounds, isn’t out there yelling and jumping up and down with their hair on fire, just very quietly, at least from my observation. Tell me if I’m wrong. Karin Risi: No, I think that’s a fair characterization. Jack Bogle certainly was out in the industry and vocal, but at the firm level, you’re right, we didn’t do a lot of advertising. We, you know, we were quite happy to be in Malvin, Pennsylvania and sort of out of the limelight. That was intentional on our part, especially in the earlier years. I think over time we’ve gotten far more comfortable taking a stand and expressing our point of view. But by and large, your characterization is, is fair. The corporate communications function at Vanguard today, you know, has evolved considerably from back in the early days. We now have a crisis communications function, a certainly a well-developed and global PR function, as well as all of the standard sort of corporate messaging and, and things that you would see on our digital properties. Karin Risi: Product development, that’s such an ambiguous phrase. Tell us what product development means specifically at Vanguard. Karin Risi: Of course, for Vanguard it means investment product development. So I had oversight of our 420 plus the number’s probably even greater now, first mutual funds and increasingly ETFs. And we do, as you know, all of our passively managed products or our managed in-house by our investment management group. But our actively managed funds or active equity funds, I should say, we do active, fixed in- house, but our active equity funds are sub-advised to a stable of investment advisors. And I had purview over that. My teams identified and then oversaw and, and built the relationships with each of those external advisors. Firms like Wellington, prime Cap, et cetera. 00:08:27 [Speaker Changed] And, and a lot of people don’t realize because, you know, Vanguard and BlackRock are synonymous with broad indexing, but am I getting the numbers right? About 25% on the equity side is active? Or is it even higher than that? 00:08:41 [Speaker Changed] It’s about probably just shy of a trillion dollars in active equity. 00:08:46 [Speaker Changed] That’s real money. Yeah. Yeah, 00:08:47 [Speaker Changed] It’s real 00:08:47 [Speaker Changed] Money. How many sub-advisors are you working with and what is that process like? 00:08:52 [Speaker Changed] Well, today I think the number, it fluctuates a bit as we add managers to the stable and part ways with some others. But I think the high watermark was probably in the mid twenties. It’s probably down to 22 or 23 now. You have to check with the team. But when I left, I think it was about 22 or 23 different managers. And given the design of the product and the client need, we’re trying to meet, we look for the best possible active manager to fill that mandate. 00:09:16 [Speaker Changed] So I’m didn’t realize until you just said this earlier, all of the active fixed income is in-house, but the active equity is external. What’s the difference between the two for our audience? I think I have an idea of the difference in terms of active fixed income has certain attributes that active equity doesn’t, but I want to hear it from you. 00:09:40 [Speaker Changed] Well, and and maybe one minor clarification. Vast majority of our active fixed income is managed in house. Wellington does manage one or two active mandates for us, still legacy mandates like Jennie Mae, et cetera. But really the difference being Vanguard chooses to manage funds in-house where we have the talent and expertise to do so, and active fixed income. Our, our bond desk is tremendously deep in talent. Greg Davis, who I know you’ve had on the show before, he’s great. Yes, he is. He and his team have, you know, built out our fixed income capabilities over the years. And so we really are in a strong position to offer active fixed income across the range. And I think you’ll see Vanguard leaning into our fixed income product line up even more going forward 00:10:24 [Speaker Changed] At risk of oversimplifying this, it always feels like active fixed income. You can run a screen and screen out riskier product, riskier bonds, lower quality bonds, and that immediately accrues to outperformance for an active bond portfolio. You could develop screens to select certain quality bonds that you have certain return characteristics that you like. Am I wrong? And I, I always feel like I’m making, I’m dumbing it down too much. It feels like you can do more on the fixed income side actively and generate a return for your effort, whereas it’s so much harder to do that on the equity side. 00:11:09 [Speaker Changed] I think that’s fair. And I think Sarah Devereux, who runs our fixed income shop at Vanguard now would agree with you. I think there’s a lot of opportunity that the team sees based on what’s happening in the environment. And, and perhaps I, I don’t know, I’m not in a position to say relative to active equity. I dunno if our active equity managers would agree, but, but I know that Sarah’s team would agree. 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] You mentioned that Vanguard is headquartered in Malvern, that it was a purposeful decision not to locate and headquarters in Boston or New York City. What are the advantages that, how does that accrue to the culture? 00:11:43 [Speaker Changed] I do think it plays a big role in our culture, especially over decades. I think it’s a big part of, in some ways, the talent we attract. There is a, a very purposeful decision on the part of most people in our industry to, in many cases relocate their family to the suburbs of Philadelphia. Many of them are coming from New York or other areas. And you have to really buy into the mission and purpose of Vanguard and its company and its culture to, you know, make a consequential decision like that. And, and I think it, it speaks to the ability for our mission and purpose to resonate with top talent in the industry. 00:12:20 [Speaker Changed] And to be fair, Philadelphia is a great American 00:12:23 [Speaker Changed] City. I agree. 00:12:24 [Speaker Changed] I agree. Every time I’ve ever gone to Vanguard, I’ve always arranged a weekend in Philly. It’s always a blast. The food is great, the history is great. It’s not like nothing is New York, but I would put Philly in Boston, you know, absolutely on par in terms of, hey, we have this great city right here. 00:12:43 [Speaker Changed] I would agree with you, Barry. And, and I think for a, for a Vanguard culture perspective, it also allowed us to really instill in, you know, now 20,000 crew around the globe. But those of us in Melbourne for sure, this notion that our culture is really reflection more of Main Street than Wall Street. You kind of hear that around Vanguard every now and then. And it speaks to the clients that we serve and the way we think about product development and, and all of the rest of it. 00:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. So I mentioned Vanguard is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary by the time this airs, its already have happened. That’s right. That’s a 1974 was when it was launched. That’s an amazing run. 50 years. What does that mean to affirm the size of Vanguard? 00:13:27 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I think it’s a, you know, an important milestone, but it, it is a reflection of everything that Vanguard has been over the last 50 years. I think, you know, our, our culture, our mission, our purpose has been incredibly consistent from the top down, you know, modeled by every leader. You mentioned the CEOs of Vanguard that you have already had the pleasure of talking to. Gotta 00:13:49 [Speaker Changed] Get the new guy in here. 00:13:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, you gotta get the new guy in. But you know, there is just a remarkable consistency across what we try to do for clients and, and how our leaders express that and how our crew, you know, feel that and, and reflect that to our clients when they serve them every day. 00:14:04 [Speaker Changed] So I’m gonna share a Bill McNabb story, which I’m sure you experienced, and I want to just get your reaction to it. He told the story here during the financial crisis. He would occasionally plug into the phone system and listened to advisors speaking to clients. And not only were the clients freaked out, but you could hear people on the phone, they were a little nervous, all hands on deck, phone call, Hey, listen, we’re gonna come through this better than ever. Nobody’s getting fired, nobody’s getting laid off. Take a deep breath, go do your jobs, and suddenly everybody is just, you know, running on all cylinders. What was your experience during the financial crisis with McNabb at the helm? 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] Very similar to what you just described and, and very consistent with how Vanguard approaches crisis, really. I mean the, the GFC was definitely qualified as a crisis for our firm and the industry and investors. And there was a, a calmness coming from Bill as the CEO, but also the rest of the leadership team and providing assurance to our crew. And you’re right, there was, you know, an explicit assurance that we were going to keep calm and carry on, and really importantly, continue investing in our strategic priorities where, you know, some firms were immediately pulling back after the GFC Vanguard had the luxury of, you know, we are playing a long game and continuing, I recall Bill and the leadership team expressing to our crew at the time, we’re gonna continue to invest in our strategic priorities, we’re leaning in. 00:15:38 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, 00:15:38 [Speaker Changed] Really. And I think it had a very big calming effect on the crew. 00:15:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s how he told it. And, and I I’m not surprised that at your reaction, he, I mentioned Jack Brennan, bill McNabb, another rock steady guy that’s whose hand you on, on the tiller. You know, this guy isn’t gonna be rattled by a market sell off or a crisis. And that’s, that’s really fascinating. My colleague Eric Unis wrote a column called the Vanguard Effect way back in 2016. And at the time he ran the numbers and said, Vanguard’s low fee approach has saved investors either directly or through indirect fee pressure, a trillion dollars. That was almost 10 years ago. I think we could ballpark it closer to $2 trillion. Tell us about the focus on cost and how that’s impacted investors and the entire industry. 00:16:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I’m, I’m not gonna check your math on that, but I’ll, I’ll buy Eric saying your, your estimate there on what we’ve saved investors over time. And I think the focus on cost has been relentless. It’s something that is in the fabric of the organization. We counsel our investors and our clients to focus on the things they can control. And, you know, expense ratios, whether it’s mutual funds or ETFs, these are things that are within an investor’s control and it helps them keep more of their return. It’s part of our whole, you know, portfolio construction methodology. When we advise clients, it’s one of the factors, not the only factor, and maybe not even the first factor Barry, but certainly keeping costs low is something that Vanguard feels obligated to do for, its now 50 plus million investors around the world. Wow. And the Vanguard effect to use Eric’s, you know, phrase is real. I mean, we, we have seen that, particularly when we enter new markets outside the us 00:17:30 [Speaker Changed] You see, you see fee compression immediately when Vanguard shakes everybody’s cage. Yes. So, so it’s funny ’cause Eric eventually writes a book, the Boggle Effect, you mentioned cost isn’t the first principle. I kind of get the sense then of the things that you can control, its being a long-term investor and being a buy and hold investor. That wasn’t popular when Vanguard launched in 1974, was 00:17:59 [Speaker Changed] It? No, sometimes it’s still not even popular today. But we’ve been pretty clear and, and steadfast in our view that investors should have a goal, they should be intentional about what they’re trying to achieve. Having some balance and diversification, being thoughtful about how you construct a portfolio and, and perhaps getting the help of an advisor to do that, if an investor would benefit from that. And really having the discipline to your point of sticking with it for the long term and understanding what, what your personal risk tolerance is, your investment time horizon, and really thinking about how you’re going to achieve those goals. 00:18:34 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna ask you a question, and I’m very cognizant of the fact that you are no longer with Vanguard. We’ll talk a little bit about where you’ve went. There has been in the industry as a whole, but surprisingly at Vanguard, also a move towards some privates, some alternatives. Tell us about this evolution. 00:18:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s an exciting one both for the industry but also for Vanguard. As you mentioned, we began offering in 2020. I think we began offering a private equity fund to some of our retail investors. Those that were qualified for it. It was a first for Vanguard. But I would say the notion of broadening access to different types of investments for mainstream investors is not a first. I mean, it’s what we did with mutual funds, it’s what we did with ETFs, it’s what we endeavored to do with advice. And so private equity is part and parcel really of that advice offer for many of our advice clients. I think you’ll see a lot more of that. In fact, there was, subsequent to my leaving, there was a recent announcement that there is even another product that there’ll be more information on with partnering with Blackstone and Wellington, which is pretty exciting. 00:19:52 [Speaker Changed] And where did you end up shifting after 27 years? 00:19:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m still making the shift, you know, I’m still kind of writing my next chapter, which is really, really exciting. But I will be joining Harbor Vest Partners board next month. 00:20:06 [Speaker Changed] So May 1st you’re at Harbor Vest. Vanguard did a, I wanna say a experiment which they’ve expanded, which was working with Harbor Vest, which, you know, maybe the lay person knows Vanguard, but they don’t know Harbor Vest. They’re one of the biggest private equity and private credit shops out there. Right. Tell us, what are you doing at Harbor Vest? 00:20:27 [Speaker Changed] Really excited to join Harbor Vest in May. I’m gonna be joining their board, really getting to know the firm in a different capacity. When I was at Vanguard, of course, in 2020, we partnered with Harbor vests. I oversaw the team that actually selected Harbor vests among multiple managers that we considered for our first private equity offer for both retail and OCIO clients at the time. So multiple series or vintages of that fund have progressed and Vanguard continues to work with Harbor Vest and now I’m looking forward to working with them in a different capacity. 00:20:59 [Speaker Changed] So, so this raises a fascinating question. There has been a giant shift from public to private assets over the past, you know, certainly decade or so. Not everybody can be in the top 10% as, as the joke goes, but it seems like there’s almost a land grab going on for the retail investor thinking about a traditional 60 40 portfolio. Why should they also be thinking about adding a slug of private debt or private equity to their portfolio? 00:21:32 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s one of the, the next things that we, as an industry, not just Vanguard, but more broadly advisors have to help clients with retail clients in particular, who are used to, as you said, a conventional 60 40 public portfolio. Really thinking about is first is there a role for privates in their portfolio construction? And then if yes, if appropriate, then how they should integrate that into their portfolio and then which manager they should do that with. So it is a, you know, a multi-layered decision process. And I think one that advisors can really help with. That’s a personal opinion. I think advisors can help clients who maybe know a little bit about private equity, but not enough or have heard about private credit and all of the, you know, press headlines that private credit is getting right now and really trying to figure out, is this right for me and, and in fact can it generate excess returns well above public markets over time? 00:22:29 And is that something I should incorporate into my portfolio? I think that’s a, you know, a problem statement that many clients aren’t even approaching yet, but, but perhaps should, perhaps there is a spot for, and I think if you look at all of you, you called it a land grab, I think that’s pretty fair. I think there’s a ton of movement. Sure. Every, everybody I speak with, and probably those that you speak with too, are talking about democratizing privates. I think it’s a, a trend right now, but I think in general it’s something that should be here to stay. 00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] So, so let me ask you two questions about that. An easy question and a hard question. The easy question is, Hey, is this about non-correlated diversified returns or is this about generating alpha and outperforming markets public markets? 00:23:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it can be both. I, it’s a really good distinction. I think it can be both. It depends on your wealth level, it depends on how much of your overall allocation you’re going to put into privates, and then what type of private market asset class you’re gonna be working with. So yes, I think it can be a, an uncorrelated return opportunity and also an alpha generation opportunity. 00:23:36 [Speaker Changed] So now the hard question, Vanguard built its reputation on low cost alternatives, have a reputation of, of being pricey. So how do you square that circle? 00:23:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it’s going to be a matter of you pay different things for different asset classes and private market investing is different than public market investing. So I would imagine that investors should expect to pay more for a private equity offer or private credit offer. The key for me, you know, and again, speaking personally would be, I wanna know that I’m getting a top quality manager at a fair price. I think, you know, giving a fair price is the obligation that the industry has to investors 00:24:17 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and that’s the Vanguard culture even spilling over into private. So we’ve come to know Vanguard, not just for passive, not just for indexing, not just for stocks and bonds, but generally a putting clients first, the fiduciary approach to asset management. Is that consistent with some of the criticism we’ve seen of the alternative space? Or is it simply as much as not all alternatives are created equally? 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] Certainly not all alternatives are created equally. I think you could say that for sure. And I think with regard to what Vanguard endeavors to do, it’ll be up to the current CEO and his leadership team. But I would suspect that they will stay true to the notion of trying to provide clients with the best possible offers that meet their long-term investing needs. And I do think that there is a place for private assets in that, but that’ll be up to the current team to decide. 00:25:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really fascinating. So I read a crazy stat that in the state of Pennsylvania, if you are a certified financial planner, 93% odds that you work for Vanguard is, can that possibly be correct? 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Again, I’m not gonna check your stat, but I I think yes, having built out the personal advisor offer from the ground up and, you know, passed it on to multiple of my colleagues since then, we’re now well over I think a thousand advisors for sure. Wow. So it’s possible. Luckily we have other domestic offices, not just Pennsylvania. There’s also Charlotte and Arizona and Dallas. So we can, we can attract talent in the CFP ranks from multiple 00:25:59 [Speaker Changed] Spots. So, so I have to ask you, you are working at this giant shop and you say, I know, let’s build an RIAA registered investment advisory firm that’s a fiduciary within a giant asset manager. Tell us about the genesis of this. 00:26:16 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well, definitely not my vision alone. Okay. There was a, it was a firm wide kind of push for sure. We had been, this is going way back, we had been chasing scalable advice for decades at Vanguard. We had an offer very small relative to, you know, the firm size at the time it was called asset Management services. The minimum was $500,000 to invest. You got a one-on-one dedicated advisor, much the same way you do today. And I think we charged back then, Barry, probably 90 basis points on the first million. Okay. 00:26:51 Great offer. Clients loved it. High NPS scores, but certainly not scalable. You know, we had a few hundred fewer than 200 advisors really powering that offer and, you know, fewer than 10,000 clients. So we knew that we had the ability to offer great advice using mostly Vanguard product at the core of the advice methodology at the time. And we wanted to scale it. But I credit really Jack Brennan initially for wanting that scalable advice. I, I mentioned at the top of the program that I had a special opportunity to work for Jack doing research, really kind of pulling together research and helping the senior team determine whether they were going to try to do this scalable advice offer. And there were multiple iterations before personal advisor, personal advisor, which we launched in 2015. That’s the offer you just referenced. Well over 350 billion now, serving hundreds of thousands of clients. It started with multiple iterations inside of Vanguard. So I think we, we had a couple of goes at it before we perfected what I had the really the privilege to lead in 2015. 00:28:02 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That, that’s really fascinating. I know Vanguard has a direct indexing product now. It’s kind of fascinating to look at all these different product lines and divisions. ’cause in the early days, Jack Bogle didn’t wanna do ETFs, didn’t wanna do international, Hey, we do one thing, we do it really well, and everybody else can, can play catch up 00:28:25 [Speaker Changed] And you can add advice to that list. He didn’t, he didn’t wanna do advice either really in Oh, for sure. We had thousands of frontline phone associates who were told do not use the word advice. You know, there was a definitely a very clear line between guidance and advice, and we were very careful to step back from the advice line, if you will. 00:28:43 [Speaker Changed] What, so what’s the difference between guidance and advice? 00:28:48 [Speaker Changed] Well, there is a regulatory difference for sure. And that’s, that’s what we were homing in on at the time. But 00:28:53 [Speaker Changed] I, but you, you have discretion, right? Yes. Your fiduciaries. Yes. So I don’t see the difference. Think it’s, listen, if you’re giving your child advice or you’re giving them guidance, maybe guidance is a little gentler. Yes. 00:29:08 [Speaker Changed] Guidance is gentler. It’s, it’s, there is definitely a difference. But, you know, I had in, in, earlier in my career, I led phone groups, you know, hundreds of phone associates and we would train them to serve the clients transactional needs and help them with guidance. But I cannot tell you in the same way that Bill McNabb would monitor phone calls, I would monitor phone calls when I was leading those groups. And so many clients just wanted to know which funds should I buy? And that was, what do you, you know, that was, you say, had a small stable of funds. Right? And now we have, you know, 400 different options. And I think it, it also led to the genesis of our personal advisor offer because we realized there was an incredible pent up demand. Sure. People who had joined Vanguard, you know, perhaps with a, a single mutual fund, you know, maybe they started with a money market fund or maybe 00:29:59 [Speaker Changed] So totally self-directed. 00:30:01 [Speaker Changed] Totally self-directed is really the legacy of the firm. You know, we still have a, a much greater cadre of, of self-directed clients than advised clients. 00:30:09 [Speaker Changed] The vast majority of assets, 00:30:10 [Speaker Changed] Vast majority, vast majority of clients. 00:30:13 [Speaker Changed] Although I say this as an RIA, I know the RIA side of the industry are big buyers and supporters of Vanguard products. 00:30:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, for sure. I mean, I would acknowledge that the RIA channel for sure is, it’s a totally different division at Vanguard, but it is absolutely critical to our success and growth over time. What we’ve been talking about is really that direct relationship when a, a client, you know, opens a, a mutual fund account directly with Vanguard. And then that is essentially what, what I’m referring to as self-directed. But in the same timeframe, we were growing our financial advisor services division as well. And that is a critical component of what we do today. 00:30:53 [Speaker Changed] And, and when this first rolled out, there was a little rumbling, I think Vanguard managed to thread the needle and say, we’re not offering advice, we’re offering guidance, and not exactly competing with that channel. 00:31:06 [Speaker Changed] Well, we were offering advice, but you’re right that, you know, there was a little bit of needle threading to do. I think partially we were able to do that well because there was so much internal collaboration across the senior leaders at the firm. First Martha King, and then Tom Rola ran the FAS division at that time. And when Tom took over, I was running the retail division and there was a lot of discussion around, you know, what we needed to do to both serve RIAs really well through Tom’s division and also be a growing and thriving R-I-R-I-A ourselves serving individual investors with our own advice methodology. And I think there’s been a lot of collaboration between those divisions over time where we use research and the things that we learn through our investment strategy group or our, our in-house research. We share that with the RIAs that we serve. 00:32:00 [Speaker Changed] So here’s a crazy stat I wanna throw out at you. So, total investible assets of stocks, bonds we’re not quite a hundred trillion, but we’re, it’s not that far off in the United States. How is it possible that nobody in the RIA space has market share? You guys are $350 billion and it’s like, eh, 00:32:21 [Speaker Changed] Well there are some pretty big and, and very strong independent RIAs and we serve a lot of them. They’re clients of Vanguard’s. But you’re right, it’s a, it’s a fragmented market still there. There’s definitely a top tier for sure. 00:32:33 [Speaker Changed] Alright. But there’s 10 Yeah. Firms with Yes, you’re right. A hundred billion, 200 billion and a ton of firms with 20, 40, 60 billion. And I, it’s funny, when I discuss these numbers with family, they think 5 billion is a lot of money. I’m like, oh no, no, we’re, we’re peons. They, they don’t really, they don’t really know what, what trillions are, but why is the industry so fragmented? 00:32:55 [Speaker Changed] You know, I don’t know what the why is behind that, but I can certainly say just in the time that I’ve left Vanguard, all of the conversations I’ve had around the industry, there is a ton of interest in, and you see it yourself, all of the consolidation that is happening among all of those mid and smaller tier RIAs, you know, the larger firms, the, the, the top tier or are either buying up those RIAs, there’s consolidation across the industry. There’s a lot of private equity money invested and investing interested in investing more in the RIA space. There’s just a ton of movement in wealth management, which I think is exciting and hopefully is good for investors. 00:33:29 [Speaker Changed] And there’s some crazy number, the average advisors age is like 66. So there’s a whole succession planning. Yeah, that’s the other 00:33:36 [Speaker Changed] Thing. You’re right, the demographics, it’s, you know, lots of RIAs are, you know, looking to turn over their book and they don’t have a strong succession plan. 00:33:44 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That, that’s really fascinating. So one of the things you launched at Vanguard, there’s so many different initiatives you did, but the Vanguard Women’s Initiative for Leadership Success. Tell us a little bit about that. What led to this project and, and what have the results been? 00:34:01 [Speaker Changed] They call it Wills internally at Vanguard. And you’re right, it’s the Women’s Initiative for Leadership Success. It was spearheaded under Bill McNat leadership. And I mention that because it is so important that top down the CEO made it a priority. And I think that’s why it continues to thrive today. I had the honor of being one of the founding leaders of our Wills initiative more than 15 years ago at this point. But it’s still an incredibly important employee resource group within the firm. And it was the first of, of several. So we probably have half a dozen or more different employee resource groups now, but the importance of encouraging women and helping them develop into leaders at Vanguard, and I, I use the term leader broadly, so leader of people, but also specialists in portfolio management or legal or you know, data analytics, you name it. So there’s just been a lot of evolution over time, but that consistent drumbeat of helping our women develop into the, you know, highest potential leaders that they could be at the firm in whatever area of expertise they were best suited to. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] What sort of advice would you give to a young woman aspiring to a leadership role in the world of investing in finance? 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] If I think particularly about the advice and counsel that I have given to many younger women in the organization, I often will say, don’t be afraid to take a risk. You know, do the work, develop a point of view. Have your own point of view, and be willing to share it. That’s, you know, there’s often a confidence gap. It’s not an, an aptitude gap, but 00:35:35 [Speaker Changed] Men blunder in regardless of their competency. Women are much more circumspect, pardon me for mansplaining sexism, but, but like my observations have been, man, I as a, as a dude, I, I’m out over my skis. I have no radio training. What am I doing here? And I’ve noticed since I’ve been doing this that men just seem to be, we are blythe idiots stumbling into things and women seem to be more thoughtful in circumspect. 00:36:08 [Speaker Changed] Those are your words. So I’ll, I’ll just say yes. I find many times men are infinitely comfortable sharing their point of view regardless. Yes. But I think women can often use some encouragement to, you know, one, one, do the work, develop the point of view, right. That there is work to be done. But once you have a point of view, take a risk and share it and know that it’s okay. When you are wrong, you will be wrong. I think there’s often a, a fear of the criticism that will, you know, will follow when you express your point of view. And I think a lot of the council is develop the point of view, take the risk, because no one will know you’re in the room until you open your mouth. Right. And, you know, related, but per perhaps a little different than that, I, I would give the advice to women who are looking for expanded leadership opportunities or more responsibility to be explicit in asking for it. And that’s also something that you hope you keep your head down and do the work and, and you get noticed and, and you get chosen for the special project or the next assignment or the rotation. And often, you know, you’re just not top of mind and that’s okay. So you have to be more explicit about expressing your interest in taking on more responsibility, expanding, you know, your, your remit within the organization or getting on some research project. You have to tell people that you’re interested in doing more than you’ve already been asked to do. 00:37:35 [Speaker Changed] So let me throw you a curve ball. You served or you are serving as a director on the Vanguard Foundation Board? 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] I did serve as a member of the Vanguard Foundation Board when I was at the firm. I also served as a member of the Irish Funds Board. And I also had the opportunity, it’s separate from Vanguard, but related, I also served on Vanguard Charitables board for a number of years. So all of those, you know, through different lenses were opportunities outside of my day-to-day swim lane or, you know, job, if you will, to give back to either the community with regard to the Vanguard Foundation or get involved in our international business through our Irish Funds distribution through that board, or in Vanguard Charitables case. Really think about donor-advised funds and learn more about that. And how, 00:38:23 [Speaker Changed] And that’s a big, that’s like 18 $20 billion, something like that. That’s a big chunk of money that people are saying, help us distribute this philanthropically. 00:38:32 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. Right. 00:38:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Quite, quite fascinating. Alright, let’s jump to our favorite questions. Starting with what are you watching these days or listening to? What’s keeping you entertained 00:38:42 [Speaker Changed] On the, what am I watching? I would say hacks is so good is do you like it? Oh, I love 00:38:48 [Speaker Changed] It. We, we, we, not only do we love the show, but we watch it straight. You know, at the end there’s a little podcast discussion Yes. By the showrunners and the creators. Yeah. And they’re just charming, delightful people. Yeah. 00:39:01 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. For those that don’t know, I, I think it’s, it’s worth a, it’s very different from anything you see on TV right now. Jean Smart is, you know, talk about longevity in a career. She’s in her seventies. I love seeing that. And it’s just a darkly funny, you know, mentorship between one character and a much younger character. It’s, it’s, it’s a good one. 00:39:22 [Speaker Changed] Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:39:26 [Speaker Changed] Man. Too many to count at Vanguard really just spoiled with lots of great leaders, all of whom were mentors in different ways, particularly in the very early days of my career. People like Jeff Moor taking a chance on me, giving me my first job at Vanguard when I was not an obvious choice, really helping me develop a thick skin. He was, he was notorious for giving very straight feedback. Martha King, I mentioned her earlier, just one of my earliest female role models at the firm when there really weren’t that many. There still are not enough across the industry, but many more today than, than back in the, you know, late nineties. And then certainly I mentioned, I’ve already talked about Jack Brennan, bill McNabb and Tim Buckley, but certainly Bill McNabb and Tim Buckley for sure. A figure prominently in, in my career as advocates for me over decades. They are still, to this day, as I think about writing my next chapter and what I wanna do post Vanguard, I still am looking to the mentorship and advocacy of, of both Bill and Tim. So very grateful for them both. 00:40:31 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting list. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading currently? 00:40:37 [Speaker Changed] Well, favorites for sure. You can’t spend 28 years at Vanguard without the required reading. I, a random walk down Wall Street, I think was dropped on my chair, truly within the first month of my joining the firm, one of my 00:40:48 [Speaker Changed] Burton eu Yes. 00:40:49 [Speaker Changed] Bur Bur eu, who was a 00:40:50 [Speaker Changed] Board member on the 00:40:51 [Speaker Changed] Board, right? Yes. Longtime board member at Vanguard. But really a, you know, a required reading on, on passive, the benefits of passive investing. And, and you know, when I joined Vanguard, I, I knew about indexing, but I didn’t know it to the depth that I would later. And so that was, was an early educational book, probably in the same era when Genius failed as a, as a Roger Lowenstein. Yep. Roger Lowenstein and the Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management. Think about when I joined Vanguard in 97, you know, that was all unfolding in the early two thousands. I didn’t know anything about hedge funds. I didn’t know anything about leverage, really. I mean, it was so far afield from what was happening in Malvin, Pennsylvania that it was just like a, a fascinating read and, and really a cautionary tale that 00:41:38 [Speaker Changed] For the financial crisis Yes. Not but a decade later. Correct. All those lessons were totally ignored. If anything, maybe it made people too cocky. Don’t worry about it. The Fed is the Fed puts it, yeah. 00:41:48 [Speaker Changed] Effect. Yeah. The Fed. Yeah. Yeah. That, that’s a fair point. What am I reading now? I just finished and I’m like way behind the Times because a million colleagues had suggested I read Outlive by Peter Atia. You know, it’s, it’s been on bestseller list for multiple years now. Yes. Yeah. But, but fascinating to think about the longevity and the, the notion of health span versus lifespan looking, you know, inwardly for each person, I have some work to do to, to live to a hundred, but, but I’m game for it. And the, the book on my shelf next is related to that, and it’s called the Longevity Principle. And that takes sort of a broader view of how society will need to change to support from an infrastructure, healthcare, financial sector, all these different dimensions that will need to change to support all these people who will be living to maybe a hundred in the future and, and, and not that far away. 00:42:39 [Speaker Changed] And, and the conversation, the way, the way the math works, if you make it into your sixties without dropping dead of a heart attack or whatever, the odds of hitting mid eighties or beyond go up dramatically. Yes. And so suddenly the question is, Hey, have I saved enough money if I’m gonna be around to 85, 90? It’s a genuine planning issue for anybody thinking about their financial future. 00:43:02 [Speaker Changed] You’re right. I remember when we first started the personal advisor offer and we’re, we were creating the advice methodology. We conservatively, you know, our planning horizon was to a hundred years. 00:43:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, every Monte Carlos Inni Ocean, it goes to a hundred. 00:43:15 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And I cannot tell you how many clients at the time said, that’s insane. I’m gonna drop that at 70 or 80 or whatever. Hey. And they would fight with us. And now it’s, you know, it’s not inconceivable. 00:43:25 [Speaker Changed] That doesn’t surprise me at all. Our final two questions. What advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in wealth management or personal financial guidance? 00:43:38 [Speaker Changed] I would say for sure, pay attention to the company and the mission and purpose of that company. Be proud of the company you work for. Worry about that more than the job or the starting salary. Think hard about the company that you wanna connect yourself with. I mean, it’s, it’s unlikely that that many college grads are gonna have a 28 year run at a company like I just did. But even if you’re only gonna be there for a shorter stint, you know, think about the company ahead of the actual job you’re going to do. Because my next piece of advice is do more than is asked. Think about how you can contribute outside of, you know, your finite job description. Lastly, I would say seek to understand the context. When you join a company and you’re right out of college and you’re eager to make a mark, I think it’s really important to understand what came before you. You know, take the time to invest in relationships with your peers and understand the context of what’s going on at the firm and the history behind it before you charge into whatever you’re gonna do. 00:44:41 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of wealth management and investing today that would’ve been useful in 1997 when you were first getting your feet wet? 00:44:51 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well, again, here, I feel like a bit of a wringer because not many 23 year olds have the benefit of people like Jack Brennan or Bill McNabb, et cetera, telling them explicitly. I remember sitting in, in the office with Jack Brennan and he said, all you need to do is live below your means. And it was something that Jack Bobe used to say all the time, and it was instilled in you the minute you got into Vanguard, along with things like invest in the 401k and, and take advantage of the company match and build up an emergency fund, and all these things that are the basic tenets of financial planning. But when you’re in your early twenties, you know, you don’t necessarily focus on, these are things that I actually 28 years later have benefited from because the magic of compounding was a very real thing that I was able to take advantage of before perhaps many of my peers who were working at different companies where that wasn’t such a strong focus, but at Vanguard, such a strong focus. 00:45:49 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you Karen, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Karen Reese, formally of the Vanguard Group, now on the board of Harbor Vest. If you enjoy this conversation, well be sure and check out any of the 550 we’ve done.

Tim Sweeney's name was on a list of attendees for a lunch with Trump and numerous tech and defense executives. By Eddie Makuch on May 13, 2025 at 6:03AM PDT Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney apparently attended a high-profile lunch today, May 13, in Saudi Arabia with US President Donald Trump and other world and business leaders from across the globe. This is according to a list of attendees supplied by the White House and shared by reporter Kaitlan Collins. Some of the other attendees include Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller, just to name a few. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was said to have attended the lunch as well. The New York Times reported that the high-profile executives might have been there to make business deals or lobby Trump and his own officials on tariffs and trade policies in general. Sweeney was the only video game executive on the list of attendees, though. Saudi Arabi's Public Investment Fund has invested tens of billions into the gaming market in recent years, which has prompted some concern from people dismayed by the nation's human rights history. GameSpot has reached out to Epic Games in an attempt to get more details on Sweeney's reported involvement in this lunch. For its part, Chinese internet behemoth Tencent is a minority investor in the company. In 2024, two directors at Epic who had been appointed by Tencent resigned from the Epic board following a US government investigation. Sweeney's Epic Games recently scored a key victory in its fight against Apple, but Fortnite hasn't yet returned to the App Store. As of May 13, Apple is still reviewing Fortnite for release.

Title: Forbes Daily: U.S. Stocks Soar Following Temporary China Trade Deal

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The U.S. and China announced a temporary trade deal Monday, providing a much-needed reprieve for the financial markets. But for some small businesses, it’s not enough. The agreement set the U.S. tariff rate on most Chinese goods at 30%, down from 145%, and while that’s a step in the right direction, it’s still a heavy lift for small firms that rely on Chinese manufacturing. “There has been irreversible damage caused by the tariff policies to my business, and there is no easy way out,” says Kristin Bear, who runs a Florida-based lingerie company. It’s no surprise that amid such uncertainty, hiring at small businesses has fallen: Businesses with fewer than 10 employees have cut more than 366,000 jobs since President Donald Trump took office, a decline of 3%, according to new data analyzed by the bipartisan Joint Economic Committee. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on Monday. As trade tensions between the U.S. and China improved with the temporary deal, stocks surged, leading all three indexes to close at their highest levels in over a month. The tech giants most dependent on strong trade ties between the countries led Monday’s gains, like Amazon, Apple and Nvidia. A rally in Tesla stock led Elon Musk’s fortune to grow by $11 billion, while the world’s second- and third-wealthiest people—Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—enjoyed $14 billion and $16 billion boosts, respectively. Gomez' mom Mandy Teefey (left) and Gomez (right) at the 2017 premiere of Netflix's "13 Reasons Why," ... More which they produced together. Wondermind, the mental health startup cofounded by singer and entrepreneur Selena Gomez, laid off 60% of its 15-person staff Monday, days after Forbes broke the news of its financial woes. The 4-year-old company focuses on promoting mental “fitness,” but multiple employees previously told Forbes the company failed to pay them in recent weeks and owed tens of thousands of dollars to freelancers and vendors. On the eve of President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the kingdom unveiled a state-backed AI company called Humain, as it has worked to transform itself into an AI powerhouse. The project will be chaired by Saudi’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, backed by its sovereign wealth fund, and will be headed up by former Aramco Digital and Rakuten executive Tareq Amin. MORE: Conflict-of-interest worries are swirling around Trump’s four-day visit to the Middle East. The trip starts in Saudi Arabia, where Elon Musk and executives from Palantir, BlackRock, Citigroup and others will attend an investment forum hosted by the Saudi government, as the Trump family continues to expand its business footprint in the region. President Donald Trump dismissed conflict-of-interest concerns over the luxury plane Qatar is expected to give his administration, saying he would donate it to his presidential library after leaving office and that it’s a gift to the Department of Defense, not him. Trump partly justified his use of the aircraft by reiterating complaints that Boeing was taking too long to build new Air Force Ones, and said his administration would accept the gift “in a very public and transparent transaction.” MORE: Congressional lawmakers from both parties spoke out about the White House’s plan to use the jet, with Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) saying, “I don’t want the president of the United States flying on an unsafe plane,” as he accused Qatar of supporting Hamas. Hamas released the last living U.S. citizen it had been holding hostage, Edan Alexander, and his family called on Israel to continue negotiations to help secure the release of all remaining hostages. It’s not clear what Hamas received in exchange for Alexander’s release, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office noted Israel has “not committed to a ceasefire of any kind or the release of terrorists.” Dozens of refugees from South Africa arrived in Washington on Monday, despite the Trump Administration stopping most other refugee operations. The first plane of Afrikaners, a white minority in South Africa, arrived in the U.S. just a few months after Trump signed an executive order accusing the African government of dismantling “equal opportunity in employment, education, and business.” The order calls on leaders within the Trump Administration to “prioritize humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement.” The South African government denies Trump's claims. A military drone begins to land. Defense tech unicorn Shield AI has emerged as a lead contender in the increasingly crowded race against competitors like Anduril and AeroVironment to outfit the U.S. military with killer drones. The $5 billion-valued startup, founded in 2015 by brothers Ryan and Brandon Tseng, sells a suite of hardware and products—including autonomous piloting software that has been used to fly fighter jets. In March, it raised $240 million with the goal of preparing the military for the future of autonomous warfare. But back in April of 2024, as a handful of Navy SEALs gathered outside of Fort Stockton, Texas to watch the company demo its latest drone called the V-BAT, things went sideways as the drone came in for landing. Unlike most drones, which don’t require physical intervention, Shield’s operators needed to assist the drone in landing vertically, like a SpaceX rocket. Instead it dropped to the ground and tipped over, resulting in a grisly incident: When a U.S. service member approached the drone, his fingers were caught in the spinning blades and partially severed. A spokesperson for U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command said in a statement that a service member had three fingers partially amputated during the incident. The person made a full recovery after four months and is now “performing all duties without limitations.” CEO Brandon Tseng said that the V-BAT “had been flying almost 10 years, with a perfect safety record” adding, “The event was a surprise, and it was one that, frankly, I feel terribly about.” But Forbes found that for years, as Shield raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors like Andreessen Horowitz and billionaire Thomas Tull’s USIT, its executives overlooked engineering issues and safety hazards that scuttled contract opportunities, according to former employees, internal documents and legal filings. WHY IT MATTERS Shield’s 1,000-strong workforce has been encouraged to embody a warrior ethos, with slogans like “Do what honor dictates” and “Live as a servant leader.” But the incident with the U.S. Navy, which hasn’t previously been reported, has spotlighted the risks brought by a new generation of hard-charging military startups seeking Pentagon contracts while hyping their companies to Silicon Valley investors, sometimes at the expense of personal safety. MORE Silicon Valley’s Military Drone Companies Have A Serious ‘Made In China’ Problem President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday requiring pharmaceutical companies to match the lowest prices charged by other developed countries for prescription drugs in the U.S. Trump has referred to the concept since his first term as a “most-favored-nation” policy: 30% to 80%: The amount Trump claims his order will reduce prescription drug prices by Nearly 2.8 times: How much higher U.S. drug prices were compared to other countries, a 2024 RAND study found $1,126: The amount Americans spent per capita on prescription drugs compared to $552 for other developed countries, according to one analysis Even the best workplaces have conflict, but it’s best not to get caught up in the negativity. Create boundaries with coworkers and redirect the conversation if a colleague tries to pull you into drama. Look for coworkers who aren’t involved and aim to build positive, collaborative relationships with them—and if the tension is affecting your work, it’s okay to talk to your manager about it. In his second term, President Donald Trump has at least three new ways for allies, favor seekers, foreign governments and pretty much anyone else to direct money to his business empire. Which of the following is not currently a reported funnel to Trump’s businesses? A. Buying Trump Media & Technology Group shares B. Buying his cryptocurrency $TRUMP coin C.

Title: How SEC Chair Paul Atkins plans to shape crypto markets – All details here

Is the SEC finally done with its controversial ‘enforcement-first’ crypto policy? The crypto industry kicked off the week with high anticipation for the U.S. SEC’s 12th May roundtable on “Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain.” Seen as a “spring sprint toward crypto clarity,” the event marks a turning point in regulatory discussions. Digital asset innovators and policymakers are engaging in deeper dialogue on key industry developments. Ahead of the event, BlackRock met with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on the 9th of May. Discussions covered staking mechanisms, tokenization infrastructure, and standards for crypto exchange-traded products. Meanwhile, Cardano’s [ADA] Charles Hoskinson announced a shift from the platform’s traditional, methodical approach. This new, agile strategy aims to adapt quickly to evolving market conditions. Fulfilling all expectations, SEC Chair Paul Atkins, in a keynote address, underscored the event’s significance, declared the dawn of a “new day” for crypto oversight, and outlined intentions to establish a pragmatic regulatory architecture. Notably, Atkins hinted at potential rule changes enabling broker-dealers with alternative trading systems (ATS) to facilitate trades involving non-securities like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Remarking on the same, Atkins said, “A key priority of my chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” Futhermore, Atkins also laid out a transformative vision for U.S. crypto regulation. Committing to a departure from the agency’s historically aggressive stance, Atkins emphasized the need to abandon the “shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later” approach in favor of a well-defined, transparent framework. He added, “It is a new day at the SEC. Policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions.” Gene Hoffman, CEO of Chia Network, captured the changing tone at the SEC when he described the agency’s new leadership as “open-minded and open for business.” Hoffman added, “Instead of focusing solely on risks, this SEC recognizes the significant opportunities decentralized public blockchains create for investors.” This contrasted sharply with the enforcement-heavy era under former Chair Gary Gensler, whose regulatory crackdowns often shook sector growth. Henceforth, while Atkins’ arrival has brought renewed optimism, the road ahead remains complex. Prolonged battles like the SEC vs. Ripple [XRP] case and a backlog of over 70 pending ETF applications, highlighted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, underscore the regulatory hurdles still in play. Amid these developments, the crypto market continues to surge, with global market capitalization reaching $3.4 trillion, reflecting both momentum and mounting expectations for regulatory clarity.
