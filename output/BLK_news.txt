Group plans to buy company behind Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare Frank Keane also operates Volkswagen dealerships in Dublin Frank Keane Motors plans to buy company behind Co Kildare BMW dealership BMW. Photo: Getty Frank Keane Motors – a BMW dealership for almost 60 years – is planning to buy Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare in a deal that’s likely to be worth well in excess of €20m. If approved by the competition watchdog, it will create a group with turnover easily exceeding €300m a year. Frank Keane Motors has just notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) that it intends to buy the entire issued share capital of Pavla Unlimited in Naas. Both companies sell new and used cars and are BMW dealerships, with Conlon & Sons selling the eponymous marque as well as Mini, Jaguar and Land Rover. Frank Keane Motors also sells Volkswagen vehicles and light commercial vehicles. It is also a wholesale distributor of FUSO trucks and MG passenger cars. Today's News in 90 Seconds - November 6th Recent company filings for Pavla – controlled by Ray and Nicholas Conlon - show that last month it issued shares valued at almost €23m to a company called Bonaghmore Holdings. Pavla was only incorporated during the summer. Bonaghmore Holdings is in turn owned by a company called Gledstanes, which was also set up during the summer. The most recent set of publicly available accounts for Bonaghmore Holdings show that it generated sales of €84.8m in the 12 months to the end of August 2023, up from €71.4m a year earlier. The company made a €6.1m pre-tax profit in the 2023 financial year, which compared with almost €6.9m in the previous year. It had shareholder funds of €41.5m at the end of the 2023 financial year. Frank Keane Group is unlimited and does not have to file publicly available accounts. However, its turnover is likely to be north of €250m a year. Founded in 1967, it was awarded the BMW franchise for Ireland that year. It now employs about 300 people. It operates a BMW dealership on the Naas Road in Dublin as well as one on Blackrock in the capital’s southside. It also has a Mini dealership on the Nass Road. The firm has two Volkswagen dealerships, both of which are in Dublin. The CCPC said submissions from third parties in relation to the proposed acquisition of Pavla Unlimited are due by December 13 as part of its preliminary investigation in the deal.

Title: Investor Anthony Pompliano Calls Bitcoin ‘Gold With Wings,’ Says BTC the Savings Account of the New Generation

Longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano believes that the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) is gold on steroids. In a new interview on Fox Business, the founder of venture capital firm Pomp Investments says that the debasement of the US dollar is bullish for both Bitcoin and gold, but the flagship crypto asset could outperform the precious metal due to increasing adoption. “If you look at gold and the S&P 500 over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate is about the same. Gold is up 13% and the S&P is up 14%. Bitcoin has destroyed that. And so I like to say that Bitcoin is gold with wings. Bitcoin and gold both go up for the same reason. They’re debasing the dollar. But Bitcoin is much more sensitive. It’s an earlier asset that the world is trying to price in. What’s very unique about Bitcoin is that it’s a bottom-up story. Most technology goes top-down. Militaries and governments, they adopt it first, then corporations and then finally individuals. They get a smartphone or they get a computer on their desk. They’re the last ones. Bitcoin was the opposite. The individuals got it first. Now we’re seeing corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity start to adopt this. Eventually, it’s going to be central banks and it is going to be governments. Central banks today own 12% of the global gold supply. I believe that they will eventually start to buy Bitcoin. That would be very bullish for the price of Bitcoin.” He also believes that people will increasingly store their wealth in stablecoins and Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank account. “If you think of the traditional financial system, you have a checking account, you got a savings account. That checking account is being replaced by stablecoins. It’s just dollars in a digital rail. Bitcoin is becoming that savings account and the beauty of a savings account is you put your money there and you don’t move it. So if you go and you look on-chain, you can see that more than one out of every two Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years, and two out of every three Bitcoin has not moved in the last 12 months even though Bitcoin’s price has tripled during that time period.” Bitcoin is trading for $67,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Title: ‘I could have been dead’: Food delivery driver in shock after being attacked in Cork

As he recovers from the surgery he underwent on Friday to reconstruct the broken bones in his left leg, Brazilian delivery rider Alexandre Athos Pinheiro Teixeira (23) is still in shock after being chased then rammed as he worked in Cork on Halloween night. Shortly before midnight Mr Teixeira, who also studies English in Ireland, had just completed a delivery on his motorbike in the Blackrock area of the city when he noticed a grey car stopping and reversing in his direction. “I thought someone had gone the wrong way or something, that’s normal. I swerved to avoid the car,” he says. Moments later, when he tried to overtake it, however, he was suddenly attacked by a man “wearing a mask and a bandanna. The car’s back door opened, and a person jumped out of the car towards me. “I thought: ‘Wow, I’m going to get robbed,’ or something like that, but I still didn’t know if it was a Halloween prank. And I sped up. Then the person tried to pull me but he couldn’t. I sped up and left. “I thought they were going to leave me alone at that point, but they didn’t. My motorbike isn’t very fast and their car was much faster. So, when they caught up to me, I braked and turned back to try to lose them.” To try to escape, Mr Teixeira entered a residential area but he was caught as he tried to make a sudden turn. “They knocked me off the motorcycle with the car, but at that moment I hadn’t been hurt yet. I was fine,” he says. The same attacker who had earlier jumped out of the car emerged from the vehicle again. “I started screaming: ‘Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me?’” The man started swinging punches in the direction of Mr Teixeira, who sought to hit him back. “I managed to punch him and he got back in the car,” he says. He was then caught off guard for a moment and the driver accelerated towards him. “This part is a kind of a blur in my mind, but I remember my leg cracking. I think it got between the fender (mudguard) of my motorcycle and the bumper of the car,” Mr Teixeira said. [ Gardaí recover stolen car used to ram Deliveroo driver (23) in alleged road rage incidentOpens in new window ] The occupants of the car left the scene, abandoning their victim who was lying trapped by his motorbike with severe compound fractures in his left leg. “If I had landed on my hip,” he says, “I could have been in a wheelchair. If I had landed on my head near the car, I could have been dead. They would have killed me.” Mr Teixeira told The Irish Times he managed to call an emergency group of delivery workers and send them his location. “They came to where I was and helped me,” he says. Residents also heard the collision and discovered the victim in severe pain on the street and called emergency assistance. He was brought to Cork University Hospital, where he underwent surgery. “I think it’ll be a few months of recovery,” he says. Mr Teixeira says he saw a man driving the car, a woman front passenger, and another man in the back. All were in their 20s, he believes. Gardaí recovered a stolen Skoda Kodiaq – believed to have been used to ram Mr Teixeira – burnt out in a field in Carrignavar, 12km north of Cork city, early on Friday morning and have begun a technical examination of the vehicle. The same car is believed to have rammed a Garda vehicle at about 2am on the Old Mallow Road on the northside of the city, about 8km from the scene of the hit and run. Two gardaí were treated for minor injuries at the scene. Gardaí suspect that the occupant or occupants of the stolen Skoda Kodiaq were collected by a driver in another car. Gardaí have requested witnesses or anyone with footage of either incident to contact them at Anglesea Street station at 021 452 000 or the Confidential Line at 1800 666 111. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the state fund revealed it has picked up $10 million worth of shares from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). What’s surprising is that the fund now owns more Ethereum than Bitcoin, despite the latter being approved first by the securities regulator many months in advance. Monday’s records show the fund scooped a further $1.1 million worth of shares from the digital asset manager’s Ethereum Mini Trust. It also marks the first U.S. state pension fund to invest in Ethereum ETFs, providing crypto enthusiasts with confidence the asset is becoming more entrenched in the traditional financial world. It follows the fund’s recent purchase of $6.6 million worth of ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in July, which followed the SEC's regulatory approval of the asset class for the investment vehicle in January. ETHE represents a fractional ownership of Ethereum held by Grayscale on behalf of the trust’s shareholders. Each share gives indirect exposure to the performance of Ethereum without the need for direct ownership. ETHE has experienced significant net outflows since its conversion to an ETF in July 2024. On its first trading day, Grayscale’s flagship Ethereum fund saw outflows of $484 million, and by early August, total outflows had exceeded $2 billion, data from SoSoValue shows. The launch of multiple spot US-based Ethereum ETFs by firms this year, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, has all but intensified competition, particularly when it comes to fees. While ETHE charges 2.5%, rivals BlackRock (ETHA) and Fidelity (FETH) are expected to charge 0.12% and 0.25% following the expiration of their fee waiver slated for December 31.

Pensions advisory firm Cartwright announced Monday that it had told an unnamed client in the UK to make a 3% allocation to the leading cryptocurrency. The firm said that it made the recommendation because of Bitcoin’s long-term gains. The cryptocurrency has risen in price by nearly 100,000% since 2013, CoinGecko data shows. “Trustees of the unnamed scheme choose to make a 3% Bitcoin allocation, reflecting the scheme’s relatively long investment time horizon,” the announcement said. Cartwright’s director of investment consulting at Cartwright, Sam Roberts, said that he hoped the “strategic move” would be followed by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he said, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright said it expects institutional adoption of Bitcoin to be similar to when pension schemes started buying equities in the 1970s: It may be slow at first, but then eventually will seem like a bad idea to not allocate the asset to a portfolio. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has grown around the world—but particularly in the U.S.—following the January approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds allow investors to buy exposure to the cryptocurrency via stock-like shares that trade on regulated exchanges. Major Wall Street players including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the funds, and have so far collectively snapped up over 1 million Bitcoin—or $67 billion worth at today’s prices Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Lex: Warren Buffett’s Apple trade exposes Berkshire’s dilemma

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Lex is the flagship investment column of the Financial Times and has published in the newspaper since 1945. OPINION What is the next great investment idea? And what are the chances that Warren Buffett will be the person to identify it? Wall Street likes his odds. Shares in the class B of Berkshire Hathaway are up 25% so far in 2024. And the rally comes as Buffett has been rapidly paring back his blockbuster win in Apple stock. On Saturday Berkshire Hathaway reported its third-quarter results, most notably that its cash and marketable securities balance had swelled to $325 billion (NZ$543.9b). A big chunk of that has come from share sales of Apple whose value for Berkshire now stands at $70b, down from a peak of $178b. Berkshire invested initially in Apple in 2016 when its share price was around $25 a share. Today Apple trades above $200. Berkshire’s total book value through the third quarter was $631b, while its public equity market capitalisation is just shy of $1 trillion. That premium to net asset value reflects a vote of confidence from shareholders that Buffett, at 94, has another similar masterstroke in him. Buffett for now, however, is increasingly content to clip US Treasury coupons earning a few percentage points, risk free, with no dividends or real buybacks for Berkshire shareholders. It comes as other big pools of capital – alternative asset managers as well as BlackRock – are pouring funds into all types of plain and exotic private credit as well as long-tailed infrastructure and data centre deals. Blackstone, for example, has deployed $123b in the past 12 months mostly away from either public or even private equity. To be sure, Berkshire’s property and casualty insurance business carries out all sorts of sophisticated trading and hedging activities. But the investment group is best known for largely buying public, large-cap equities as well as mega operating business platforms such as power utilities and railroads. In the absence of a financial markets crisis where Buffett could play white knight to handsome reward, there is a question in calm markets if he needs to choose less vanilla securities. The sheer size of Berkshire now makes it hard to find single investments that can move the needle. Its securities portfolio of more than $300b has fewer than 30 stocks and the next Apple probably needs to be an up-and-coming Big Tech luminary. Buffett’s Apple bonanza helped obscure the dearth of juicy opportunities for Berkshire. That dilemma is now back on the table. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against other Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet–at the same time–the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren’t immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry “is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness.” Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren’t impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don’t see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider’s downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer “are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry.” This is because the firm “has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest.” Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market’s rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk’s car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven’t done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you’re interested in knowing more about this stock, we’ve included it in today’s list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn’t skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies’ October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July’s figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let’s take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician operating an automated semiconductor processing machine with laser accuracy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 84 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.49% Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is one of the few companies in the world that makes and sells products that are used in several phases of semiconductor fabrication. These phases include etching, deposition, and managing intra-chip connecting circuits called interconnects. Its product portfolio also makes Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a good example of a chip stock that is struggling these days even though AI optimism still persists on Wall Street. The shares are down 2.58% year to date due to multiple factors. Firstly, during its fiscal 2024, 42% of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s revenue came from the memory industry. This industry has struggled in 2023 and has been on a slow recovery this year which hasn’t helped ignite investor consequences. Secondly, 42% of its revenue came from China, where not only have economic struggles hurt Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) revenue but investors are also wary of future sanctions. Artisan Partners mentioned Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Elevance. Lam Research shares rose 10% during the quarter and are up 67% over the past year, primarily due to optimism around the pending investment cycle in semiconductor capital expenditures. Lam is one of the largest equipment manufacturers used to make semiconductor chips. This equipment, commonly referred to as WFE (wafer fabrication equipment), is expected to experience significant growth due to a combination of a cyclical rebound in memory chips and growing demand for new AI-related chips. Lam’s product portfolio is particularly well positioned to benefit from both trends and should grow even faster than the overall market. Its shares now trade at ~30X prior peak earnings, which suggests this dynamic is well understood by the market and is mostly priced in.” Overall, LRCX ranks 7th on our list of Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LRCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Crypto Voters In 2024 And Beyond: Shaping Policy And Political Power

PARIS, FRANCE - JANUARY 11: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital ... [+] cryptocurrency Bitcoin is displayed in front of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) logo on January 11, 2024 in Paris, France. The first American Bitcoin ETF was authorized by the SEC (Commissioner of the American Stock Exchange) on Wednesday January 10, 2024. Around ten of the world's largest financial asset managers have filed an application with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin. ETFs. After blocking bitcoin from entering Wall Street for more than 10 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in bitcoin. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) The 2024 election cycle has brought an unexpected issue to the forefront of U.S. politics: cryptocurrency. Both major political parties are addressing digital assets, blockchain technology, and regulatory frameworks, as crypto has grown from a niche investment to a mainstream topic. Candidates are now actively courting the "crypto voter," recognizing the widespread appeal and economic potential of the digital asset economy. Crypto’s newfound prominence is fueled by recent moves from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, which have entered the Bitcoin ETF market, lending further legitimacy to crypto assets. Political action committees like the Stand With Crypto Alliance and Fairshake Super PAC are also pouring resources into pro-crypto candidates, positioning cryptocurrency as a policy issue that cuts across party lines. As political candidates and parties look to gain traction with voters, crypto has proven to be a compelling, if divisive, topic that speaks to younger, tech-savvy demographics and finance industry titans alike. In this election, crypto’s appeal in key swing states could impact close races as candidates respond to a unique confluence of voter interest and economic opportunity. Polling data from industry leaders such as Digital Currency Group (DCG), Paradigm, and Stand With Crypto highlights a distinct “crypto voter” demographic. This emerging constituency is becoming a powerful influence in electoral decisions. Stand With Crypto reports that 71% of self-identified crypto voters across political parties prefer candidates who support transparent and fair crypto regulations. This figure underscores mounting frustration over vague and restrictive U.S. crypto policies. Additionally, a DCG survey shows that 62% of young voters (ages 18–34) are “more likely” to support a candidate who advocates for crypto-friendly policies, as this demographic views digital assets as essential for financial inclusion, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems. Crypto is also gaining traction in swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, where Paradigm polling found that 28% of likely voters consider a candidate’s stance on crypto important. Stand With Crypto’s data further highlights crypto’s relevance for minority voters in swing states; for instance, 23% of Black and Latino voters rate pro-crypto policies as a top priority, emphasizing the potential for digital assets to broaden access to financial services in underserved communities. Polling reveals that distrust in traditional financial institutions is a significant factor for crypto interest among voters. DCG reports that 58% of respondents cited distrust of banks and financial institutions as a primary reason for exploring digital assets, pointing to a broader trend of viewing decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain as viable alternatives to traditional banking systems. Interest in crypto spans the political spectrum, with 43% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats favoring “sensible regulation” to promote innovation without stifling growth. Despite bipartisan appeal, support for crypto-friendly candidates leans slightly Democratic, with 54% favoring candidates like Vice President Harris, who emphasizes crypto’s potential to promote economic advancement for the middle class. For many crypto voters, financial inclusion remains central; nearly 75% view digital assets as a means to create economic opportunity, particularly for communities historically marginalized by traditional finance. These findings illustrate how crypto’s role in the 2024 election is nuanced, resonating particularly with younger and minority voters. Candidates paying attention to these trends are likely to adopt more balanced and informed regulatory approaches. Money has long been a double-edged sword in American politics. Financial contributions help amplify candidates’ platforms but can also create imbalances. Financial backing enables candidates to reach more voters and cover costs for travel, events, and advertisements. However, donations from wealthier interests can tilt the playing field, creating the perception that policies favor the elite over the public. This influx of crypto money, particularly from PACs and industry-focused initiatives, adds another layer of complexity, as blockchain-based prediction markets like Polymarket allow users to gauge public sentiment on political outcomes. While these decentralized markets offer real-time data, they also pose regulatory challenges and concerns over transparency. Blockchain-based prediction markets such as Polymarket provide a unique view of public sentiment on political outcomes by allowing users to wager on election results. Although these platforms offer valuable insights, they also highlight the need for new regulatory frameworks to manage potential manipulation risks. Polymarket’s emergence reflects the broader impact of blockchain technology in politics, where its applications extend beyond financial innovation into political influence. The trajectory of cryptocurrency in U.S. policy will largely depend on the new administration’s approach to balancing innovation with consumer protection. Institutional interest in digital assets, as seen in the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and DeFi platforms, suggests that crypto is here to stay. However, to responsibly harness this potential, the U.S. must adopt forward-thinking policies that encourage innovation while managing risks. To address the critical needs of the digital economy, the next administration must consider the following: The 2024 election has solidified cryptocurrency’s role as a transformative force in politics. Its ability to bridge divides and appeal to diverse constituencies positions digital assets as an influential issue for American voters. As the next administration shapes its crypto policies, its approach to regulation, financial inclusion, and international cooperation will determine the U.S.’s standing in the global digital economy. By embracing sound policies, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead the way, fostering a prosperous future for early adopters and cautious newcomers alike. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Chip fever has created an $11 billion debt market backed by Nvidia's AI-enabling GPUs

Top Wall Street firms have loaned billions to a handful of tech companies that have used Nvidia's artificial intelligence-enabling GPUs as collateral, The Finanacial Times reported. According to the FT, big financial institutions including BlackRock, Blackstone, Pimco, and Carlyle, have made over $11 billion in loans to "neocloud" companies, tech companies that provide cloud services to other tech firms building AI products. These firms are among some of Nvidia's largest customers and include names like CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs. Collectively, they have purchased tens of thousands of Nvidia's highly sought-after chips and have offered them as collateral for loans that they use to buy even more GPUs, the report said. There are concerns, though, over the value of Nvidia's GPUs, with the price of existing AI chips potentially coming down as more advanced models are released and as companies potentially dial back AI spending. Having access to GPUs is no longer like having a "golden ticket to Willy Wonka's factory," as it was considered to be a year ago, a senior executive at one of CoreWeave's lenders told the FT. Leasing contracts between neocloud firms and tech groups, meanwhile, are poised to expire in the coming years. That could result in a huge supply of chips making their way back to the market, the report added. CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Nvidia declined to comment. Elsewhere on Wall Street, there are concerns that Nvidia's huge pace of growth cannot be sustained, with doubts rising about returns on AI investment by corporations and the threat of competition from other chip makers muscling into the AI space.

The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, indicating a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at JPMorgan and Fitch Ratings had predicted two additional interest rate trims by the end of 2024 and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. The CME Group's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at this week's November meeting at 98%. The current probability of the benchmark rate being taken down by another 25 basis points at the December meeting is 78%. But some CEOs appear skeptical. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia's showcase economic conference, the Future Investment Initiative, they see more inflation on the horizon for the U.S., as the nation's economic activity and both presidential candidates' policies involve developments that will potentially be inflationary and stimulatory — such as public spending, the onshoring of manufacturing and tariffs. A group of CEOs speaking at an FII panel moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the bosses of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year. No one put their hand up. "I think inflation is stickier, honestly, you look at the kind of jobs report and the wage reports in the U.S., I think it's going to be hard for inflation to come down to the 2% level," Jenny Johnson, Franklin Templeton president and CEO, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday, saying she thinks only one further interest rate cut will take place this year. "Remember a year ago, we were all here talking about recession? Was there going to be [one]? Nobody's talking about recession anymore," she said. Larry Fink, whose mammoth BlackRock fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, also sees one rate reduction before the end of 2024. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 [basis-point cut], but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at another FII panel last week. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared with the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, implying a slowdown in price growth. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. On Friday, new data showed U.S. job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020. Markets largely ignored the bad news, as the nonfarm payrolls report flagged acute climate and labor disruptions. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said inflation will more embedded into the global economy than what market participants are currently predicting, meaning price rises could prove to be stickier than the consensus. "That doesn't mean that it's going to rear its head in a particularly ugly way, but I do think there's the potential, depending on policy actions that are taken, that it can be more of a headwind than the current market consensus," he said. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick went even further, declaring last Tuesday that the days of easy money and zero interest rates are firmly in the past. "The end of financial repression, of zero interest rates and zero inflation, that era is over. Interest rates will be higher, will be challenged around the world. And the end of 'the end of history' — geopolitics are back and will be part of the challenge for decades to come," Pick said, referencing the famous 1992 Francis Fukuyama book, "The End of History and the Last Man," which argued that conflicts between nations and ideologies were a thing of the past with the ending of the Cold War. Speaking on Eisen's panel Tuesday, Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan even questioned why the Fed was cutting rates at a time when so much fiscal stimulus had propped up a healthy-looking U.S. economy. He noted the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act and an increase in defense production. "We're all talking about, in the U.S., of shades of good. We really are talking about shades of good. And to come back to your point on rates, we massively increased rates, and yet, [the] stock market [is] at a record high, no unemployment, capital market issuance at will, and we're stimulating the economy?" he said. "I'm trying to remember why we're cutting rates, other than to try and equalize the bottom quartile," he later added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Here’s How Much J.D. Vance Is Worth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/11/04/heres-how-much-jd-vance-is-worth/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T06:29:26Z
Full Content:
Update (Nov. 4, 2024): Two years ago, JD Vance was an Ohio venture capitalist best known for writing a book that helped explain the rise of Donald Trump to liberal coastal elites. Today, he’s a firebrand senator whose first and only election victory was bankrolled by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and who now has a shot of becoming Donald Trump’s heir apparent. Since we published his net worth estimate back in July, not much has changed on the financial front for him—media attention has mostly focused on past and present controversial remarks about abortion, women, immigrants and more. But a promotion to vice president would come with a compensation bump to $235,000 from his current Senate salary of $174,000. It would also set the 40-year-old up for a future White House run of his own—and all the monetary perks that come with it. Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, come from two different Americas. In Trump’s, fathers start passing down real-estate fortunes to their kids when they are toddlers. In Vance’s, fathers don’t even leave kids with their last names. Raised mostly by his mother’s parents, the Vances, J.D. Vance catapulted himself from Rust Belt poverty to coastal high society with a degree from Yale Law School, a marriage to another lawyer and the publication of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a memoir about Vance’s upbringing. The book came out in the summer of 2016 just as Donald Trump was surging in the polls, leaving liberals searching for something, anything, to explain Trump’s popularity in Middle America. “Hillbilly Elegy” made Vance rich—it reportedly sold more than three million copies—and turned him into a national figure. Today, he is worth an estimated $10 million. Given where he started, it’s a remarkable sum, one that solidifies Vance’s place in circles that might have made his younger self uncomfortable. Vance wrote in his book about how odd he found a particular kind of charity—wealthy families picking out gifts for low-income kids, not knowing what those kids actually wanted or needed. “I grew up in a world where everyone worried about how they’d pay for Christmas,” he wrote. “Now I live in one where opportunities abound for the wealthy and privileged to shower their generosity on the community’s poor.” V ance’s maternal grandparents moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio as part of the 1950s mass migration to industrial centers. His grandfather worked in an Armco steel plant his whole career, and they raised three kids. That included Vance’s mother, who had Vance, her second child, in 1984, at age 23, with her second husband. By then, the Steel Belt had begun to rust, eventually leaving Middletown “little more than a relic of American industrial glory,” as Vance put it. His childhood was chaotic, laced with dropouts, alcoholics and violence, problems he chalks up to both structural factors—economic insecurity, a culture that “encourages social decay”—and individual bad decisions. Vance’s father was largely out of the picture early, and his mother cycled through husbands, abusive episodes and rehab stints. A product of his environment, moving between homes, sometimes Vance was dysfunctional, too. The only relative stability he had came from his grandparents, who stressed education, but Vance racked up so many unexcused absences from class at one point that the school district threatened his divorced parents with prosecution. He finished his freshman year of high school with a 2.1 grade-point average. Life changed when Vance moved in with his grandmother as a sophomore. (His grandfather had died a few years earlier). He got a part-time job as a cashier, and his grades improved. Vance contemplated college, balked at the price and instead enlisted in the Marines, earning about $1,000 a month after taxes. He served in Iraq and used extra money he won from playing online poker to pay for his grandmother’s health insurance. He also learned how to save money, balance a checkbook and invest. “The Marine Corps,” Vance wrote, “taught me how to live like an adult.” He finished his service in 2007 and enrolled at The Ohio State University. Vance excelled, graduating in less than two years, then went to Yale Law School in 2010. Military service and financial aid helped Vance avoid accruing massive debt—and high-paying gigs at elite law firms during his Yale years helped, too. He graduated in 2013, and today, Vance has no student debt. Equipped with a law degree, Vance and his girlfriend, Yale classmate Usha Chilukuri, both clerked in Cincinnati for a year, then married soon after, changing their last names to “Vance.” The newlyweds moved to Washington D.C., where Usha clerked for then-circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Vance started at a corporate law firm. They purchased a home east of the Capitol building in August 2014 for $590,000, borrowing just over $600,000 to pay for it. The home is worth about $850,000 today, and they owe an estimated $480,000 against it—the only debt they appear to have on their balance sheet. Vance and his wife, Usha, appeared on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday night, where he was acclaimed Trump's VP nominee. Next, the couple headed to the Left Coast, where Usha started at the San Francisco office of Munger, Tolles and Olson. J.D. pivoted to tech, finding like-minded conservative circles in Silicon Valley. He worked at a biotech outfit, then joined Mithril, a venture capital firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel. I n 2016, Vance published “Hillbilly Elegy,” which launched him onto the national stage, turning a poor kid from Ohio into a more genteel spokesperson for the white working class than the rich guy from New York. Vance appeared on CNN and graced the pages of The New York Times, but he didn’t always enjoy his new role, unsettled by his proximity to what he now terms “the liberal establishment.” In 2017, Vance announced that he was moving back to Ohio and starting an organization to fight the opioid epidemic. It didn’t go well. Our Ohio Renewal raised $220,000 in 2017 and spent $45,000 on a survey, $71,000 on salaries and wages, $63,000 on management and $11,000 on advertising and promotions. His wife, meanwhile, left her law firm in 2017 to clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, then returned to private practice in D.C. at the same firm. J.D. pivoted back to startups, joining AOL billionaire Steve Case in his efforts to invest in VC-starved Middle America. In 2018, Vance and his wife bought a $1.4 million home in Cincinnati’s left-leaning East Walnut Hills—his neighborhood voted for Joe Biden in 2020 by 40 points. Forbes estimates that the house, now owned by an LLC, is worth about $1.8 million. Online listings say the property contains 5 bedrooms and 4,700 square feet, offering plenty of room for Vance, his wife and their three kids. A year after buying the Cincinnati home, Vance started his own venture firm, Narya. His investments hinted at his political inclinations. He bet on Rumble, a right-leaning YouTube competitor that now serves as a key partner to Trump’s Truth Social platform. His firm also invested in Strive Asset Management, the fund provider that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, another Ohioan, founded to take on the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. By 2021, with somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of venture holdings and liquid assets, Vance moved on to a new challenge, politics. Thiel, his old venture partner, seeded a U.S. Senate run with $10 million, then pitched in another $5 million as the race heated up. Other billionaires who had crossed paths with Vance in the business world declined to donate anything. Something had changed about Vance. Once a “never-Trump” Republican, he began bowing down to the former president, ultimately winning Trump’s endorsement. It was enough to beat former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, and Vance stayed loyal to Trump after winning. On Saturday, he blamed Joe Biden for the assassination attempt that nearly killed Trump. As a Senate candidate, Vance leaned hard into right-wing messaging on immigration, Ukraine and support for former president Trump. Vance’s triumphant return to Washington D.C. came with another real estate investment in a blue area—in early 2023, he dropped $1.6 million on a 2,500-square-foot home in Alexandria, Virginia, which voted by huge margins for Biden in 2020. Asked if Vance has friends in the area, one neighbor said, “No, God, no, no,” before noting that Sean Spicer lives nearby. Forbes estimates Vance’s home is worth about $1.8 million today, bringing his total real estate holdings across three homes to around $4 million. He may not need the house in Virginia for long. If Vance becomes vice president, as polls currently suggest he will, he and his family will be able to move into the Naval Observatory, the official vice presidential residence, 10 minutes from the White House and hundreds of miles from hillbilly country.

Title: For investors, does it matter who wins the US election?

Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime”. The reality, says Fink, “is over time it doesn’t matter”. Is he right? Ordinarily, yes. With stock returns, there are many more important factors than politics. Stocks usually rise no matter who is in power, so professionals routinely advise investors not to fret about politics. Some republicans believed Obama would be terrible for stocks. Some Democrats panicked when Trump was elected in 2016. Nevertheless, stocks rose in both instances. As Dimensional Fund Advisors founder David Bloom notes, “shareholders are investing in companies, not in politicians”. Stocks may well rise significantly during a second Trump administration, and many on Wall Street are enthused about possible corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Nevertheless, Fink’s nonchalance is misplaced. Trump is no ordinary politician. Tariffs, trade wars, huge budget deficits, increased inflation expectations, further deglobalisation, mass deportations – one sees why 23 Nobel economists recently penned a letter endorsing Kamala Harris. Worse, Trump’s authoritarian instincts are deeply problematic. As Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf warns, Trump “is at the very least ‘fascistic’ and can be credibly called a fascist”. Autocracy is not good for investors, with research showing a strong link between democracy and stock returns. Capitalism relies on independent courts and institutions to ensure fair rules and support a stable market environment. Replacing civil servants with political appointees could endanger reliable reporting of economic data. Additionally, investors should be alarmed by Trump’s desire to end the Federal Reserve’s independence and give the president influence over rate policy. Now, some argue Trump’s bark is worse than his bite. Even if there is institutional erosion, it might unfold slowly, so stocks may do just fine under a Trump presidency. A bad president can still be good for stocks. Still, ignoring political risks may no longer be wise; healthy markets require healthy democratic institutions.

Title: Great restaurants around Ireland for a night out

Almost a year in, Niall Davidson has settled into his Canal Docks location. A new casual bar and bottle shop has just opened and there are plans for a test kitchen, which is an indication of where his ambitions lie. The food is as spectacular as ever, with freshly landed fish, seafood, pork chops and hunks of beef from six-year old ex-dairy cows cooked over a custom-built Rhys Allen levitation grill. Corinna Hardgrave Andra Bhavan has branched out to Abbey Street with its extensive menu of southern Indian dishes and it now has Ireland’s first South Indian cocktail bar. The menu stretches from breakfast-style dosas, idlis, and vadas to heartier fare as the day moves on, such as mixed thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, lamb Chettinadu, and birianis. If you know the Marlborough Street original, expect much of the same, with the bonus of cocktails. CH Gaz Smith has built a reputation for seafood and steak that few can rival. His dedication to delivering the freshest seafood extends to rising at the crack of dawn to get the catch direct from local boats, and on busy days, the contents of their indulgent seafood platters can change three to four times. With steaks from Hannan’s, and an extensive wine list, Big Mike’s is a spot for celebrations big and small. Joanne Cronin Foxrock locals are lucky to have this spot, run by Alan and Elaine Wang. Start with Castletownbere crab on sourdough or pan-fried scallops, and move on to the decadent shellfish risotto. The 45-day dry-aged rib-eye steak, paired with crispy onions and a rich Béarnaise, and sole on the bone are cooked with pinpoint precision. The well-priced wine list rounds off the experience. CH A long-established fixture in Ireland’s Chinese restaurant scene, China Sichuan offers elevated Sichuan cooking in comfortable surroundings. Second-generation owner Kevin Hui and his team of classically trained chefs have developed a menu that combines the best of Sichuan flavours with Irish ingredients. Look out for beef tenderloin with black pepper and merlot, Sichuan favourite dan-dan noodles or delightful luóbo gao (crispy turnip cubes). JC Aishling Moore is one of the sharpest culinary talents in the country, her cooking driven by a “whole catch” philosophy that keeps things exciting and unpredictable. Much of her menu depends on what the day boats haul in, allowing her to flex her creative muscles on the fly. Her approach to flavour is as agile as it is bold, starting with Rossmore oysters topped with elderflower vinegar granita, and moving on to larger plates such as pan-roasted hake, paired with tomatillo kakut and a punchy beetroot acchar. CH Gursha operates as a supper club with a €29.90 tasting menu, so you’ll need to book and pay in advance. Prepared by Ethiopian native Yagerenesh Tadesse, (known to all as Mamay), her slow-cooked, berbere-spiced dishes, brimming with onions and chillies, are mostly vegetarian and served family-style on vast platters of injera, the tangy fermented bread made from teff. The food is bold, hearty and shared. Their next big project is brewing Ethiopian honey wine (mead), which is still in the experimental phase. CH Eric Mathews’ and Richie Barrett’s restaurant exploded on to the scene a year ago, making an immediate impact with its fiery cooking and bold flavours. The menu jumps from light bites to sharing plates, with pasta and meats kissed by flames. The potato focaccia with carbonara butter feels almost criminal in its indulgence, while Matthews’ Irish coffee riff on tiramisu is rich and delicious. It’s brash, unapologetic, and full throttle flavour. CH Kevin Burke’s restaurant is the kind of place where getting a table feels like winning the lottery – it’s one of the hottest bookings around. It’s a buzzy room with food that is sharp and inventive. Kick off with small plates such as crispy rabbit paired with sauce gribiche, before graduating to heavier hitters such as hamachi belly. Downstairs, a private diningroom for six-to-10 people can be yours with enough advance notice, and a minimum spend to match the experience. CH When chef Gráinne O’Keeffe was seeking to name her first restaurant, it was only natural to name it after her late grandmother Mae. It’s housed above the French Paradox wine shop, O’Keeffe’s seasonal cooking complemented by wine pairings sourced from below. The glorious tarte Tatin and selection of handmade knives have become fixtures, and in good news for locals, she has recently added a Friday lunchtime service. JC When chef Luis Martin took over the former Old Couch Café, he maintained its quirky nature, all the while putting his Spanish stamp on the menu. Bringing experience from his time in the kitchen at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Cenador de Amos, he seamlessly integrates Irish produce into dishes such as rabbit and carrot escabeche or quail and dark chocolate. Plans are under way with a local farmer to grow vegetables for next year’s menus. JC Regardless of whether you are dining during daytime or night-time, the large glass windows at Ox provide a sense of openness to this beautiful, understated room close to the river Lagan. Refurbished in 2023, it is the canvas on which chef Stephen Toman and sommelier Alain Kerloc’h paint their magic. Look out for smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic or lobster with broad beans and lemon grass. JC Owners Alice Jary and Richard Kennan draw on their vast experience and travels to produce contemporary dishes such as Velvet Cloud labneh and peaches, adorned with glorious green beans and hazelnuts, or flavourful shiitake and tofu dumplings with Szechuan vinegar and roasted seaweed. With bar and restaurant seating, plus a creative cocktail list, and open from lunch to late night, Rúibín is truly a gem in Galway. JC Fidelity Studio is now linked to Fidelity Bar by a sleek interior door, making it easy to drift between the two. Sister 7′s menu, a collab with Big Fan, features dumplings, bao and inventive sharing plates. Don’t skip the “lip sticks”, deep-fried vegetable cakes of fermented rice, celeriac, yam and tofu. DJs spin tunes from a bright orange booth, keeping the energy alive as the night rolls on. CH The Dunmore is a space built for celebrations – dramatic, lively and perfect for catching up with friends over fresh seafood and sizzling dishes from the charcoal-burning oven. Midweek, the early-evening menu – two/three courses for €29/€35 – is particularly good value, with Duncannon mussels, seafood pie, fire-roasted chicken and a Pat McLoughlin beef burger featuring. For larger groups, the mezzanine is your spot, hosting up to 20 people. CH Knockranny has taken a more laid-back approach with the rebranding of La Fougère into The Fern Grill, now focused on relaxed dining, local ingredients and a new cocktail counter. Head chef Seamus Commons fires up daily catches, dry-aged Irish Black Angus, and lamb on the Josper Basque charcoal grill. Choose from the a la carte or the €55, five-course Taste of Knockranny menu. CH Owner and chef Brian Murray describes his style as “cooked with grá and kissed with a little fire”. Since returning to his native city, he has transformed the former Old Thompsons Bakery building into a modern, stylish restaurant. The menus change regularly, offering dishes of black sole with surf clams or Fitzgerald’s lamb served family style. JC The Tannery has become synonymous with modern Irish cooking, combining a cookery school and elegant town house accommodation with Paul and Máire Flynn’s famous restaurant. Chef Damien Derwin has shouldered Paul’s legacy, maintaining the tradition of hearty and creative food made with local ingredients. The revamped website now makes it easier than ever to book an overnight B&B stay with dinner. JC Having spent many years travelling the world and working at Belfast’s Yugo, chef Sean Lafferty opened Umi to share his love for Asian flavours. Umi has a vibrant atmosphere that seamlessly reflects the creative food including binchotan grilled Wagyu steak, and crispy dumplings made with local pork and chilli nut oil. They even offer their own wine, Rainbow Pie, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer, with plans to add a white wine. JC Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns this Waterford spot, so the wine list is exceptional. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. The menu focuses on wild fish and seasonal ingredients, with dishes such as Kilmore Quay crab with pickled cucumber, free-range pork terrine with foie gras, and roasted monkfish with smoked almond romesco and fennel.

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Eastern Europe has recorded increased crypto adoption, with DeFi transactions as the key driver. The region received more than $499 billion worth of crypto assets between July 2023 and June this year. Moreover, Eastern Europe contributes over 11% of the total crypto value worldwide and ranks as the fourth-largest global crypto market. Eastern Europe has recorded significant growth in its crypto adoption within the past few months. In a recent report, on-chain analytics company Chainalysis indicated the region received about $499.14 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Further, the report revealed that the region now ranks globally as the fourth-largest crypto market. Its digital assets activity accounted for 11% of the cumulative global inflows within the period under analysis. In detail, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Eastern Europe saw a remarkable surge. The region recorded over $165 billion of DeFi-related transactions, representing a third of its total crypto deals within the period. Amid the events of war and turbulence within the region, DeFi activity grew by almost 40% in Eastern Europe. Moreover, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) witnessed more inflows, especially from Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus. These positive indications placed Eastern Europe third in global DeFi adoption, only behind Latin America and Sub-Africa. Amid the growing DeFi engagement, centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate crypto activity within the region. The report indicated that the CEXs received more than $324 billion in crypto asset transactions. Russia and Ukraine pioneer crypto adoption and growth within Eastern Europe with remarkable crypto transaction volumes amid their ongoing war and turbulent events. According to Chainalysis, Russia recorded over $182 billion in crypto assets flows to emerge at the top. Ukraine trails in the second position, with transaction flows amounting to more than $106 billion. Also, DEXs in Russia and Ukraine posted inflows growth of over 173% and 160%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Chainalysis report indicated that Ukraine and Russia ranked sixth and seventh in the 2024 global crypto adoption index. Ukraine made the most drive in the market’s activity in institutional and professional transfers. The country’s prominent activity came from large institutional transfers of over $10 million and mid-sized institutional transfers between $1 million and $10 million. A leading CEX in Ukraine, WhiteBIT, acknowledged the positive overturn of crypto transactions. WhiteBIT told Chainalysis: “Institutional and professional crypto transfers in Ukraine have surged as many seek financial stability amid the ongoing war, with cryptocurrencies viewed as a safer alternative.” Also, WhiteBIt highlighted certain factors that fueled the spike in crypto adoption and transfers in the country. These include inflation, market volatility, war-related sanctions, and the increasing institutional attraction in Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. Citing order book data, the Chainalysis report also noted that Bitcoin acquisition via the Ukraine hryvnia surged drastically over the past year, above $882 million. This trend reflects that Ukrainians have potentially adopted Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and inflation hedge.

Title: Florida CFO Sees a Potential Growth of the State’s Crypto Portfolio Under a Trump Presidency

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jimmy Patronis predicts an explosive growth of the state’s crypto portfolio under a Trump presidency. Patronis recommended the inclusion of digital assets as the state’s retirement fund as a means of diversification. The CFO highlighted some optimism anticipations via a potential win for Trump in the upcoming elections. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Florida’s CFO, Jimmy Patronis, expressed a strong belief in the possibilities of crypto assets. He mentioned that the state’s crypto portfolio would experience explosive growth under Trump’s presidency. During the discussion, Patronis disclosed that Florida’s retirement fund holds $800 million in digital asset-based investments. However, he believes the state’s digital asset holdings could surge with a pro-crypto US president. Regarding the state’s cryptocurrency portfolio, Patronis said he would “not be shocked to be able to see that growing under a Trump administration.” The CFO said Trump’s victory in the elections will positively impact Florida’s digital asset adoption. The situation will translate to a remarkable spike in crypto-related investments in Florida and the entire country. Further, Patronis advocated that the state should deepen its digital asset engagements. In his recent letter to the executive director of Florida’s State Board of Administration, the CFO recommended Florida’s retirement fund should include more crypto-based investments. Patronis wrote: “As the Chinese Communist Party engages more in the cryptocurrency realm, action is necessary. Trump has mentioned forming a cryptocurrency presidential advisory council and using the US government’s current cryptocurrency holdings to establish a national BTC reserve.” Also, Patronis expressed his eagerness and anticipation for more growth within the digital asset industry if Trump returns to the White House. He slammed crypto skeptics over their negative stance on the assets. He mentioned that those who neglect crypto are making a huge mistake. In addition, Patronis reiterated his commitment to push forward the relevance of crypto inclusion in the state’s investments. He pointed out that the move would come with beneficial results for the state in the long run. Moreover, he noted that great possibilities of cryptocurrency are not just emerging; they are already here. In his campaign, Trump has indicated a more supportive stance for the cryptocurrency industry. He promised to revolutionize the crypto sector in the US and position the country as a global leader in the industry. Moreover, Trump’s team suggested that the Federal Reserve should create a Bitcoin reserve with an annual billion purchases. Amid his bullish stance on crypto, Patronis showed concern regarding the government’s overreach through Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The CFO stated: “We need to be able to have a hedge against this massive overreach by the federal government with a centralized currency.” Besides Florida, some US states, including New Jersey and Wisconsin, have considered the possibilities of crypto investments. In May, Wisconsin acquired 94,562 shares of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) worth almost $100 million. Similarly, in July, New Jersey filed its documents to the SEC to allocate some Jersey City pension fund percentages to Bitcoin ETFs.

Title: AI-Powered Private Credit Will Shape The Future Of Lending
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/donmuir/2024/11/03/ai-powered-private-credit-will-shape-the-future-of-lending/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T23:41:40Z

Creative engineering, vintage illustration of the head of a man with an electronic circuit board for ... [+] a brain, 1949. Screen print. (Illustration by GraphicaArtis/Getty Images) Good times are rolling in private credit: more flexible terms and fewer regulations have made it easier to access and underwrite businesses that have been left behind by old-guard giants like J.P. Morgan. The private credit market, at a projected $1.7 trillion in loan volume for full-year 2024, could more than double to $3.4 trillion in just four years, BlackRock says. It's been headline after headline of multi billion dollar deals into hot companies, and funded by some of the largest asset managers in the world. In July, Ares Management closed on a $34 billion private credit fund, one of the largest ever. In October, Apollo allied with Citigroup to form a $25 billion private lending fund for “strategic transactions,” and it may grow from there. The scale of private credit is extremely vast. Giants serving giants, companies with nine or 10 digits in annual revenue and AUM alike serving one another. In May, Blackstone set up a $7.5 billion debt facility for CoreWeave, an AI hyperscaler with half a billion dollars in annual revenue. Just last week, the Financial Times reported that “once high-flying fintechs” like Klarna, SoFi, and Upstart are “literally passing the buck to private credit” on tens of billions of dollars worth of loans. Headline after headline indeed. There’s a big gulf between the balance sheet of the shiniest of these companies and the lower middle market - companies bringing in even tens of millions annually are often too small and overlooked by these giant lenders. And with commercial banks retrenching from direct lending due to regulatory pressures, rising interest rates, and regional banking volatility, a growing gap has emerged for private credit to fill in the middle market. Running a complex private debt deal takes a lot of man power, but the delta of hours between a $50M process and a $500M process actually isn’t that wide. The credit box is different but the financial analysis is largely the same. I know this firsthand because my company Arc processes hundreds of private credit transactions across this sizing spectrum every quarter. And when I was a private equity associate, the deal teams never exceeded 3 people (Associate, Principal, Partner), whether the equity check was $250 million or $3 billion. Bigger deals take precedent as they require the same amount of time but produce significantly larger payouts for investors. Qualification and underwriting of private debt is labor-intensive and expensive. Managing a portfolio is also operationally onerous. While lower middle market companies can deliver better risk adjusted returns on average with less competitive deal dynamics than their peers upmarket, it’s simply too challenging to deploy capital at scale downmarket for larger funds. Data is unstructured and inconsistent. Deal teams have finite time and resources. Credit analysts can only spend so many hours toiling in data rooms to deliver complex financial analyses and produce credit memos. If a fund wanted to reduce its average transaction size from $250M to $50M, it would need to underwrite at least 5x the volume of deals. Without scalable infrastructure, this means dramatically increasing payroll costs for the fund. This simply isn’t viable. Private credit purveyors need to find new ways to serve these smaller businesses, too. With the adoption of AI, private investors will be able to serve this huge demand without having to double their staff. AI will allow lenders to analyze financial data at a deeper level, faster and more efficiently than ever before. As the technology continues to improve, and is adopted by high-octane private credit funds, they can originate and underwrite more private credit opportunities with the same resources, without sacrificing precision. AI should also reduce loss ratios, based on ever smarter, more comprehensive credit models that become more accurate as they ingest more private company data and performance history. It is difficult to track the precise gains afforded by AI, but here is one hint. Asked whether the private-credit market is a threat to his bank, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said lenders are “providing credit sometimes we can't provide, because of the amount of leverage a fund can take versus us. But what gives us the strength in commercial banking is the customer relationships.” A nice way for a too big to fail bank to politely say that big banks are struggling to keep up. Perhaps BofA should take a page out of Citi’s book and spin up a private credit facility with Apollo or Blackstone to better serve its commercial banking clients? The reality is that we’re seeing the tip of the iceberg. Private credit is already outperforming traditional banks upmarket on megadeals backed by deep-pocketed private investors like Apollo, Blackstone and Golub. When the private credit universe adopts AI en masse, they’ll eat the traditional banks' lunch through the lower middle market as well. This is how ExecThread, a New York-based talent marketplace whose revenue grew eight-fold in a year, was able to line up millions in financing from Decathlon Capital Partners in a matter of weeks. It’s also how IDMission, a Boulder-based Biometric ID software platform with tens of millions in annual sales landed new financing from a private credit fund in just a few weeks. In just the first week, says CEO Ashim Banerjee, he was able to tap a broad network of lenders and compare multiple competitive term sheets and deal structures by leveraging AI. “It gave us the flexibility to choose the optimal deal for IDMission,” he says. These deals were discovered, negotiated, and executed on a new private-credit marketplace: Arc Capital Markets, which my fintech firm launched in January and has since ingested $4 billion in loan volume. Our proprietary software features disruptive AI technology that helps massively accelerate the workflow of private credit lenders. There is an insatiable demand for private credit and a relative shortfall in supply. The advent and adoption of breakthrough technology will help bridge this gap by allowing investment funds to do more with their time. The marriage of AI with private credit will democratize access to the debt capital markets for the middle market businesses who power the US economy. We will go deeper into this, up next.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) Stock: A Risky Bet on Future Promises?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in November. Amid soaring valuations of AI stocks, beginner investors keep wondering whether they are too late to the AI party. However, investing experts believe that opportunities abound in the AI space because of the nature of this technological revolution. While talking to Wall Street Journal during the WSJ Tech Live Conference, venture capitalist Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained why he believes there is no such thing as “too late” when it comes to AI for now. “When it comes to AI, it really feels like the marginal cost of language, reasoning and creation are going to zero. And if that’s the case, this is a supercycle. And if that’s the case, we’ve got decades. So there’s no “too late.” In that sense, we’re still very, very early.” The AI revolution is quickly entering the phase where we are seeing real-life use cases as AI is helping companies significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. According to a detailed report published by Benesch’s AI Commission, an AI-based tool that monitors real-time data from electronic medical records reduced unexpected deaths in hospitalized internal medicine patients by 26%. Casado also talked about the usability of AI models for actual problem-solving: “Everybody looks at the OpenAIs. But as far as value creation and integration, if you look at all the private companies, the smaller companies that are building their own smaller models, they are some of the fastest-growing companies we’ve seen in the history of the industry.” Also Read 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and earnings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 85 Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management recently said the following about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during a program on CNBC: “In the near term, the setup was all about timing, and Elon talked about two years before we see this. You make the adjustment, it is three-plus years away. Also, they didn’t talk about that all-important, more affordable Model 2. I think most people had expected that. The Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) event was indeed short on details. Notably absent was the discussion of a “more affordable” model that Musk had previously mentioned to boost confidence in Tesla’s vehicle sales growth outlook. What about the $30,000 price tag claim? Musk has indicated that the Cybercab will have a production cost of approximately $30,000. Operating within the robotaxi fleet is projected to cost around $0.20 per mile. With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. In contrast, the average price per passenger seat in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s most affordable long-range RWD Model 3—factoring in full self-driving (FSD) licensing—is under $10,000 ($29,990 post-incentive vehicle price plus $8,000 for the FSD license, divided by four passenger seats). Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime. There is a lot of hype around Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) robo taxis but many believe they will not be enough to fix the company’s long-term challenges. What are these challenges? Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) product lineup is showing signs of stagnation, with over 95% of sales still coming from the Model 3 and Model Y. Meanwhile, competitors are rolling out more advanced models. Even Rivian’s CEO suggested Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be nearing market saturation for these models. According to Reuters, Tesla’s market share in Europe is slipping as legacy automakers like BMW post stronger sales. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs. ClearBridge Small Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The strength in the stock market adds significantly to that enormous transfer of wealth, which one could argue is good for shareholders. But is it causal? That is, did the stock market do well because CEOs got large stock grants? Are the CEOs just the lucky recipients of a windfall when the market goes up and their employees perform well? Or do they require huge grants to do their jobs that no one else could possibly do as effectively? Overall, TSLA ranks 10th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in November. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Solventum Corporation (SOLV): A Promising Medical Stock with Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Most Promising Medical Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV) stands against other most promising medical stocks. The healthcare sector depends on medical technology advancements, particularly devices used in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Unlike pharmaceuticals, medical devices work through physical or mechanical means rather than chemical processes. Key products include pacemakers, imaging equipment, dialysis machines, and implants. Like many other industries, the medical device industry was greatly affected by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) segment saw significant revenue growth in 2020 and 2021, mostly due to the increased demand for PCR and fast testing. Overall, even while funding for digital health had been rising gradually in the years preceding the pandemic, it saw a notable uptick in 2021, hitting around $45 billion, more than all of the funds amassed between 2010 and 2017. The global market for medical devices, estimated to be worth $570 billion in 2022, is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching over $996.93 billion. By 2032, the U.S. market is expected to have grown to a value of around $246.51 billion, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%. Key drivers propelling the medical devices market’s expansion in the upcoming years are the rise in demand for cutting-edge treatments and continuous technical developments in medical devices to meet unmet demands in the healthcare industry. The importance of the medical devices sector, which employed over 329,000 people and generated $25.8 billion in payroll in 2020, is highlighted by the U.S. Cluster Mapping Tool. The 2023 EY Medical Technology study highlights supply chain management and financing as two important topics for Medtech leaders worldwide. In 2022, R&D expenditure returned to historical norms, despite reaching a record $24.7 billion. A significant drop in mergers and acquisitions is also noted in the report which indicates a diminished emphasis on inorganic growth tactics. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies have revolutionized patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment in the healthcare industry. Applications of AI include predicting results using electronic health information and evaluating radiological images for early detection. One noteworthy instance was when NVIDIA Corporation and Medtronic announced in March 2023 that they would be integrating NVIDIA’s AI technology into Medtronic’s FDA-approved GI Genius, an intelligent endoscopic module that helps detect precancerous growths. Also Read 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. For our methodology, we began by filtering medical stocks from healthcare equipment ETFs. Next, we identified those with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024, using data from the Insider Monkey database. The final selection was ranked based on the number of hedge fund holders to prioritize stocks with greater institutional interest. “Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).” Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV), a newly independent healthcare company that spun off from 3M in April 2024, develops and sells a wide range of medical products, including wound care, surgical supplies, dental products, healthcare software, and filtration systems. Solventum Corp is implementing a 3-phased approach to stabilize its business, reposition for growth, and optimize its portfolio. Phase 1 involves establishing a new mission, acquiring talent, and restructuring for agility while managing its separation from 3M. As part of the separation, the company is relocating manufacturing lines from 67 plants to 29 Solventum plants, with 2 new facilities under construction. Additionally, Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV) is restructuring its distribution and supply chain by reducing the number of distribution centers from 122 to 73. The rebranding efforts are extensive, covering over 90 countries, and management has adjusted commercial distribution models in more than 60 countries. In Q2 2024, Solventum Corp reported revenue of $2.08 billion. The MedSurg segment grew by 1.8% year-over-year, driven by negative pressure wound therapy and antimicrobial IV site management solutions. However, the Dental segment saw a 2% decline due to volume pressures from challenging market conditions. The HIS segment increased by 3.6%, fueled by the adoption of the 360 Encompass and steady performance management solutions. The Purification and Filtration segment experienced a slight decrease of 0.9%, impacted by performance in drinking water filtration. Overall, SOLV ranks 6th on our list of most promising medical stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SOLV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOLV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Move over swing states: Control of Congress runs through New York — and costs a lot

Published Nov 1, 2024 Modified Nov 3, 2024 Share Published Nov 1, 2024 Modified Nov 3, 2024 Share Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2024. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations What’s it cost to try to win a handful of New York congressional races that could help tip the balance of power in Washington? The answer is $146 million … so far. Democrats and Republicans have zeroed in on six House districts in the Empire State that are potentially up for grabs on Election Day. Most of them are in New York City’s suburbs in the Hudson Valley and Long Island. The political donor class has responded by putting its money where its collective mouth is and pumping tens of millions of dollars into each race. That money has been used to blanket the airwaves in an attempt to influence some of the nation's most consequential House races. Here’s a look at the key New York congressional contests by the numbers. … New York’s sprawling 19th District, which stretches all the way from the mid-Hudson Valley to Ithaca. The bitter rematch between Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro and Democratic attorney Josh Riley has attracted about $41 million in spending so far this cycle, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. That’s the second-highest total in the country, just behind a House race in California, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks election spending. A total of 32 outside groups have put about $27 million into the race, funding a barrage of ads — most of them negative — focusing on immigration, abortion and more. Elsewhere in the state, the Hudson Valley battle between incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Lawler and former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones is also one of the country’s most expensive races, coming in at roughly $36 million. The bulk of the spending — about $90 million — is coming from outside groups, which are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money. The biggest spenders include the Congressional Leadership Fund, a national PAC dedicated to electing Republicans that has spent $25.8 million on the six New York races alone. Its biggest donors include Timothy Mellon, a banking heir and major GOP benefactor, and Kenneth Griffin, the CEO of hedge fund Citadel. The House Majority PAC — a pro-Democrat organization — has spent about $15 million. Its biggest donor is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Battleground New York, a PAC supporting Democrats that is largely funded by labor unions, has spent more than $4 million on the six races; it also spent about $1.6 million on Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who is back on the ballot after winning a key special election to replace expelled Republican Rep. George Santos earlier this year. Suozzi is facing Republican Michael LiPetri. All told, 70 different outside groups have spent at least some money trying to influence the key New York races. That includes groups like Bloomberg’s gun safety organization Everytown, which has spent about $1.6 million supporting Democratic candidates or criticizing their Republican opponents, according to Federal Elections Commission data. On the Republican side, the National Association of Realtors’ PAC has spent about $2.8 million supporting Lawler and Molinaro. Two-thirds of the money has gone toward negative ads or efforts that oppose a candidate. The remaining third has gone to positive ads or efforts that support a candidate, according to the filings. An organized collective of 99 well-heeled donors, most of them from the tristate area, provided a big boost to three New York Democrats in battleground races. It’s called the House Victory Fund, and its donors collectively contributed more than $500,000 each to Jones, Riley and Laura Gillen, a Long Island Democrat challenging Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. It’s a significant chunk of change. In all three cases in New York, the fund is listed as the candidates’ biggest donor, though it’s really a collection of donations. The fund raised more than $8 million from individuals this year – more than $6 million of which came from people who listed a New York address. That includes many Wall Street types, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and a wide array of financiers, executives and employees with various investment funds, as Politico reported earlier this year. Other donors who gave to the national fundraising effort include Laurie Tisch, whose family owns the New York Giants; Kamal Patel, CEO of Ellkay, a health care data management company; philanthropists David and Susan Rockefeller; and Elizabeth Economy of the Hoover Institution. New York City isn’t expected to see any competitive congressional elections this year. So why has a Brooklyn representative raised far more than any other House candidate in the country? Don’t think too hard. It’s House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has more at stake this election cycle than just about anyone not named Trump or Harris. If Democrats win a national majority, Jeffries would be in line to make history as the first Black speaker of the House. He’s raised huge amounts of money to make it happen. That includes a staggering $21.8 million for his individual campaign account, which he’s used to support the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and individual candidates around the country. It’s over $4 million more than current House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, the No. 2 fundraiser. FEC records show Jeffries’ campaign has thousands of individual contributors from across the nation. He’s also received contributions from hundreds of committees controlled by labor unions and special special interest groups — which includes names like CVS Health, SEIU, Deloitte, BlackRock and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC. Aside from Jeffries, two other members of New York state's House delegation cracked the list of top 10 fundraisers this cycle: Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of the North Country ($14 million) and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx ($13.3 million), who both have significant national profiles. There are two key House races on Long Island: The battle for the Suffolk County-based 1st District between GOP Rep. Nick LaLota and Democrat John Avlon, and D’Esposito’s rematch against Gillen, the former Hempstead supervisor, in the 4th District. So far, the Gillen-D’Esposito race has proven to be more expensive — clocking in around $27 million. As the incumbent, D’Esposito’s campaign spending has received recent media scrutiny. A story from CNN raised questions about why his campaign spent more than $102,000 on food and beverages, including more than $23,000 at steakhouses, bars and liquor stores. “The last time I checked, nobody wants to go to political fundraisers at a fast food restaurant. So you need to spend money in order to raise money,” D’Esposito told Gothamist. He said he needed to cultivate new donors to make a successful run in a very competitive district, “and that's what it takes to do it.” Aside from the races in the Hudson Valley and Long Island, the other competitive New York race comes in central New York. That’s where first-term Republican Rep. Brandon Williams is trying to hang on in a race against Democratic state Sen. John Mannion. Brigid Bergin contributed reporting.

Singer takes over Phibsborough pub Pub landlord and music star Gavin James IRISH pop star Gavin James is set to become his native Dublin’s latest celebrity publican. The international chart-topping singer songwriter – famous for hits such as Nervous and Always – is the new proprietor of Doyle’s Corner bar in the city’s northside suburb of Phibsborough. The official opening of the iconic Dublin pub, which dates back to 1873, will be held this coming Wednesday night when the globally famous new owner will pull pints and sing for his customers in a one-off performance. Time Out magazine in recent years named Phibsborough as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, putting it on the map for visitors to the city. Now fans of Gavin James, who also lives in Phibsborough, are set to flock to the area in the hope of meeting the singer in his bar. Gavin James is the new proprietor of Doyle’s Corner bar “This is a really positive story at a time when there is doom and gloom in the Irish hospitality industry with pubs and restaurants closing,” one Dublin businessman told the Sunday World. “More than 2,000 pubs have closed around Ireland since 2005 and it’s a constant struggle for bars and restaurants to stay open due to rising costs of running their businesses.” James, whose fans include Ed Sheeran and James Blunt, joins a string of personalities who own bars around Dublin city. The include a group of former Irish rugby players – Rob and Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O’Brien – who run Lemon & Duke, The Bridge 1859, The Blackrock and Little Lemon. They also recently purchased Ranelagh’s most famous pub, McSorley’s, for €5.5 million. James – real name Wigglesworth – is Dublin city born and reared and grew up on Manor Street. Showbusiness runs in Gavin’s family, as his great grandparents were opera singers, and his grandfather, Jimmy Mac, was a well-known comic in the 1970s. Gavin James on stage His own career in music has come full circle, as he started off singing in the pubs in Temple Bar before hitting the big time. He supported Ed Sheeran at Croke Park and Taylor Swift in London’s Hyde Park and enjoys a huge following around Europe, as well as in Australia and South America. Although he travels the world, James told the Sunday World in a recent interview that his heart is always in Dublin. “I always wanted to do a bit of travelling, but when you’re away you realise you don’t really want to leave for too long,” Gavin said. “I never found a place that felt like home as much as Dublin does. I do like to travel and see foreign places, so I’m very lucky to have the best of both worlds because my career involves a lot of travelling.” Gavin’s manager, Edison Waters, yesterday told the Sunday World that while Doyle’s Corner is not going to be turned into a music bar, there are plans to have singer-songwriters play there at weekends. “Gavin started his own career singing in the pubs, so for people trying to get their leg into the industry there will be no better place to start than in Gavin’s pub,” he said. Trimmed-down singer James, who now maintains a healthy diet and fitness regimen after losing four stone, has never forgotten what it’s like to be a struggling singer-songwriter hustling for support slots on shows by successful bands and artists such as Kodaline and James Blunt in his early years. Kodaline Last year, in association with the mobile network Three, the star took Irish buskers out on his European tour to open his shows. James told the Sunday World how he himself pestered singer Steve Garrigan to bring him on tour with Kodaline. “I annoyed the b*****ks out of him,” Gavin said. “Kodaline were the first people to bring me away. I invited myself on their first UK tour. I wrecked Steve’s head…I kept asking, ‘Steve, can I please come on tour with you?’ And he said, ‘Yeah.’ And then I asked him again and again and again, and he always let me go with them. So thank you, Steve, for that.” Sunday World Newsletter Sign up for the latest news and updates Please check your inbox to verify your details Now download the free app for all the latest Sunday World News, Crime, Irish Showbiz and Sport.

Title: Who are the markets backing in the US election?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Speculators are piling in on the Trump trade, suggesting a Harris victory would come as a surprise For some heavy-hitters in markets, the "worst possible outcome from the US presidential election" is a victory for Kamala Harris, said Katie Martin in the FT. The Democratic candidate's narrowing, or even vanishing, lead in opinion polls – combined with "a big rise in wagers" on her rival in the betting markets – "has been enough to persuade a good chunk of macro hedge fund managers that Donald Trump is on his way back to the White House". For all that, political wonks still reckon the election is a "coin toss" and that betting markets are "unrepresentative and best ignored". BlackRock chief Larry Fink, meanwhile, has argued that the result of the election "really doesn't matter for markets" – a relaxed stance that it's fair to say isn't universal. Many believe that Trump's policies of imposing "aggressive tariffs on imports" and launching "crackdowns on immigration" are inflationary and will have a big effect on bond markets. "For the hedgies holding this view, the Trump trade is very much on." Both long and short-term US bond yields have picked up markedly in the past fortnight: the yield on 10-year Treasuries has risen forcefully higher to around 4.2%. Having been surprised in 2016, "it looks as though the bond market has tried to get that election day jump over with ahead of time in 2024", said John Authers on Bloomberg. But there are some crucial differences. The experience of Trump 1.0 has reduced the "fear of the unknown": the basic outline of what he plans to do is unchanged. "The difference lies in the context." Inflation had been under control for years in 2016 with interest rates "anaesthetised"; now, there's "much less room for manoeuvre". Nor is the "protracted" stock rally that followed Trump's 2016 victory set to be repeated, partly because stocks are at a higher price already. "In the still extremely possible scenario that Harris wins", it would be "great news for European stocks", which would avoid the "numbing effects of Trump tariffs". Escape your echo chamber.

The other big consideration this time, said DealBook in The New York Times, is the influence of "political prediction markets", and whether they have "artificially inflated Trump's odds". One of the most popular platforms, Polymarket, admits that a single French national, with "extensive trading experience", may have been behind some of the largest bets placed. America's bright economic outlook should help Harris in the campaign's closing stages, said The Economist. Growth is holding up well; prices are rising less quickly; consumer confidence is recovering; and the spending power of "ordinary Americans" is increasing. If Trump wins, it will be in spite of – not because of – the state of the US economy.

Title: Fund Tokenization: How Close To The Next Financial Revolution?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/03/fund-tokenization-how-close-to-the-next-financial-revolution/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T06:14:54Z
Full Content:
On October 29, 2024, The Boston Consulting Group, Aptos Labs, and Invesco published a Whitepaper with the title Tokenized Funds: The Third Revolution in Asset Management Decoded. Although the title is interesting and potentially thought-provoking, is there any truth in it? Is fund tokenization the next step in financial evolution, and if so, to what end? (Original Caption) 1889-Trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photograph, 1889. According to the White Paper, fund tokenization (which they call the third revolution in asset management) offers the potential to create billions of dollars of value for both financial institutions and end investors. It claims that in late 2024, tokenized funds had secured more than USD 2 billion in assets under management by BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Even though it is a fraction in comparison to the rest of the AUM by these three entities, this behaviour shows an interest from virtual asset owners. Moreover, more banks seem to roll out tokenized investment funds - the latest has been UBS that released its Money Market Investment Fund Token (uMINT) on November 1, 2024. Fund tokenization is the process of converting ownership of a fund, like a real estate, mutual fund or private equity fund, into digital tokens (on a blockchain). Each token represents a small share or unit of the fund, similar to a stock in a company. Let us compare the company shares and fund tokens: Shares represent traditional pieces of paper or electronic entries within systems managed by stock exchanges or banks. They represent ownership in a company and come with certain rights, like voting on company decisions or receiving dividends. Buying and selling shares usually involves going through brokers, and they’re recorded in centralized financial systems. Business model that has been around for centuries. Now, think of tokens as fully decentralized and digital versions of ownership. They have with similar rights and obligations as the shares, but in their form they are recorded on a decentralized digital ledger. Tokens are different in form because they do not rely on traditional stock exchanges or brokers. Instead, they are fully digital, allowing people to buy and sell them directly, often 24/7, without needing intermediaries. The value of fund tokenization, drawing insights from the BCG Whitepaper and the Bain Company & JP Morgan Analysis, centers on transforming the asset management landscape by creating a more accessible, efficient, and liquid market. Here is a brief overview of the added value: In essence, fund tokenization could offer a significant value by democratizing access, improving liquidity, and increasing efficiency for both investors and asset managers. It positions asset management for future growth, responding to evolving market needs while enhancing investor experience and returns. Potentially, it can also bring more oversigth and trust into the industry. According to InvestaX, certain funds are better suited for tokenization. Particularly, those with high entry barriers, like high minimum investments or geographical restrictions, might benefit from it, as do funds with illiquid assets, such as private equity or real estate. Ideal funds for tokenization include: Investors observe the stock market at an exchange hall on January 6, 2016 in Beijing, China. Before envisioning the next financial revolution, it is also important to recognize the potential risks and limitations of tokenized funds. While neither of the two above mentioned documents address these risks, we should at least consider the following: Tokenized funds represent a fascinating innovation with significant potential value—offering enhanced liquidity, greater accessibility, and operational efficiencies. However, it would be prudent for traditional banks to adopt a more transparent approach regarding the associated risks. A balanced perspective that openly addresses both the advantages and the limitations is essential to build trust among investors and stakeholders. It’s also noteworthy that, just a few years ago, the financial sector largely dismissed crypto assets as speculative or fringe. Now, however, we see major financial institutions not only recognizing but actively embracing the potential of blockchain technology for a range of their own activities. This shift underscores how rapidly perspectives can change, as the underlying technology of digital assets begins to reshape traditional finance in meaningful ways. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast

A top executive of a New York-based global investment firm made an audacious claim that Bitcoin breaching the six-figure price will happen very soon. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said that in the next two years, BTC will be traded at $176,000, joining other crypto investors who believed that the oldest cryptocurrency is ripe for a six-figure price per coin. Scaramucci hailed the alpha crypto asset for sustaining a price surge in only a short period, adding that it sees the digital asset to further surge in the next two years. Scaramucci’s statement was timely as BTC today regained its momentum and once again hit the $70,000 level after the crypto scared many investors as the digital asset slid further down to $68,000 yesterday. According to Scaramucci, he has an ambitious prediction on Bitcoin, saying that by mid-2026, the cryptocurrency will be traded at $176,000. In the previous days, several notable crypto personalities shared the same vision with Scaramucci of the likelihood that BTC will hit the six-figure mark. One of which even predicted a price of $220,000. SkyBridge’s Scaramucci says US will solve debt crisis, bitcoin to triple by 2026 https://t.co/aKYDI6vW2N pic.twitter.com/1BQCdomKHy — Reuters (@Reuters) October 30, 2024 The SkyBridge founder explained that the cryptocurrency could experience a threefold rise in its price in 18 to 20 months, saying that the rally is highly plausible because there is a growing demand for the coin, but the supply is fixed which is the right ingredients for an exponential price uptick. Scaramucci is among the few known crypto investors who announced their support for the presidential candidacy of current US Vice President Kamala Harris. Scaramucci disclosed in previous interviews that Harris would be endorsing Bitcoin once she got elected to the White House. The SkyBridge managing partner has been working closely with the camp of the Vice President to craft policies that will allow cryptocurrency to thrive under her administration. He added that there had been development in Harris’ crypto agenda which he plans to reveal soon. In a separate interview, Scaramucci supported the relationship between gold and Bitcoin, saying that BTC is comparable to gold as an asset. The SkyBridge founder described the firstborn virtual coin as the digital gold of the cryptocurrency world. He noted that other leading financial experts, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, also believe in the Bitcoin-gold comparison, predicting that BTC would reach half of the gold’s market cap. He suggested that it would take Bitcoin about 10 years to attain such a milestone which would greatly benefit its investors since they would get a tenfold return on their BTC investments. At the time of writing, gold is being traded at $2,754 per ounce, a new all-time high, and boasts a market cap of $18.494 trillion.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

These are the favorites mentioned as possible cabinet appointees in Donald Trump’s new administration, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk. Donald Trump appearing before his victory speech. Trump said earlier this month that Kennedy, who has reportedly met privately with Trump transition officials about drawing up plans for a new administration, will have a “big role in health care,” which could involve Kennedy taking a role as a White House czar instead of leading a government agency, four unnamed people familiar with the planning process told the Washington Post. Trump said in September he would create a “government efficiency commission” first proposed by billionaire Elon Musk, who has indicated he would lead the new agency. During an appearance on the Hugh Hewitt Radio Show last month, Trump said he had “four or five good choices” for Defense Secretary, including some names proposed by Hewitt: Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., and Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. There are a few names who are likely being considered to be named Trump’s secretary of state, including Waltz, former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, former U.S. ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell and Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bill Haggerty R-Tenn., according to Politico. Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who dismissed Trump’s classified documents case in July, is among those under consideration for attorney general in a second Trump administration, in addition to former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, former Senate aide and Republican attorney Mike Davis and former White House lawyer Mark Paoletta, among others, multiple people familiar with the matter told ABC News.

Trump has considered naming hedge fund billionaire John Paulson as treasury secretary, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Haggerty, Clayton, Robert Lighthizer, who served as Trump’s top trade official during his first term, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent and Larry Kudlow, the former director of Trump’s National Economic Council, are also likely candidates for the role, Politico reported. Trump reportedly said earlier this week he would install a new cabinet official who would be tasked with cutting the cost of living, though he did not indicate who would take the role. Of the 42 people who worked in Trump’s first administration, 24 endorsed his bid for a second term, according to the Post. Former national security adviser John Bolton has criticized Trump, saying he is “unfit to be president.” Other former Trump officials have advised against electing Trump again, including Trump’s former chief of staff and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, former Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. At an event in Arizona earlier this week, Trump indicated Kennedy would be able to do “anything he wants” and was “going to work on health and women’s health.” Kennedy wrote on social media suggesting a Trump Administration would advise all water systems in the U.S. to remove fluoride from public water—a claim Trump later said “sounds OK to me.” The Post reported Kennedy and his advisers have discussed 30-, 60- and 90-day plans about what they would like to accomplish if Trump is elected, and Kennedy told the outlet that Trump had “asked me to clean up corruption and conflicts at the agencies and to end the chronic disease epidemic.” Howard Lutnick, co-chair of Trump’s transition team, appeared to align with Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, saying it would be “pretty cool” to give Kennedy data to study the effectiveness of vaccines. In his endorsement, Kennedy appeared to reverse his tone on Trump after condemning the former president on several occasions. Text messages obtained by the New York Times showed Kennedy calling Trump a “terrible human being” and “probably a sociopath,” and Trump has called Kennedy a “Radical Left Lunatic.” In 2018, Kennedy denounced Trump’s decision to not probe a link between vaccines and autism in children. During the pandemic, Kennedy was a critic of Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for his recommendations on Covid restrictions. Despite an often bitter back-and-forth, the two have also shared compliments: Kennedy applauded Trump for entering North Korea in 2019 and said he has “really good instincts.” Kennedy announced last April he would seek the Democratic nomination before later deciding to run as an independent.

Title: BlackRock Is Quietly Boosting These 3 Big Closed-End Funds

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured during "Il Salone del Risparmio" at Allianz MiCo on April 10, 2024 in Milan, Italy. "Il Salone del Risparmio" is the Italian largest event in the asset management industry. (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) One often-overlooked way for closed-end funds (CEFs) to give us a profit boost is for management to buy back a fund’s shares. By now, buybacks are probably familiar to most investors: With “regular” stocks, buybacks reduce a company’s share count, which boosts earnings per share and other per-share metrics, indirectly boosting share prices along the way. With CEFs, buybacks have a bit of a different effect. With these high-yielding funds, we want to focus instead on how buybacks affect the discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of a CEF’s underlying portfolio). Members of my CEF Insider service know that we love discounts to NAV because they’re the primary indicator of CEF value. We can buy discounted CEFs, then “ride along” as the discount closes, propelling the fund’s price higher as it does. These discounts originate from the fact that CEFs have fixed share counts, so their market prices can—and regularly do—trade at different levels than their portfolios. And they regularly trade at discounts. I’m bringing this up now because back in May we dug into an unexpected move from BlackRock that I said would help put a floor under the firm’s CEF discounts and boost their market prices The move? Early this year, BlackRock announced a program (also known as a “tender offer” because the firm is inviting investors to tender their shares) to buy back shares of 14 of their CEFs at 98% of NAV once a fund’s discount is at or below 7.5% over a three-month measurement period. This is great for investors, since they get to sell their shares to the BlackRock fund at essentially a 2% discount to NAV. If they bought at a bigger discount, that’s instant profit. Since then, we’ve seen some erosion of these funds’ discounts. But more importantly, bigger gains and more downside protection for shareholders. BlackRock CEFs Above we see the moves in the discounts of three BlackRock tech funds since the buyback plan was announced: the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in orange; BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in purple, and the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust (BIGZ), in blue. Two of these funds, BST and BSTZ, are CEF Insider holdings. In this chart, we can see that BST has stayed at around a 5% discount on average. That’s easily explained by the 7.5%+ discount limit on BlackRock’s buyback program. BST simply hasn’t been eligible. But that’s a good thing—it means BST’s discount hasn’t moved below 7.5% in a sustained way, so investors who buy more when it flirts with such a discount have seen less volatility. The buyback program, however, has helped BIGZ much more; its market price (in purple below) has soared since news of the plan broke, far outstripping its nearly flat total NAV return (in orange). BIGZ Total Returns If we stop to ponder this, we can see how successful BlackRock’s plan has been. This year has been great for stocks, and for growth stocks, in particular, so BIGZ’s NAV should be soaring. Instead, its NAV has flatlined, which should result in investors exchanging the fund for something better, like BST, which has seen its market price–based return (in purple below) and its NAV return (in orange) rise in the last six months: BST Total Returns But remember, BST isn’t benefiting from the buyback program directly, as its discount isn’t big enough. This explains why the NAV and price returns are close to each other. Out of this trio, the fund that’s benefiting the most from the tender offer is BSTZ: BSTZ Total Returns As BSTZ’s discount has shrunk from 17% to around 10% as of this writing, the fund’s 9.7% total NAV return (in orange above) has been significantly compounded, giving investors a 19.4% return, based on the fund’s market price (in purple). This is why I urged CEF Insider members to buy BSTZ in the May issue, after the tender offer was announced. With BSTZ’s discount still around 10%, there’s a ways to go for investors to buy into this fund and profit from the real floor for BSTZ’s discount: 7.5%. Before we go further, it’s worth bearing in mind the two reasons why we love CEFs: the high yields—of course! (BSTZ yields an outsized 12.8% today, while BST yields 8.3%) and their steep discounts to NAV. But bear in mind that a steep NAV discount is great for buying, not so much for selling. That’s why we want our CEFs’ discount to NAV to fluctuate a fair bit, so we can sell at a narrower discount and take profits. Buyback programs can play a role here: BlackRock’s approach allows the fund’s manager to buy back any shares owned by investors in the fund at a fixed discount, as mentioned, so investors who wish to walk away from the fund have better odds of doing so while making a quick profit. But investors who stay in the fund also benefit, because the fund essentially gets to retire those shares at a discount. And the 2% discount accrues to shareholders, so the NAV of the overall fund goes up a bit. For instance, if you buy BSTZ today at a 10% discount and sell at a 2% discount, that’s an instant 8.8% profit. Bear in mind, though, that BlackRock’s program is highly competitive, as the company is only offering buybacks of up to 2.5% of outstanding shares per quarter, so you’ll need to contact your broker ASAP to benefit. All in all, the BlackRock program is great for shareholders of BIGZ, BST and BSTZ, but I do worry that it seems to be offsetting lackluster performance at BIGZ. The market isn’t really in a mood to care, as it’s riding the buyback train, so if there’s a turnaround in BIGZ’s NAV, this fund could soar.

You’d hardly notice, then, that it was one of the worst weeks ever for America’s top crypto employers. On Tuesday, Ethereum software giant Consensys laid off 20% of its global workforce. Hours later, DYdX, a New York-based decentralized crypto exchange, cut its team by 35%. The next morning, Kraken, one of America’s largest crypto exchanges, slashed its headcount by 15%. Rounding out the week, Coinbase reported a disappointing Q3 that missed targets, and an overall decline in customer activity. What gives? Experts told Decrypt a multitude of factors may be at play—ranging from shorter term election- and regulation-related anxieties that may resolve soon, to more existential issues concerning the place for crypto-native companies in an industry increasingly populated by traditional finance giants. “This is definitely the most bearish bull market of all time,” Alex Tapscott, managing director of digital assets at Ninepoint Partners, told Decrypt. While rosy headlines about crypto’s rising tides may appear omnipresent, that narrative really only pertains to Bitcoin, which is more than ever “in a league of its own,” Tapscott said. And even Bitcoin’s strength is no longer necessarily the crypto industry’s gain. “Yeah, Bitcoin’s price went up a lot, but where did that inflow go?” Owen Lau, a senior analyst at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co., told Decrypt. “It's going into traditional finance companies, as opposed to crypto-native companies.” With Wall Street titans like BlackRock scooping up billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin trades through its exchange-traded fund thanks to brand trust and rock-bottom fees, crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are getting left out in the cold, Lau said. Companies tied to sagging cryptocurrencies like ETH—such as Consensys—are faring even worse, he added. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt, which is editorially independent.) Fears related to regulatory uncertainty and the looming presidential election may also be playing a substantial role in chilling crypto activity and investment—at least for the moment. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a leading crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt that while she is optimistic that both a Trump and Harris administration look poised to bring regulatory clarity and support to crypto, the current U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s hostility to the industry has done substantial damage to business that won’t be remedied until next year at the earliest. “A lot of the capital, I think, is sitting on the sidelines, and is nervous about coming into this space until they see some more clarity,” Smith said. “So I do think the regulatory issues and the political issues are a big factor in all of this.” Earlier this week, the Blockchain Association launched an initiative to track how much money leading crypto firms have spent on lawsuits initiated by the SEC. It says that figure is already in excess of $400 million. On Tuesday, when Consensys announced it would lay off 20% of its staff, the company’s CEO, Joe Lubin, said the staff cuts were linked to the “many millions of dollars” Consensys has spent defending itself against the SEC in court. And yet, some experts insist crypto’s woes won’t fade away even if the U.S. government embraces the industry. Oppenheimer’s Lau thinks the current landscape of crypto-native companies—particularly centralized exchanges—is much too overcrowded, and that many such companies will end up either dying out or getting acquired by traditional finance firms. “I don't know why the market would allow 200 exchanges in the world,” he said. “It doesn't make sense to me.” Ninepoint’s Tapscott, meanwhile, thinks it’s going to take a lot more than getting rid of SEC Chair Gary Gensler to unleash a true crypto bull market. “It’s not just the election,” he said. “If you look at previous cycles, there’s always been some set of new applications or capabilities that got people really excited.” Tapscott points to the landmark innovations of decentralized applications (dapps) or NFTs, both of which propelled crypto markets to then-unprecedented highs. “This time around, is there something that has galvanized people in quite the same way?” he said. “I think the answer is, not yet.” While the prospect of politicians and Wall Street embracing crypto is certainly exciting, Tapscott added, that development has not been sufficient to kickstart a true industry-wide bull run—and can’t replace the zeal generated by a bonafide new use case for blockchain tech. “How do you do something with the technology that wasn’t possible before?” he said.

Title: Inflation isn't going anywhere, and higher rates could spark a 12% downturn for stocks in the coming year, veteran strategist says

Households and companies may be breathing a sigh of relief as borrowing costs move lower, but they shouldn't get comfortable because rates and inflation are going to remain high — and that reality could spark a big drop for stocks in the next year, Wall Street veteran Bill Blain said. Blain, a longtime strategist and principal of Wind Shift Capital Advisors, said he sees a rocky 12 months ahead for the stock market. He said the Fed isn't poised to take interest rates as low as markets think, and borrowing costs could indeed rise from here. That could crimp lending, slow dealmaking, and take US and global stocks down 7%-12%, he told Business Insider in an interview. "I think the crunch that we face is what happens when interest rates start to rise, and governments are not in a position to continue boosting the economy in an interest rate rising environment because they've lost the support of markets," Blain said. In the event of a credit crunch, he doubts the US will be able to dole out stimulus as it did during the pandemic, due to concerns about the overall level of debt and the inflationary impact on the economy. "It's the reality that inflation is going to creep back into the global economy. Interest rates are going to have to rise," he said. Blain's forecast may sound counterintuitive to investors who have been pricing in ambitious rate cuts from the central bank. But the US economy faces too many inflationary pressures over the medium-term to warrant aggressive policy easing, Blain said. For one, the federal debt has swelled to a historic $35 trillion. Economists have flagged rapid government borrowing as a factor that risks stoking inflation. Meanwhile, supply chain issues linger, and given rising geopolitical tensions, world trade looks on track to be more fragmented, which can also prop up inflation. Finally, the threat of high tariffs from former President Donald Trump would impose a tax on nearly all imported US goods that economists say would end up being passed on to the consumer. "I think inflation is going to be more ingrained, as it was in the 1970s and early '80s," Blain said. "It's going to be a very, very different economy and we just need to get used to it." Other forecasters have warned inflation could be much stickier than markets expect. Core inflation is unlikely to fall back to the Fed's 2% target, BlackRock strategists said in a recent note, pointing to large US budget deficits and other "mega-forces" that will propel prices higher. That means investors waiting for a return to near-zero borrowing costs to return will be in for a rude awakening. Blain thinks interest rates will hover between 4.5%-6% in the "new normal," causing interest payments to "go through the roof" when compared to pre-pandemic levels, he said. Companies could take a hit as the credit crunch plays out. Though Blain said he wasn't necessarily calling for a market crash or a wave of "zombie" firm failures, he thinks dealmaking in the private equity space could slow, while some of the most financially troubled firms risk insolvency. Meanwhile, stock prices will head back to a much more reasonable level as the speculative bubble in asset prices pops. "I think there's still a massive hangover from the 2010 to 2022 era of ultra-low interest rates and easing and I think stocks are generally still priced for speculation and lower interest rates," he said of his predicted downside to the market. "I don't think there's any reason to really expect major interest rate cuts." Still, investors are feeling pretty positive about the short-term outlook for stocks and lower rates. Markets see a 95% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points at the November policy meeting, and a 72% chance that rates will be 50 basis points lower by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Title: Former Disney Exec Blames Hollywood's Collapse on Woke DEI Policies Forced by Investment Firms
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/11/02/former-disney-exec-blames-hollywoods-collapse-on-woke-dei-policies-forced-by-investment-firms/
Time Published: 2024-11-02T11:14:58Z
Full Content:
Ex-Walt Disney TV executive Monica Harris is blaming Hollywood’s collapse on high-dollar investment firms for forcing the woke DEI initiatives that have driven customers away. Harris noted that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) ideas have flooded Hollywood from the writer’s rooms to the board rooms, and the agenda has become far more important than the products Hollywood is producing, according to The Park Place. Harris pointed to how many corporations are failing so badly, with companies such as Target, Kellogg’s, and others suffering boycotts and loss of revenue thanks to the indulgence of woke, DEI policies. And she said Hollywood is suffering the same short-sighted obsession over such policies. “I think very much the same is true in Hollywood. DEI has swept through that place,” Harris explained. “The Academy Awards, the nominations are only available to films that hit certain quotas, right? You have to have a certain number of people who are black or BIPOC, trans, non-binary, whatever. It’s totally the antithesis of what artistic work is about.” So, why do they do it? Because they are being controlled by the people who control the money, according to Harris. “I’ve noticed this is happening because the same core group of companies are largely funding or have shareholder stakes, majority shareholder stakes in Fortune 500 companies and in the S&P 500. We’re talking about BlackRock. We’re talking about Vanguard. We’re talking about State Street,” she said. “When those three companies and their subsidiaries dominate Boards of Directors and dominate the ownership of stock, then they literally are in the position to tell these companies to adhere to whatever guidelines they’d like,” she continued. “So if DEI is an initiative that these majority shareholders would like companies to pursue, that’s what they’ll pursue. Because if not, then they’ll face the wrath of the people who can yank the money, yank the loans, yank the funding, because it’s all about money.” Harris suggested the leaders of companies such as Disney are torn between two conflicting positions because of this setup. “So at the end of they day you’re in — if you’re a CEO, you’re like, ‘Do I piss off my consumer base and maybe hope I can massage them, or do I piss off the people who are actually funding me?’ And they’re between a rock and a hard place,” she explained. “But they have to do this because… if they don’t adhere to these guidelines those loans, that funding is going to be yanked,” she said. “So again, they are between a rock and a hard place. That’s the untold story, in my opinion.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has basically confirmed Harris’s opinion. In a 2017 interview, he bragged about “forcing behaviors” on companies. “Well, behaviors are going to have change. And this is one thing that we’re asking companies. You have to force behaviors. And at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors. 54% of the incoming class are women,” Fink said. “We added four more points in terms of diverse employment this year. And what we are doing internally is if you don’t achieve these levels of impact, your compensation could be impacted. You have to force behaviors. And if you don’t force behaviors — whether it’s gender, or race, or just any way you want to say the composition of your team, you’re going to be impacted.” Meanwhile, Hollywood’s revenues are tumbling fast. And Disney, in particular, has been hard hit by its dwindling customer base. That state of affairs has caused the company to begin seriously contracting, closing down departments, and laying off thousands of employees. According to her LinkedIn work history, Harris worked for Disney from 1998-2000, long before its current woes.

Title: What happened in crypto this week?
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/what-happened-in-crypto-this-week-2/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T22:58:03Z

It’s been another busy week in crypto: Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is planning to launch a stablecoin, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hit $30 billion in assets in 293 days, ex-FTX executive Nishad Singh avoided prison, and Immutable received a Wells notice from the SEC. Let’s take a closer look at these and give you a recap on what happened this week in crypto. With the US election drawing closer, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial project plans on entering the crypto market by linking a stablecoin to the US dollar. The news of this comes as the project raised $14 million in initial funding; however, despite intentions to capitalize on the growing demand for stablecoins, the project saw limited success, falling short of its $300 million token sale. On top of that, shortly after the sale went live, the platform’s website crashed and even though 100,000 people signed up, only 6,832 unique wallets hold WLFI tokens, according to Etherscan. With only a few days until election day, if Trump does become the US President again, he would hold significant influence over the regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins, which could be a pivotal move for the future of WLFI. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has set a new record, reaching $30 billion in assets in 293 days. By doing so, it surpasses gold, which did it in 1,790 days and JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ($JEPI), which did it in 1,272 days. BlackRock holds more than 433,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.5 billion, according to iShares data. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million in shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. With the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs, they now have over one million in Bitcoin holdings and could soon pass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin. 12,000 btc a day keeps the doctor away lol. At this rate they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they? https://t.co/dLVNsjMlxK — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Earlier this week, Nishad Singh, the former engineering director of crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release in a federal court in New York. Judge Lewis Kaplan said, “this may have been one of the biggest crimes in American history.” Kaplan also noted that Singh’s involvement appeared limited compared to FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Due to “substantial assistance” from Singh, his lawyers argued for a lenient sentence. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and Ellison is expected to surrender by November 7 and was sentenced to 24 months in prison. As the crackdown on FTX executives continues, Singh is the fourth former executive to receive sentencing, with co-founder Gary Wang set to face court on November 20. Blockchain gaming platform Immutable has become the latest to receive a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging securities laws violations. According to Immutable, nothing was specified in the notice; however, it believes its “claims are targeting the listing and private sales of IMX in 2021.” Immutable has said they are confident that the IMX token is not a security. Immutable said the Wells notice before the US election illustrates why the “industry is so skeptical of any attempts from this SEC to argue it is attempting to provide clarity.” “Prior to the issuance of a Wells notice, there are often multiple months of interviews and conversations between company counsel and the SEC, so the SEC can fully understand the situation,” Immutable added. “Instead, in our very first interaction with the SEC, we were told a Wells notice would be issued to the company within the week. We then received it within hours.” Immutable joins a list of companies in the crypto industry that have faced or are facing lawsuits against the SEC. Other crypto organizations that have received a Wells notice from the SEC include Coinbase, Crypto.com, and OpenSea.

Title: Vivek Ramaswamy’s anti-DEI, pro-Bitcoin financial services company moving HQ to Dallas

businessBanking By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter Strive Enterprises, a financial services company co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced Friday that it will move its headquarters to Dallas. In a press release, the company said it expects most of its staff will move to Dallas from its current Columbus, Ohio headquarters by the end of Q1 2025. It is also launching a wealth management division — to be focused on “integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios” — to complement its existing asset management platform. Founded in 2022, Strive currently has $1.7 billion in assets under management and seeks to combat, “social and political agendas” in the financial world, according to its website. The site names DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and ESG (environmental, social and governance; sometimes called impact investing) initiatives as particular concerns. Major firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and the Dallas area’s own Charles Schwab, all with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, incorporate DEI and ESG strategies. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “When Strive launched in 2022, nearly every major corporation bent the knee to ESG,” Ramaswamy said in the release. “Just two short years later, the national environment has changed dramatically, in no small part due to Strive’s efforts. The moment is now ripe to launch a pro-capitalism Wealth Management business focused on true financial freedom, with a focus on integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios.” Governor Greg Abbott points to Strive’s relocation as the latest development in the growth of Y’all Street, the nickname given to Texas’ booming financial sector. “Texas has become the home of capital in the United States,” Abbott said in the release. “With the Best Business Climate in the nation and as the top state for corporate relocation and expansion projects, Texas is the future hub of capital markets that will help cement our economic power on the global stage.” Ramaswamy rose to national prominence during his run for the Republican presidential nomination throughout 2023. Having launched pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences in 2014, Ramaswamy billed himself as an “anti-woke” entrepreneur and drew attention for controversial pitches such as those to shut down the Department of Education, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After taking fourth in the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign in January 2024. He has since been on the campaign trail for former President Donald Trump, and has stated interest in Ohio’s governorship and Senate seat, as well as in a potential Trump cabinet seat. Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News. She has previously worked for the news department at Car and Driver magazine and served as the sports managing editor of The Duke Chronicle.

Title: The Regime Goes After Elon Musk

This is a lightly edited transcript of the accompanying video from professor Peter St. Onge. Recently, Elon Musk gave a talk detailing the government attacks on his companies since he came out as pro-free speech and, especially, since he came out as pro-Donald Trump. These include endless made-up environmental rules—including a study to see if falling rockets hit sharks. It includes curbs on SpaceX launches specifically because Elon tweets pro-Trump things. And it includes a $600,000 fine for spilling … drinking water in a desert. Not a joke. Attacking dissident companies, of course, is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. As Mussolini put it, “everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.” For a true authoritarian no citizen is allowed to dissent—and certainly no companies, which are sitting ducks. Of course, in theory, this sort of thing doesn’t happen in America. In theory, we jail bureaucrats who conduct Mussolini-style lawfare. Alas, it has been going on ever since the progressives imposed the administrative state about a hundred years ago. Saddling now every industry in America with a regime Big Brother, a library worth of regulations, mandates, licensing boards—a bureaucratic army that, like everything government does, is thoroughly corrupt. Still, before Donald Trump there was some independence. CEOs could still criticize regime shibboleths like mandatory racism—er, affirmative action—or transvestites in girls’ locker rooms if anybody had been dumb enough to propose that in 2015. Sadly, that all changed as authoritarian Borg went to war with Trump, culminating in the reign of terror during COVID-19 that snuffed out the slightest hint of disloyalty with an enthusiasm that would make North Korea blush. We saw it in living color during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots. Historically, about 70% of Fortune 500 CEOs vote Republican. Meaning that, statistically, at least 70% of them were probably horrified by BLM’s orgy of city-burning and murder. And yet not one Fortune 500 CEO spoke up. Now, you might say that’s because most are spineless cowards, and that’s true. But look at it from their perspective: You’re entrusted with tens of thousands of employees, and if you speak up, rioters will come beat them, burn their workplaces, and put them out of a job and your shareholders out of a retirement account. You could, like Elon, be targeted by hundreds of regulators—even prosecutors in blue cities—hunting with a fine-tooth comb for some way, any excuse, to destroy the entire company. For a CEO with a legal duty to protect the company—and a moral duty to protect employees—it’s simply too risky. So, they shut up. To be sure, many indulged, enthusiastically jumping on the institutionalized racism of DEI or cutting checks to the very rioters burning cities—in fact, BLM cashed more than $50 billion in corporate donations. Not since Genghis Khan has burning a city been quite so profitable. But others never drank the Kool-Aid. They may have opposed the Left with every fiber of their being. But they were held hostage by rioters, prosecutors, regulators, even financiers like BlackRock. So, what’s next? The solution is very easy: Get rid of the administrative state. Lay off the hundreds or thousands of little Mussolinis populating every regulatory agency from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Supreme Court laid the groundwork earlier this year with its Loper Bright decision clipping bureaucrats’ wings. And Musk himself has been floated by Trump for a blue-ribbon panel slashing government waste and corruption. The final step is Congress sitting down and actually defunding these agencies. Zero them out. Return the money to the people. Return the bureaucrats to jobs that don’t involve extortion. And let Americans get back to exercising our rights without being destroyed.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi’s holdings ‘in less than two weeks’ – Analyst

Spot BTC ETFs have amassed over 50% of the assets held by Gold ETFs in just 10 months. Less than a year post-launch, U.S. Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC. This is significant as just recently, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, had predicted that the ETFs could surpass the holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator – Satoshi Nakamoto. At the time, he had projected that this would happen by mid-December. However, BlackRock’s single-day purchase of 12,127 BTC, according to Lookonchain, has hastened the timeline. Balchunas reacted to this massive accumulation on X, stating, “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” At press time, BlackRock held 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $30.8 billion. Combined, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now manage assets totaling $70.86 billion, representing 5.12% of Bitcoin’s market cap. This, according to data from Soso Value. For context, Nakamoto holds an estimated 1.1 million BTC, currently worth $76 billion. Previously, AMBCrypto reported that on 30 October, BlackRock’s IBIT marked its largest single-day inflow since January. This surge in investment followed a trend of daily triple-digit total net inflows since 23 October. Source: Soso Value However, daily total net inflows dipped to $32.14 million on 31 October. Moreover, only IBIT and the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF (BRRR) brought in $318.80 million and $1.89 million, respectively. Other ETFs saw either outflows or no inflows at all. Interestingly, this drop coincided with the king coin losing its standing over the $70,000-level. Despite this decline, however, Balchunas revealed that IBIT managed to attract more cash than the total of 13,227 ETFs worldwide over the past week. He emphasized that this achievement is particularly significant for an ETF that is still under a year old. Source: Eric Balchunas/X IBIT’s remarkable performance didn’t go unnoticed by industry experts. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared his perspective on X: “This thing is turning into a $$$ vacuum cleaner.” Geraci highlighted that BTC ETFs’ $70 billion in assets was more than 50% of the $130 billion held by gold ETFs since 2004—All within just 10 months of their 2024 launch. Quinten Francois, Co-founder of WeRate, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Bitcoin ETFs had more inflows in the last 2 days than the Gold ETF took in during its entire first year.” Meanwhile, the Uptober rally came to an end with BTC’s 16th anniversary, marking the day Nakamoto released the nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This milestone laid the foundation for a decentralized digital currency and the cryptocurrency era. Interestingly, on its anniversary, Bitcoin dipped below the $70,000-mark. At press time, it was valued at $69,821, down by 3.33% over the last 24 hours. While the downturn may have disappointed some, it also poses an intriguing question – Could this be an opportunity for institutional investors to “buy the dip” and takeover Nakamoto sooner than expected?
