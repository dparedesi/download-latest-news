Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT DULUTH — As a potential sale of Minnesota Power looms, a crowd of concerned citizens gathered at the company’s doorstep Wednesday afternoon to voice their concerns. On Sept. 25, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to begin weighing whether to approve a $6.2 billion purchase of the Duluth-based utility by BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners with help from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. ADVERTISEMENT Jenna Yeakle, a Sierra Club staff member, told crowd members Wednesday: “I’m here with you all today to push back against this story that we have been told by Minnesota Power and their potential buyers that they need to be scooped up by BlackRock in order to achieve a carbon-free energy picture." To the contrary, Yeakle suggested the acquisition “could slow much-needed climate action and actually threaten our democracy.” But the utility would really benefit from some outside support to achieve its reduced-emission goals, according to Jen Cady, vice president of regulatory affairs for Allete Inc., Minnesota Power’s parent company. “The scale of what’s in front of us is really unlike anything the company has had to navigate in the past,” she said. Cady noted that Minnesota Power expects it will need to spend $5 billion in the next five years — a sum greater than it has had to raise in the past 75 years. “And these are the right partners to help us navigate that future,” she said. Cady also pointed out that Minnesota Power will continue to be governed by the state PUC and will need to justify any proposed future rate increases, regardless of its ownership. ADVERTISEMENT But Buddy Robinson, a member of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota who addressed the crowd as an individual Minnesota Power ratepayer, advised that the state PUC pay heed to a July 15 recommendation by an administrative law judge suggesting the acquisition should be blocked for not being in the public interest. “The key fact established in the proceedings is that BlackRock and CPP, as private equity companies, intend to increase rates faster than would happen otherwise,” he said. Robinson said this is the same reason large customers, including taconite and paper producers, have also lined up against the sale. He said that the economic power of BlackRock “boggles the mind,” with a portfolio of $11 trillion in assets — greater than the gross domestic product of all nations, except the U.S. and China. Angel Dubrow, another concerned customer and landlord, suggested higher electricity costs could drive up housing costs that are already unaffordable for many residents, especially as BlackRock and its partners seek to recoup a $1.5 billion premium they have offered to purchase Allete, above its market valuation at the time of the deal. But Cady predicted the new ownership would bring greater stability to Allete and its subsidiary, Minnesota Power. She noted that the company already is publicly traded on Wall Street, with its value largely determined by investors making quarter-to-quarter financial decisions. “Infrastructure funds and pension funds are inherently long-term investors,” she said. “They are looking to provide stable returns over a long period of time. And that investor expectation is much more closely aligned with the utility business, where we build big infrastructure that serves customers for decades.” ADVERTISEMENT Over the past 16 months, Cady said Allete has listened and worked to address customers’ concerns, signing an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that contains about 70 commitments, including a one-year base-rate freeze. Unfortunately, that agreement was signed just before the administrative law judge handed down her recommendation, and Cady suggested a close reading might have changed the outcome. “I don’t think the judge had adequate time to really evaluate all of the components of that settlement before her report was due,” she said, contending that the issues raised were pretty comprehensively covered. Yet, state Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, says her fears have not been allayed. “This proposed sale does affect the entire community,” she said. “The BlackRock Corp. controls trillions of dollars of assets internationally," she said. "So, when they become a 60% majority owner of our electric utility, the financial decisions they’re making — whether they be about business strategy, expansion, compliance with our clean energy laws here in the state of Minnesota, whether they honor union contracts, how they treat their workers, whether they go for a rate increase or how much — all of those decisions are going to also be affected by the forces that are coming down on that corporation from their international interests." McEwen predicted this structure would lead to “an inevitable conflict of interest.” ADVERTISEMENT “It is not always going to be in the financial interests of BlackRock to keep our rates as low as possible, to serve our community the electricity we need,” she said. “That’s not the business they are in. They are in the business of making profit from as many things as possible." ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Title: Coinbase Wallet Shows Massive XRP Cuts, What’s Going On?

Time Published: 2025-09-03T22:00:23Z
Full Content:
Data shows crypto exchange Coinbase has made a surprising shift in its XRP holdings by reducing its stash from more than 780 million XRP to around 200 million in a matter of weeks. According to data from XRPScan, Coinbase’s total XRP holdings have fallen by a massive 69% from its most recent proof of reserve report. Notably, this cutback comes at a time when institutional players like BlackRock are increasingly intertwined with Coinbase’s operations Once the fifth-largest exchange holder of XRP, Coinbase has now slipped to tenth place after reducing its balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This represents a staggering 69% reduction since the second quarter of 2025, with a 57% plunge in just the past month. Such a huge cutback in Coinbase’s XRP holdings within a short period of time can only be attributed to outflows from institutional investors. At the time of writing, Coinbase has 11 cold wallets remaining, each holding 16.5 million XRP tokens. This is a massive fall from early June numbers of 52 cold Coinbase wallets holding a total of 970 million XRP, according to XRPwallets, an XRP commentator account on the social media platform X. Interestingly, XRPwallets also hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. BlackRock is a suspect due to the nature of its recent collaboration with Coinbase. That collaboration, which was announced in early August, was done to allow institutional investors easy access to digital assets directly through Coinbase. Although Bitcoin was initially the focus, the partnership has most likely expanded to XRP due to its growing demand among institutional investors. Right now, all that’s left in Coinbase’s XRP wallets might be mostly XRP held by retail traders. XRPwallets also speculated that other major exchanges, such as Uphold, Binance, and Upbit, could eventually show similar balances, around 200 million XRP each, once Ripple’s distributions move through the system. By their estimates, this would leave about 1 billion XRP across exchanges and another 900 million resting in retail cold wallets. Although the numbers were framed as guesses, they relate to the idea that institutional channels are absorbing XRP, leaving exchanges increasingly as platforms for retail activity. Interestingly, other crypto exchanges like Upbit and Uphold have also seen their XRP holdings fall massively within the same time period as Coinbase. Upbit, for instance, saw its XRP balance fall from 6.03 billion XRP to 5.84 billion XRP. Uphold, on the other hand, saw its XRP balance fall from 1.907 billion XRP to 1.746 billion XRP. XRP is still trading below the $3 resistance level after repeated rejections this month, which has left the crypto’s near-term trajectory in question. Reduced exchange balances often point to decreasing sell pressure, which could help support price stability. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, up by 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Last year's win against New Zealand took more out of Brittany Hogan than she had ever experienced in her rugby career. If Ireland are to pull off a repeat of last year’s epic win this weekend, she knows it will take even more. It’s not hyperbole. The stats back it up. Hogan made 19 tackles that night in Vancouver, more than any other Irish player, while only Niamh O’Dowd and Aoife Wafer logged more carries. "I always say that when we played New Zealand last year it was the hardest game I've ever played in my life," the Ireland number 8 said ahead of Sunday’s Rugby World Cup Pool C decider against the Black Ferns (2.45pm, live on RTÉ). "We all are all well aware that we're going to have to go to the well at the weekend, so we're fully prepared to have a big shift." The 26-year-old (below) has had to go to the well already in this World Cup. After a player of the match display against Japan, she was named among the replacements for last Sunday’s game against Spain, and was called in after just over 20 minutes when Sam Monaghan departed with a hip issue, but led Ireland with 14 carries despite only playing 56 minutes. The games are only getting tougher, with the defending champions this weekend followed by a quarter-final, and if they win that they’ll be staying in England for two more matches. Hogan insists there’s still plenty of petrol left in the tank. She said: "To be fair, it was a very high ball-in-play game [against Spain]. And Spain had so much possession on pick and goes, you just rack up tackles, you rack up those meters." With 36 caps to her name, the Blackrock and Ulster back row has been one of Scott Bemand’s most trusted forwards since he took charge two years ago, in part down to her ability to move between number 8 and blindside flanker. Wafer is yet to appear at this World Cup, so Hogan has been leaned on heavily across both sides of the ball in the opening two games, leading Ireland’s tackle (34) and carry (26) charts, while her 120 carry metres are the highest of any forward in the squad. "I've been trying to put myself into more of a ball carrying role because that's just the way that my game has developed," she said. "It's become sort of a strength of mine that the team and the coaches like to utilise. "So that comes hand in hand with [Aoife] Wafer, and if I have to latch Wafer, no problem. She's an incredible asset to our team. "Whenever she's gone, if I have to have a couple more carries I will, but we are spreading that across the team pretty well. "[It has been] organic, it just comes with my physical adaptations the past year and my awareness of the game and trying to just put my hand up and say, 'I'm carrying’ and people come around me. "I love carrying the ball. Give it to me any day. I'll do it. No problem." Almost a year on from that thrilling 29-27 win against New Zealand, the memories are still as vivid as ever. "It is going to be like that, essentially like a Croke Park feeling for these girls"@HannahOConnor22 on the unique vibe that will wait Ireland against New Zealand at Brighton's Amex Stadium #RWC2025 📺/🎧 #RTERugby Podcast: https://t.co/DbbgFFNsnf pic.twitter.com/EfLVo77Rut "The scrum in the midfield," Hogan said, when asked for her abiding memory. "And just saying to girls, all of us looking each other in the eyes and saying, ‘Right, New Zealand are going to come for us here, lock in and give it absolutely everything that you can’. "That moment and then Dannah [O’Brien] kicking it off, and just shock and then the changing-room afterwards. "I suppose it kind of kick-started our belief behind the group, behind the girls, behind the coaching staff. "It kick-started the IRFU putting loads more funding, loads more investment into us, everybody was on our train and on our wavelength then. "And I think that just after that New Zealand game, we knew that we could do it internally, but externally I think that just like put a rocket boost behind the team." Twelve months on from providing 2024's biggest shock in rugby, what are the chances they do it again? "We have that belief behind us that we are capable of doing it [again], and we're more than capable of doing it, but we are well aware that New Zealand are a world class outfit and it's going to be an incredibly tough game. "If we come out with the right side of the scoreboard afterwards, great, if we don't, that's fine as well. "But we all have that full belief and confidence that we are going to be able to pack a good performance and hopefully a good show for the crowd. "We know that they are able to show up in these competitions and they always do. I suppose that kind of fear factor wasn't really there [last year]. "We were more underdogs, we kind of had that, well, we've got nothing to lose kind of factor. "We've taken away the element of surprise. So now we just have to work that little bit harder."

Title: Anthropic Rakes in $183B Valuation as It Takes on Musk, Altman

Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude family of models, has secured a $13 billion Series F financing at a staggering $183 billion post-money valuation, nearly tripling its worth since March. Anthropic is backed by AmazonÂ and Google-parent Alphabet. The company said that the round was led by ICONIQ Capital and co-led by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with institutional heavyweights such as BlackRock, GIC, Qatar Investment Authority, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Coatue among the backers. âWe are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,â Anthropic Chief Financial OfficerÂ Krishna Rao said in a statement. âThis financing demonstrates investorsâ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.â In early 2025, Anthropicâs valuation stood at $61.5 billion following a $3.5 billion Series E round. Since then, the companyâs annualized revenue has surged from $1 billion to over $5 billion, attributed to rapidly growing enterprise adoption of Claude. Claude Code, Anthropicâs developer-focused AI assistant, has become a standout performer, generating more than $500 million in run-rate revenue within just a few months of its May launch. Its usage climbed over tenfold in that time. The company now services over 300,000 business clients, with accounts contributing over $100,000 in annual revenue, increasing nearly sevenfold. Investor enthusiasm remains palpable, pulling in capital from major sovereign wealth funds. The Qatar Investment Authorityâs participation signals growing geopolitical attention on AI infrastructure. Anthropic said it plans to deploy the fresh capital toward three core initiatives: enterprise scaling, AI safety research, and global expansion efforts that reinforce its positioning as a safe and capable alternative to consumer-facing rivals. Anthropicâs skyrocketing valuation underscores how investor appetite for AI overrides the traditional risk calculus. But as a private company far from IPO, questions around future profitability, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive threats, especially from OpenAI, xAI, and others, loom large. Despite the injections of capital and growth signals, the sustainability of ultra-high private valuations in the tech space has come under increasing scrutiny. Anthropic now sits among the most valuable private companies globally and faces pressure to deliver on the lofty expectations that such a valuation implies. OpenAI has secured $8.3 billion in new funding at a $300 billion valuation, part of a broader $40 billion financing drive slated for 2025. The companyâs annual revenue run rates are reported between $12 billion and $13 billion, with projections potentially reaching $20 billion by year-end. OpenAI is also exploring a $500 billion valuation via a secondary share sale for current and former employees, signaling investor enthusiasm for liquidity events. Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI, merged with his social media company X in an all-stock deal that valued xAI at about $80 billion and X at $33 billion, for a combined enterprise valuation of $113 billion. Earlier, xAI had raised $10 billion in debt and equity financing, underscoring Muskâs aggressive push in AI.

Title: SharpLink makes $174 mln Ethereum gamble: Co-CEO warns of risks

SharpLink Gaming cements its second spot among Ethereum treasuries. Can they maintain this momentum? SharpLink Gaming acquired $174M worth of ETH, strengthening its spot among public treasuries. However, Co-CEO Chalom noted the risk associated with these treasury firms. This year alone, Ethereum [ETH] has seen about eleven U.S. institutions adopt ETH strategies, an honor that was initially reserved for Bitcoin [BTC]. On that note, SharpLink Gaming (SBET) took its total holdings to 837,230 ETH. This followed an announcement that they had acquired another 39,008 ETH, valued at $176.4 million. In total, the company added about 397,923 ETH in the last 30 days, per CoinGecko data. Their total holdings were at $3.66B at press time, about 0.694% of Ethereum’s total supply. SharpLink paid an average price of $3,603 per token since their July switch to a public company focused on ETH. The king of altcoin’s price of $4,366 indicated that they were in profits at press time. The firm’s concentration of Ethereum has risen by about 97% since early June. From the data on SharpLink Gaming, the company had earned 2,318 ETH in staking rewards, with their ETH NAV at $3.68 billion. About 860,369 ETH, valued at $3.7B, were waiting to be staked in September. Source; SharpLink Gaming However, despite the acquisition and strong fundamentals, their stock (SBET) continued to decline. The last 24 hours saw a drop of more than 4.71%, as price traded at $16.98, per Yahoo Finance data. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom said that Ethereum was embraced on Wall Street due to its security and liquidity. The staking component ensures the network remains secure, while its wide application across the crypto space offered liquidity. The former Head of Strategies at BlackRock explained that SharpLink raised $400M from Consensys and other institutions investors to buy ETH. They also raise money through an at-the-market program on a daily basis from new equity investors. The Ethereum is staked and provide yield to make it productive. However, Chalom noted the risk associated with ETH treasury firms in case of a massive market downturn. U.S. firms accounted for about 2.68% of the supply. SharpLink was second in terms of holdings, behind BitMine, which had more than double their amount. BitMine’s total was at 1.867 ETH worth $8.167 billion, which represented about 1.547% of total ETH supply. Coinbase, Bit Digital and ETHZilla wrapped up the top five, respectively. The total held by U.S. firms was at 3.233M valued at $14.15B, a 9.9% rise on the day. Source: CoinGecko Other jurisdictions like Hong Kong were also getting on board, with Yunfeng Financial holding about 10K ETH.

Title: Google is feeling lucky after avoiding the worst of the proposed penalties in its antitrust case

Hello there! Frustrated by the increase in tipping culture over the last few years? You're not alone. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said restaurants are "getting the customer to pay" for their workers with tipped wages. In today's big story, a judge ruled on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Google is … feeling lucky? A judge's ruling on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly didn't leave the tech giant unscathed. Still, it largely avoided the severe punishments its prosecutor, the US government, was after. So how was Google punished? -Google can't negotiate exclusive partnerships to be the default search engine. As a reminder, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone to be Safari's default engine. -Google needs to share its search index and user-interaction data with competitors. Rivals will now have the benefit of training up their own models with some of the troves of data Google has collected. -Google has to provide syndication services to competitors looking to establish their own search and ads business. However, it can charge them for it. But it could have been a lot worse. -The judge rejected the biggest penalty prosecutors were after: a forced sale of the Chrome browser or Android operating system. -Google can also keep paying partners like Apple for distribution. The deals just can't be exclusive. -It doesn't need to share its highly valuable ads data with anyone. Don't take my word for it, though. As always, the markets are the true judge. Alphabet's stock rose as much as 8% in after-hours trading. The ruling also came with a unique twist. US District Judge Amit Mehta acknowledged that the fast-paced nature of tech, especially the recent rise of generative AI, had to be considered in the decision. In fact, in a roundabout way, rivals like OpenAI might have actually saved Google from facing far worse consequences, writes BI's Charles Rollet. Depending on who you ask, generative AI is already eating into Google's search business. So while Google has a monopoly now, that might not be the case going forward. The rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude is reshaping the competitive landscape in search. Penalizing Google now could hamstring it at a critical inflection point for tech. A significant gap still exists between a search giant like Google and up-and-coming chatbots. But Mehta acknowledged the AI startups could "end up being game changers." "Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future," Mehta wrote. "Not exactly a judge's forte." 3 things in markets 1. Summer's over. Wall Street is leaving vacation mode and entering a historically weak month for the stock market. That's coupled with a heavy load of economic data that's incoming. Here's what's on investors' radars this week. Meanwhile, investing pros shared four ways they're placing their bets. 2. Tech stocks are having a rough start to the month. The Nasdaq 100 slid as much as 1.9% on the first trading day of September, with heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon suffering steep losses. Investors are grappling with three factors heading into September. 3. Hedge funds are on track for a strong year. Large funds, including $68 billion Citadel, saw positive returns in August, people close to the money managers told BI. Multistrategy hedge fund managers outside the big four are continue their strong year as global stock markets are on rise. 3 things in tech 1. Tesla has a long road to launching Full Self-Driving in Europe. The company has teased a rollout of its driver-assist software for nearly a year. But it faces what Elon Musk has called a "layer cake of bureaucracy": European regulators are moving more slowly and have more testing requirements than their US counterparts.2 2. Cold brews, cryochambers, and baths with Paris Hilton. Carter Reum, who co-founded the VC firm M13 with his brother Courtney, is a big fan of intermittent fasting and cooking simple meals. He walked BI through his daily routine, which always ends by taking a bath with Paris Hilton, his wife, for our Power Hours series. 3. The battle of the LLMs. LMArena, a popular website where enthusiasts can evaluate AI models, recently blew up when Nano Banana went viral for churning out impressive images and photo edits. Now, LMArena has over 3 million monthly, according to CTO Wei-Lin Chiang. BI chatted with Chiang about the top AI models people are using, and more. 3 things in business 1. Welcome to real estate's year of cold feet. Homebuyers are backing out of deals just before the finish line at a record rate. Buyers are growing skittish about the rising costs of home ownership, mortgage rates, and the job market. With more houses available and fewer buyers to compete with, current home buyers can afford to be picky — but that leverage won't last forever. 2. MrBeast's new venture: telecommunications. The world's biggest YouTube creator is looking to start a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, per a leaked investor deck from early 2025 viewed by BI. MVNOs are a popular business strategy among celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, and the move is part of a larger push from Beast Industries to diversify MrBeast beyond media. 3.

September 03, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Etherealize, Inc. Etherealize, Inc. NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Etherealize, the company developing products and infrastructure to onboard institutions to Ethereum, has announced the closing of a $40 million funding round led by Electric Capital and Paradigm. This funding is in addition to a grant received from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation in 2024 to kickstart its operations and educate the financial sector about Ethereum. With this latest raise, Etherealize is strengthening its position at the forefront of innovation on Wall Street and as the definitive builder of institutional-grade settlement and privacy infrastructure for tokenized assets. The team will continue driving institutional adoption of Ethereum by developing: "Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world's most battle-tested, open financial network. This raise kicks off the ‘Institutional Merge'—upgrading institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails," said Danny Ryan, cofounder and President of Etherealize. Etherealize's Mission The company remains focused on two priorities: educating the financial sector on Ethereum's value proposition and rewiring Wall Street with Ethereum's programmable, credibly neutral infrastructure.Co-founded by former Wall Street trader Vivek Raman, former member of Ethereum Foundation leadership and research lead Danny Ryan, and Ethereum veterans Grant Hummer and Zach Obront, Etherealize is on a mission to modernize the legacy financial system with Ethereum as its core. "After hundreds of conversations with banks and institutions, one thing is clear: the future of finance will be built on Ethereum," said Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize. "This funding allows us to accelerate the development of institutional-grade infrastructure that rewires Wall Street with Ethereum as its invisible backbone. We're proud to not only be a leading voice for Ethereum on Wall Street, but to also be an engineering powerhouse driving the next wave of institutional blockchain adoption." Ethereum has evolved from a programmer's vision to build the world computer into a global financial infrastructure layer powering hundreds of billions of dollars in activity. It has outpaced rivals by attracting major institutions like JPMorgan, Apollo, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity, BlackRock, and UBS. Today, the Ethereum ecosystem processes 95% of all stablecoin volume ($237.5 billion) and 82% of tokenized real-world assets ($10.5 billion), reinforcing its role as the leading platform for global finance. The Team's Accomplishments Since Etherealize's launch in January 2025, the company has made significant impact across policy, infrastructure, and market engagement, including: Etherealize has built a world-class team of Wall Street veterans such as Jeff Frase (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, co-CEO of Noble Group), McAndrew Rudisill (Tiger, Harbor Island, ETHZilla), Jay Katz (founder of ClearPar and Storm Networks), and top-tier Ethereum and zero-knowledge cryptography engineers all on the charge to merge Wall Street and Ethereum. About Etherealize Etherealize builds Ethereum-based products and infrastructure for Wall Street, delivering compliant, private, and scalable solutions for trading, tokenization, and settlement. Founded in 2025 by Ethereum ecosystem leaders and Wall Street veterans, Etherealize is on a mission to ensure the global financial system is faster, safer, and built for the 21st century.

Posted on 09/03/2025 5:57:02 AM PDT by TigerClaws Four candidates and two reserves from the right-wing AfD political party in Germany have dropped dead within 13 days of each other — just before elections, according to reports. The Alternative for Deutschland candidates were set to appear on ballots in North Rhine-Westphalia on September 14. Officials said no foul play is currently suspected in any of their deaths, the BBC reported. Ralph Lange, 66, Wolfgang Klinger, 71, Stefan Berendes, 59, and Wolfgang Seitz, 59, all kicked the bucket within two weeks of each other, the European Conservative reported. Two reserve candidates also died over the same period. German officials stated that two of the deaths were a result of natural causes, but have not commented on the cause of the others.

Macron and the EUropean Globalists have been killing or trying to assasinate those they don’t like for several years, in addition to massive NGO monies. The US is involved in this at ground level. If the this political party comes to power over the next 8-10 years, Germany will slip from EU membership and rebuild itself; Macron is Mr. Blackrock himself - what we know of them is that they always get what they want. This is a changing of the guard - we can kill the opposition for only so long before their voter base becomes unstable. Germany is in no position to weather internal riots by the German people. 3 posted on 09/03/2025 6:04:55 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws one last thing dont throw them all out of windows mix it up a bit 4 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:40 AM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws Germans doing what Germans do. 5 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:43 AM PDT by brownsfan (It's going to take real, serious, hard times to wake the American public.)

Germany is in no position to weather internal riots by the German people. 3 posted on 09/03/2025 6:04:55 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws one last thing dont throw them all out of windows mix it up a bit 4 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:40 AM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: TigerClaws Germans doing what Germans do. 5 posted on 09/03/2025 6:06:43 AM PDT by brownsfan (It's going to take real, serious, hard times to wake the American public.)

Title: BlackRock calls out state officials for ‘politicization’ of public pensions

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After Republican and Democrat state and local finance officials offered dueling views on fiduciary duty, the asset manager said such “politicization of pension fund management” costs retirees. BlackRock’s letter said “the politicization of pension fund management ultimately costs savers and retirees” and that most of the questions raised in the letters ultimately concern the asset manager’s approach to investment stewardship for its clients. In addition to urging BlackRock and 24 other U.S. financial institutions to stop framing climate change and other “deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks,” the Republican state finance officers sought to have the firms refrain from incorporating net-zero climate commitments, natural capital frameworks or the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive into their investment strategies. Democrat state and local finance officials sent their letter to BlackRock and 17 other firms, looking for the firms to reaffirm their commitment to managing long-term climate change, supply chain and governance-related risks. The officials urged the institutions to expand proxy voting opportunities and develop advanced capital oversight tools. “Fiduciary duty is one of our foundational principles — as an asset manager, we always put our clients and their interests first,” Moffat wrote. “We take this duty seriously and are proud to help 35 million Americans save and invest for retirement, including many who reside in your states.” Moffat said in the response letter that many of the firm’s clients “believe that shareholder participation also encourages a healthier capital market system and serves as a foundational element of America’s strong capital markets.” However, she distinguished the firm from activist investors by noting that BlackRock doesn’t file shareholder proposals or issue board nominations, or “act collectively with other shareholders or organizations” to vote shares or rely on outside proxy advisory firms. “Various federal, state, and local regulators monitor BlackRock’s compliance with standards and commitments that require us to refrain from being an activist shareholder,” BlackRock’s Aug. 27 letter said. “We have always complied with these regulations.” This spring, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission renewed BlackRock’s blanket authorization to acquire up to 20% of voting shares in some public utilities, with FERC finding arguments that the asset manager was an activist investor “unpersuasive.” BlackRock’s letter to the state officials noted that the agency upheld that finding in early August after a request for rehearing from consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen. FERC’s Aug. 6 determination ultimately affirmed its reauthorization of BlackRock’s blanket authorization and separately rejected a joint appeal from a coalition of Republican state attorneys general and conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research as untimely.

Title: BlackRock shares the 3 main things it's learned from a wild first half of 2025 in markets
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-stock-market-trading-lessons-ytd-blackrock-investment-institute-2025-9

With a volatile first half of the year in the books for markets, analysts from the BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) are finally taking some time to breathe and take stock of some lessons learned. The firm cited uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policies as a primary driver of price swings in the first half of the year — but also said the lack of sustained volatility was a surprise in and of itself. In total, the BII team arrived at three main observations from the first eight months of the year, based on how investor behavior has informed moves in the bond market and red-hot AI sector: In the first lesson, BlackRock recalls when the market was able to serve as a guardrail against Trump's most extreme tariff plan. The best example was so-called Liberation Day, when Trump announced a wide range of duties on US trade partners. Stocks plunged and treasury yields spiked. Investors made their displeasure felt, and Trump ultimately walked back some tariffs, or delayed their implementation altogether. "We recognized the global financial order couldn't rewire fast and U.S. stocks have now caught up," the analysts summarized, describing the strategy of betting on these reversals as one of the year's best plays. The BlackRock analysts used the most formidable current mega-force — AI — as their example for lesson number two. Rather than broadly flinging money at AI, investors should be more discerning and realize which areas are still ripe with opportunity, and which are fully priced. Not everything with the word "AI" in its name is going to succeed. BII says the most successful traders will constantly track developments and keep maneuvering over time. From the analysts' perspective, the market is currently in the buildout stage of the AI, the first of three phases that also includes adoption and transformation, both of which will likely take time to develop and may end up changing before they do. "This uncertainty demands adaptability to incoming information," the authors noted, citing the tech stock sell-off sparked by the release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 AI model in January 2025 as an example. While making clear that 2025 has been a complicated year for investing so far, BII's analysts also laid out an inconvenient reality: historically reliable diversifiers like Treasury bonds are no longer as rock-steady as they once were. The analysts argue that the age of long-term US Treasurys offering a spot for resilience during equity market selloffs seems to be over. "Yield movements have broken with pre-pandemic norms as fiscal concerns have mounted, with 30-year U.S. Treasury yields rising as two-year yields fall, reinforcing our preference for shorter-term Treasurys," the report stated. Recommending that investors find new sources of resilience, the analysts highlighted gold's recent surge as a popular diversifier. In addition, they cited bitcoin and private assets as potential means of diversifying portfolios as economic uncertainty persists. Jump to

Title: Thrive Capital’s Philip Clark is promoted to partner

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. What do you want to be when you grow up? It’s a question we all heard as kids, and our answers were frequently telling. A child’s answer— whether firefighter, astronaut, or, in my case, paleontologist—said something about their instincts and their imagined future. Lots of kids dream of space and fire trucks, but Philip Clark had a distinct set of ambitions: he wanted to be a physicist and the CEO of Lockheed Martin. “Oh, I loved the [now-retired Lockheed recon aircraft] SR-71 when I was a kid,” said Clark. “I remember my parents put me in a preschool interview, and I was telling people about the aerodynamics of F-16s. I don’t know how much I really understood at the time, but I was definitely talking about it in building-block interviews with preschool and kindergarten principals. They were like: ‘So, you really want to talk about the air resistance on the angular momentum of this particular wing?’” Today, Clark may not be the CEO of Lockheed Martin (though he’s only 28, so he still has time) but he’s found another route into defense—in 2022, Clark began working on Thrive Capital’s investment in defense tech juggernaut Anduril, last valued this summer at $30.5 billion. Since joining Thrive from 8VC in 2022, Clark has also worked on the firm’s investments in OpenAI, Cursor, Wiz, Nudge, and Physical Intelligence. Now, Clark has been promoted to partner at Thrive, Fortune has exclusively learned. “There aren’t that many companies that end up mattering in world history,” he told Fortune. “I often talk about the alien test: If aliens were to come down to Earth and ask how the world works, what companies would appear in your description of the world?… The test at Thrive, for the companies we invest in, is that we need to believe they will appear on that list.” Thrive, started in 2011 by Joshua Kushner (profiled in Fortune last year), has become known for its big swings—big even among VCs, like doubling down on OpenAI in the largest private tech deal ever. “I often think about the word ‘counterfactual’ when investing,” said Clark. “There are two types of counterfactuals that are really important when I partner with someone. Test A: If this company or idea didn’t exist, would the world look the same or different? And I don’t mean it in a loosey-goosey way. If you walked down the street, would the world look physically different? Or if you go on your computer, does that computer look different? And Test B: Is this person counterfactually impactful? Could I give another really smart person this same idea, and get a similar result on this company? The answer to both these questions is that the idea needs to be counterfactually impactful, and the person needs to be counterfactually important.” Clark’s been at the center of the AI boom—jumping in to help hire at Cursor after Thrive’s investment in 2024 and working on the firm’s OpenAI deal—and he doesn’t think there’s an AI bubble. “People are way too narrow in how they think about what the impact of AI will be on the world,” he said. “There’s a lot about automating knowledge work, but we talk way too little about the fact that this is unlocking fundamentally new ways of manipulating atoms in the physical world… You can actually build fast, manufacturable, easily configurable, highly-customized, valuable hardware and physical world solutions to lots of problems.” That said, there is, of course, nuance. “Things can be simultaneously true,” said Clark. “Lots of less strong businesses can be funded as the most important companies in the world are created. I don’t think we’re in a dotcom era bubble right now, but it was true even then that the most important companies of the Internet were created—Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. That was true even as you had Pets.com and Webvan. Our job is to make sure you partner with Amazon, and as long as you do that early—’97, ‘99, 2001—that’s going to be an important and wild journey.” AI update… Anthropic announced yesterday it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation, with investors including Iconiq, Fidelity, and Lightspeed. Elsewhere, OpenAI announced plans to acquire Statsig for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal. In May, we had the exclusive on Statsig’s last funding round, which was conducted at the same valuation it was acquired for.

Title: Seán Moran: After nearly a century, has the time come for a GAA President of Ireland?

The involvement of such a high-profile Gaelic games personality as Jim Gavin in the race for the Áras underlines how infrequently the GAA has been a significant factor in the careers of past presidents. Gavin’s life as a public servant in both the armed forces and aviation sector has been combined with civic involvement. Between chairing Dublin’s North East Inner City programme implementation board and the Citizen’s Assembly on a directly elected mayor for the city, he has decent credentials for a run at elected office. How he fares in the bear pit of securing the Fianna Fáil nomination is one thing, and if successful, the circumstances of having his life forensically scrutinised will be another matter. But he has clearly prepared for this and will have detailed plans to take it on one step farther. At Oireachtas and government level, there has never been any shortage of GAA-gene pool politicians, especially in Fianna Fáil. Current Taoiseach Micheál Martin is a committed Nemo Rangers supporter. His predecessor Brian Cowen played football for Offaly. The exemplar of the connection is Jack Lynch, winner of six successive All-Ireland medals and a lifelong supporter of Gaelic games. Given the strength of that connection, the broader question of why the GAA has been so sparsely represented in the Phoenix Park comes into focus in the week of Éamon De Valera’s 50th anniversary. His assertion that hurling and rugby were the games most suited to the Irish temperament is well known and this newspaper had a role in Dev’s most famous, or notorious, statement about Gaelic games, made just two years before he became president. Speaking at the southern branch of the Blackrock Past Pupils’ Union annual dinner, held at Shannon Airport in April 1957, he regretted that hurling was no longer played in the school. There was also a lament that he had felt unable to attend a rugby match since 1913 because he didn’t “want it raised as a political matter and having rows kicked up about it but I will not deny that I am a keen listener to rugby commentaries”. An Irish Times reporter was on hand to detail the following controversial statement. “For Irishmen there is no football game that could equal rugby and if all our young men played rugby,” he said, “we would not only beat England and Wales, but France and the whole lot of them together.” It was hardly surprising that in the one county guaranteed to have a view on what football game was paramount, the then-taoiseach’s views came under scrutiny. At a meeting in Tralee on May 11th, Kerry county board squabbled over whether De Valera’s comments were or were not “worthy of discussion”. County chair FJ Sheehy said that he was afraid that “the taoiseach was letting too many statements go by the board”. James Barrett, of the well-known Tralee family, said that the taoiseach was being taken out of context and had issued a denial and clarified his original statement to the effect that “Irishmen in international rugby would have made a name for themselves but that hurling was their game”. The chair wasn’t convinced, saying that if the original report had been correct, it was “an outlandish statement”. JJ Sheehy, the 1920s All-Ireland winner and well-known republican, was reported as saying that it was “not the games they were comparing but the things for which they stood. The GAA fighting for the freedom of the country, the language, the games and everything distinctive of Irish nationalism”. In the end, the board decided against issuing a statement by 13 votes to eight. In a postscript, the editor of The Irish Times said the paper was satisfied that their reporter’s version of the original speech was correct. De Valera was still a fixture at All-Ireland finals during his presidency. He was never a member of the GAA, though. This was significant during the association’s most notorious interaction with the presidency during the very first term of office of Douglas Hyde. In November 1938, Hyde together with taoiseach De Valera, attended an Ireland-Poland soccer match at Dalymount Park. The president was also patron of the GAA and his presence at the international was a breach of the then operative ban on foreign games. The GAA could do nothing about De Valera’s attendance, as he wasn’t a member but Hyde was removed as patron of the association. [ Jim Gavin profile: Is the former Dublin GAA manager a good fit for president?Opens in new window ] It is ironic that the most successful of the movements for cultural independence that took root at the end of the 19th century, was the sporting one – the GAA – but despite its local community base, it has had limited success in providing candidates for the presidency. Perhaps the underlying exclusiveness of the association for many years – it’s little more than 50 years since the ban was abolished and even less time since the prohibitions on British security force membership and the use of GAA grounds by other sports, followed it – impacted at a broader level. It is true that a recent president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin, former Antrim player and Sigerson Cup winner with Queen’s, are very much from that background and the former president is currently grappling with the knotty challenge of integrating the women’s and men’s Gaelic games associations. But McAleese’s background was as a lawyer with political connections to Fianna Fáil when initially elected in 1997. Given that a successful presidential term can make it harder to get out of the Áras than into it, whoever wins in October might well be in office until 2039, taking it beyond the centenary of the presidency, which was originally devised in the 1937 Constitution. Has the time come for a successful candidate whose primary profile arises from Gaelic games? sean.moran@irishtimes.com Get an in-depth look at the weekend's action and the best analysis of upcoming fixtures in our weekly newsletter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘The judge told me I would die in prison’ – Irishman to share his story of being held hostage in Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block’

Bernard Phelan, in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom from Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block,’ where he was held for over 200 days. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. An innocent Irishman held hostage in ‘Satan’s Block’ in Iran for over 200 days, told an RTÉ documentary a judge informed him: “You will die in prison.” The harrowing jail term saw former tourism worker Bernard Phelan, aged in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom. Mr Phelan went from working in tourism IT and co-owning a well known LGBTQ+ bar in Paris - to being imprisoned, wrongly accused of providing information to an enemy country. You Will Die In Prison, An Irishman’s Hostage story, airs tonight at 10.35pm on RTÉ One and unearths the mental and physical toll one innocent man withstood and his survival against the might of the Iranian regime. Born in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, Mr Phelan grew up in Blackrock, South Co Dublin. He was living in Paris, before being taken hostage in Mashhad, Iran in October 2022. “I was taken to an interrogation centre in a car, blindfolded and handcuffed and that's when the nightmare really started,” Mr Phelan told the RTÉ documentary. “As I left the room, the judge said to me, through his translation: ‘You will die in prison.’ That was a big shock.” After visiting the country as a tourist, Mr Phelan struck up a business relationship with a company offering adventure tours. And in September 2022, he visited Iran to meet the business owners. However, the dual Irish-French national was, he admits, in the “wrong place at the wrong time.” The country had just witnessed a watershed moment, an uprising for women’s rights, after the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. The young woman was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with Iranian Government protocol. She died in police custody, sparking huge protests, the likes never witnessed in Iran. As he visited the exterior of the holy Imam Reza Mosque in Mashhad, where his business partner was taking photographs, Mr Phelan was arrested and taken to an interrogation centre. He was blindfolded and handcuffed and “that’s when the nightmare really started,” he said. Mr Phelan was kept in chains and named Number 67 in Arabic. When his number was called, he had no idea if he was to be given bread or have his throat slit. He described being moved to Mashhad Prison, meant to hold 1,500 prisoners, but where he believed there may be as many as 20,000. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 3rd 2025 A judge warned him he may die in the jail. But determined to secure his freedom, Mr Phelan launched a campaign from his prison cell. His father Vincent Phelan hand delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy in Dublin calling for his release. Mr Phelan befriended a political prisoner, Taj Muhammed Khormali, eventually executed on April 8, 2025. “Sometimes you heard them crying,” Mr Phelan said, of the prisoners condemned to death. “You don’t know when you’re going to die, it could be tomorrow morning or two years time,” he said. “I imagined my health would give up,” he said. “I wasn't in good health, I had high blood pressure, HIV… I take medication to avoid stroke. I take tablets for depression. My mental state was very fragile. I really had very black thoughts." He told the documentary he went on hunger strike but was forced to relent when his father begged him to stop. "Please don't do this to me, I want to see you alive,” his father wrote. “If my dad died while I was in prison, I’d have gone back on hunger strike,” Mr Phelan, who still suffers from PTSD, said. The tide only began to turn when President Michael D Higgins wrote twice to his father, promising he would do all he could to assist. The family then pressured the Irish Government via the media on its plans to open an Irish embassy in Tehran. This led to Irish-French negotiations with Iran, with Mr Phelan’s release being the linchpin to future embassy plans. “If I’d had my visa and my Irish passport, I’d not have been arrested,” Mr Phelan believes. He was finally released in May 2023 and flown back in a medical bed to Paris. His husband, Roland Bonello and family, greeted him at the airport. In October, 2024, Vincent Phelan finally got to meet President Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, with his son. But just one week later the 98-year-old passed away. “My dad was so proud he got to see Michael D. The next day he had an accident and passed away a week later, shortly before his 99th birthday,” he said. “But he got to see the president and got letters from the president. He had a good life, an unusual end of life because of me. It was a full life.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Holds Back on XRP as ETF Rumors Heat Up for Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink

Time Published: 2025-09-03T02:00:30Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has opted not to file for a U.S. spot XRP ETF in 2025 despite the SEC reclassifying XRP as a digital commodity and settling its lawsuit with Ripple. The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

The index tracks the seven largest US technology companies, Coinbase's own stock, and BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase will launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure, according to a Sept. 2 announcement. The product will debut on Sept. 22, arriving less than two months after Coinbase began offering CFTC-regulated perpetuals to US customers in July. The hybrid index tracks 10 equally weighted components: the seven largest US technology companies, known as the “Magnificent Seven,” Coinbase’s own stock, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Each component represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weightings. The Magnificent Seven stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. The cryptocurrency exposure is provided through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), offering indirect access to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. Coinbase positions the product as addressing investor demand for dual exposure to traditional financial instruments and digital assets. The company stated that no US-listed derivative previously offered access to both equities and cryptocurrencies within a futures product. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via The monthly cash-settled contracts represent $1 multiplied by the index value. At an example index price of $3,000, each contract would carry a notional value of $3,000. MarketVector serves as the official index provider for calculation and maintenance. The launch builds on Coinbase’s derivatives expansion following its July introduction of CFTC-regulated perpetual contracts for US customers. Those products offer up to 10x leverage with 0.02% fees on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coinbase frames the equity index futures as marking “the next evolution of our product suite” and paving the way for multi-asset derivatives that broaden access and efficiency for investors. The company promises to expand availability to retail users in the coming months after the initial launch through partner platforms.

Alphabet shares popped 6% in extended trading. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice, including selling off its Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads. “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,” the decision states. “Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The Problem Is Solved by Art, Not Science

Time Published: 2025-09-02T20:00:00Z

Editor Solutions Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey A. Tucker So much of what is considered science today is really just art. It’s a subjective interpretation of the meaning of data. Data does not speak for itself. It does not tell you cause and effect. It provides no predictive map for the future. It’s often incorrect or merely a proximate rendering of the full reality. Even the best and most experienced experts and invested stakeholders cannot overcome this problem. The implications of this insight are vast. Let’s start with an easy example. Did you see Gladiator II? It had many of the same actors as the first movie that swept the awards and captivated audiences worldwide. It had bloody fight scenes. It had great music. It had creepy relationships, wicked power plays, feats of derring-do, displays of all kinds of cruelty and heroics, plus CGI of a recreated Roman Colosseum, this time with the floor flooded with water for a sea battle. And yet the movie left audiences with not much. The experience was overall evaporative and the message elusive. The magic was missing. That special story arc of drama that swept us up in the first was strangely absent. At some point halfway through – and speaking as someone who loved the first – it struck me that I could walk away and not really care how it ended. This often happens with sequels. It’s not just because the directors and producers see an easy buck by roping in audiences to throw down for tickets, hoping to relive the experience of the first. Sequels are often a pale copy of the first because the producers, scriptwriters, and directors are themselves not entirely sure why the first one was great. The movie makers can workshop this all day and for weeks. They can gather focus groups. They can talk to experts. They can pay the actors the big bucks. Everyone will have a theory, and they can try to recreate and reboot the thing as best they can. But at some point, no matter how hard they try and with many millions on the line, they leave the magical creative world of art and enter into the mundane task of recreation. With all their efforts, the drama is drained away. No one knows for sure when or how that happens. This example comes to mind in the midst of the continued meltdown over the logo change at Cracker Barrel. It seems obvious in retrospect that eliminating Uncle Herschel (a real person who was the uncle of the founder) and the barrel was a bad idea. It comes at a time of rising nostalgia and deep public suspicion of major corporations and their perceived attack on basic values. Maybe it is not entirely clear why this one logo change would have ignited populist fury in normal times but when you consider the loss of trust in everything, this struck people as deeply offensive. We learn from deeper reports on the decision that it was not arbitrary. The new CEO Julie Felss Masino, hired in 2023, was tasked with bringing back customers and the stock price after it was slammed during Covid lockdowns. That’s a huge challenge for anyone, especially given the roaring inflation that followed the money printing of the period. Julie reached into her communications undergraduate degree and her Master’s of Business Administration and found a possible answer. The goal is to attract a younger generation. She had heard from her social set many times that the union of the word “cracker” with a white guy in overalls has racist overtones. Maybe it refers to cracking the whip. Maybe it is a signal that only whites are allowed. Maybe the overalls suggest it is only for farmers or aging nostalgists. In any case, it seemed obvious to her that an update was in order. Further, the executive team brought in focus groups. They did customer surveys. They assembled all the empirical evidence they could find. In the end, they discerned that they would win more with a change than they would lose from those who would miss the old sign. This intuition was further backed by a plan for interior changes. Down with all the bric-a-brac on the walls and up with a cleaner look of an Apple store. After all, this is where interior design seems to be headed. Shouldn’t Cracker Barrel keep up? And yet, once the announcement was made, the customers and the public were invited to respond. What they saw was one of the few franchises with symbolism that drew on cultural memory and its replacement by the soulless, barren, and deracinated symbolism that has defined so much of what everyone hates about public life today. It suggested that yet another huge corporation was trampling on history, tradition, and meaning. Consumers these days are interested in testing their power in ways akin to voters. They will buy or decline to buy as a way of rewarding or punishing companies that make decisions that affect the aesthetics of public life. We’ve seen this with Jaguar, Bud Light, Target, and many other companies that have run afoul of the emerging public mood that trends toward a kind of restoration. To reward or decline to do so is the very essence of the capitalist experience. It is a manner of taking back power for the people. Companies make mistakes all the time. That’s because marketing is not science. It is art, an extension of human judgment, just like making movies or writing songs. We can flatter ourselves that the answer is always in the data. They can do surveys and focus groups. But often all those techniques can lead managers astray to the point that they land far afield of what could be called common sense. If anyone from Cracker Barrel’s management had entered a restaurant and shown the two images side by side to an average customer, they could have anticipated the uproar. The problem is that ideology is blinding toward reality that any average person can see. The same is true of high-end credentials and impressive resumes. They confer not wisdom but exaggerated confidence in subjective judgment. The career of the new CEO took her from Sprinkles Cupcake to Starbucks to Taco Bell. Surely she has the requisite experience. But what if that experience consisted of working within a tight bubble of influence of people from her social and professional class? After all, she kept trading up in her career and now pulls in $6.8 million a year – not exactly in keeping with the medium family income of the typical customer of Cracker Barrel. The point is that her class and social bubble affected her judgment, as well as those around her. All the data, surveys, and focus groups did not dislodge her prevailing theory that modernization was the key to return to profitability. The test happened in real life: the decision was a calamity. Maybe it pleased BlackRock, which is the largest single stockholder. Maybe it pleased her social set. She was certainly pleased with the decision. But the general public flew into fury. Management and marketing in graduate school is often rendered as empirical sciences. That’s ridiculous but such is the bias of our age. Everyone thinks there is some system, some mechanism, some machine, some data set, that will point the right way. This applies in every area, including infectious disease, pharmacology, government, and thousands of other fields. The belief that the data speaks for itself is the religion of our time. The trouble is that it does not. We are just as controlled by value systems and subjective judgment as were men in the ancient world. All our techniques have changed nothing about this. This week, for example, Brownstone Institute found itself embroiled in a highly technical argument over the RSV shot for babies. An outside committee of the CDC approved it with only two no votes, one member of whom reported real doubts about the data. Sure enough, Brownstone reported the problems, which are highly technical. Then it got worse as more data scientists weighed in. Now there is a genuine question about whether the committee was presented with truthful data. The larger issue is that the manufacturer wanted the shot approved and so did the CDC. The study and data and appearance of science was secondary, a mere veneer to a larger agenda that was driven by a value proposition. They wanted the shot out there. The science was just the excuse. But then it fell apart or, at least, did not hold up to the promise. Now we find ourselves again in the awkward position of having trusted the experts and discovering that this was not a good idea. One of the great books of our age is Tom Harrington’s The Treason of the Experts. He writes from the point of view of the humanities, explaining many of the above points. He explains that everyone is working hard to find the science of what is really an art. This point applies to the healing arts as well. Why did anyone think that locking down society would be good for health? It’s nuts and anyone could have known that, unless the person had a head full of models and maths. The fake science literally blinded the entire world. What’s happened to many brands and to many countries traces to the adoption of a superstition with a scientific veneer. Fortunately, the people have some limited means of making a correction, smacking the fake experts around a bit, and resetting the world to operate in a way that is more humane and intuitively truthful. This could be the next stage of history. With the experts and the science having led us to a place of disaster, the principles, arts, and ethics of old can lead us back to a better place.

Title: AI chatbots for doctors are hot. But there’s plenty of value ‘down the stack’ too, argues Corti CEO

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Among the most interesting AI stories this week was an item about a Boston-area startup called OpenEvidence that uses generativeAI to provide answers to clinical questions based data from leading medical journals. The free-to-use app has proved enormously popular among doctors, with some surveys suggesting at least 40% of all U.S. physicians are using OpenEvidence to stay on top of the latest medical research and to ensure they are offering the most up-to-date treatments to patients. On the back of that kind of viral growth, OpenEvidence was able to raise $210 million in a venture capital deal in July that valued the company at $3.5 billion. OpenEvidence is also the same company that a few weeks back said that its AI system was able to score 100% on the U.S. medical licensing exam. (See the “Eye on AI Numbers” section of the August 21st edition of this newsletter.) All of which may explain why, just a month later, the company is reportedly in talks for another venture deal that would almost double that valuation to $6 billion. (That’s according to a story in tech publication The Information which cited three unnamed people it said had knowledge of the discussions.)A lot of the use of OpenEvidence today would qualify as “shadow AI”—doctors are using it and finding value, but they aren’t necessarily admitting to their patients or employers that they are using it. They are also often using it outside enterprise-grade systems that are designed to provide higher-levels of security, data privacy, and compliance, and to integrate seamlessly with other business systems.Ultimately, that could be a problem, according to Andreas Cleve, the cofounder and CEO of Corti, a Danish medical AI company that is increasingly finding traction by offering healthcare institutions “AI infrastructure” designed specifically for medical use cases. (Full disclosure: Corti’s partners include Wolters Kluwer, a huge software company that markets a clinical evidence engine called UpToDate that competes with OpenEvidence.) AI infrastructure is a pivot for Corti, which was founded way back in 2016 and spent the first decade of its existence building its own speech recognition and language understanding systems for emergency services and hospitals. The company still markets its “Corti assistant” as a solution for healthcare systems that want an AI-power clinical scribe that can operate well in noisy hospital environments and integrate with electronic health records. But Cleve told me in a recent conversation that the company doesn’t see its future in selling a front-end solution to doctors, but instead selling key components in “the AI stack” to the companies that are offering front-end tools. “We tried to be both a product vendor for healthcare and an infrastructure vendor, and that meant competing with all the other apps in healthcare, and it was like, terrible,” he says. Instead, Corti has decided its real value lies in providing the “healthcare grade” backend on which AI applications, many of them produced by third parties, run. The backend Corti provides includes medical AI models—which others can wrap user-facing products around—as well as the platform on which AI agents for healthcare use cases can run. For instance, it has built an API called FactsR, which is an AI reasoning model that is designed to check the facts that medical notetaking scribes or clinical AI systems produce. It uses a lot of tokens, Cleve says, which would make it too expensive for general purpose voice transcription. But because of how much is riding on clinical notes being accurate, it can be worth it to a vendor to pay for FactsR, Cleve says.Another example: earlier this summer Corti announced a partnership with Voicepoint, a speech recognition and digital transcription service that is used by doctors across Switzerland. Voicepoint will use Corti’s AI models to help with tasks such as summarization of conversations into medical notes and possibly, in the future, with diagnostic support. To do this though, Corti had to set up dedicated AI infrastructure, including data centers located in Switzerland, to comply with strict Swiss data residency rules. Now, Corti is able to offer this same backbone infrastructure to other healthcare companies that want to deploy AI solutions in Switzerland. And Corti has similar AI infrastructure in place in countries like Germany that also have strict data residency and data privacy rules.Cleve tells me that healthcare is increasingly part of the discussions around “sovereign AI.” This is particularly true in Europe, where many governments are worried about having their citizens’ medical information stored on the servers of U.S. companies, which might be subject to U.S. government pressure, legal or otherwise, to provide data access. “None of these things are doable today, because the majority of all the AI apps are running on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, and they are all American companies over which America asserts jurisdiction,” Cleve says.But even within the U.S., strict cybersecurity and patient privacy requirements often mean that using an off-the-shelf, general-purpose AI system won’t cut it. “A lot of customers have requirements like, ‘Hey, we will never want to have data leave premises, or we will never share a tenant, or we will never co-encrypt with our consumer customer on the GPU rack, because we want to know where our data is because we have to prove that to legislators,’” he says. Cleve also tells me that he thinks the giant, general purpose AI builders—the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—are unlikely to conquer healthcare, despite the fact that they have been making moves to build models either fine-tuned or specifically-trained to answer clinical questions. He says this is because healthcare isn’t a single vertical, but rather a collection of highly-specialized niches, most of which are too narrow to be interesting to these tech behemoths. The note-taking needs of a GP in a relatively quiet office who needs to summarize a 10-minute consultation are quite different from a doctor working in the chaos and noise of a busy city ER, which are different again from a psychiatrist who needs to summarize not just a 10-minute consultation, but maybe an hour-long therapy session. As an example, Cleve says another Corti customer is a company in Germany that makes software just to help dentists automate billing based on audio transcripts of their sessions with patients. “They’re a vertical within a vertical,” he says. “But they are growing like 100% a year and have done so for several years. But they are super niche.” It will be interesting to watch Corti going forward. Perhaps Cleve is correct that the AI stack is wide enough, deep enough and varied enough to create opportunities for lots of different vertical and regional players. Or, it could be that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google devour everyone else. Time will tell. With that, here’s more AI news. Jeremy Kahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.com@jeremyakahn Correction, Sept. 3: A previous version of this story misreported the year Corti was founded. It also mischaracterized the relationship between Corti and Wolters Kluwer.

The company said it has begun publicly testing MAI-1-preview, its first large foundation AI model built fully in-house, as well as MAI-Voice, a fast voice generation model that is small enough to run on a single GPU. The new models mark a significant step by Microsoft to reduce its reliance on OpenAI, despite remaining a major investor in the AI company. MAI-1-preview was trained with 15,000 Nvidia H100 chips, according to Microsoft, and will be rolled out for some Microsoft Copilot text tasks in the coming weeks. In the LMArena, a public benchmark for LLMs, the model currently ranks below rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others. You can read more from CNBC here. OpenAI says it will add parental controls and additional safeguards to ChatGPT. The company said it would, within the next month, allow parents to link their accounts to those of their teenage children, giving them more control over the kids' interaction with ChatGPT. It also said that it would soon institute better safeguards in general, actively screening interactions for signs of emotional distress on the part of users and routing these conversations to its GPT-5 Thinking model, which the company says does a better job of adhering to guardrails meant to prevent the model from encouraging self-harm or delusional behavior. The moves come after a high-profile lawsuit accused the company's ChatGPT model of encouraging the suicide of a 16-year old teen and several other cases in which people allege ChatGPT encouraged suicide, self-harm, or violence. You can read more here from Axios. Anthropic valued at $183 billion after $13 billion venture capital round. The AI company announced that it had raised $13 billion Series F funding round led by the venture capital firm Iconiq, and "co-led" by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners. A long list of other investors—including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, Jane Street, and T. Rowe Price, among others—also participated. The company, which was previously valued at $61.5 billion in a March funding round, said it now served more than 300,000 business customers and that its Claude Code coding model was currently generating at least $42 million in revenue each month. Anthropic's blog post announcing the funding round is here. X.ai enters the battle for coders with new AI “agentic coding” model. The company debuted its first AI coding model, called grok-code-fast-1, which is supposed to be both “speedy and economical,” according to the company. It is being made available for free for a limited time and is both available on GitHub and through coding “wrappers” such as Cursor and Windsurf. The model is an indication that X.ai founder Elon Musk is serious about taking on OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind across the entire range of AI applications, not just in the consumer chatbot space. It also shows just how intense the competition to capture marketshare among software developers is becoming. You can read more from Reuters here.X.ai sues former engineer for allegedly taking trade secrets to OpenAI. Elon Musk’s AI startup x.AI has filed suit against former engineer Xuechen Li, alleging he stole trade secrets about its Grok chatbot and took them to his new job at OpenAI, Reuters reported. Li was not immediately available to respond to the allegations. The lawsuit follows other legal battles Musk has launched against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of monopolistic practices and straying from OpenAI’s original mission.Anthropic says it will begin training AI models on user chats unless they opt out. The move is a major shift in data privacy policies for the AI model maker, which also said it was extending the length of time it retained user data to five years. Users can opt out by September 28. Some users and data privacy experts criticized the decision, noting that the design of Anthropic’s “Accept” button could cause many to agree without noticing the toggle that controls data sharing. Others speculated that Anthropic was making the move because it is running out of other ways to obtain enough data to train models that will compete with OpenAI and Google. Enterprise users of Anthropic’s Claude model, as well as government, education, or API users, are not affected. Anthropic says it filters sensitive information and does not sell user data to third parties. You can read more from The Verge here. More evidence emerges that AI may be leading to job losses. Last week in Eye on AI, I covered research from economists at Stanford University whose research indicated that AI was leading to job losses, particularly among entry level employees, in professions that were highly-exposed to AI. This week, more evidence emerges from another well-designed study, this one carried out by the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Although this study did not look at whether younger and older workers were affected differently, it did examine the link between occupations that had adopted AI most intensively and job losses and found a distinct correlation. The impacts were greatest in occupations that used mathematics and computing intensively, such as software development, and much less in blue collar work and fields such as healthcare that were less prone to being automated with AI. You can read the St. Louis Fed study here. Both the Stanford and St. Louis Fed research suggest that job losses from the implementation of AI are likely to be concentrated in some sectors, and not economy-wide. That said, as good as these studies are, I still think both fail to disentangle the effects of AI from the possible effects of the unwinding of the tech hiring boom that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, many large companies bulked up their software development and IT departments. Major tech firms such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft hired tens of thousands of new employees, sometimes hiring people before there was even any work for them to do just in order to prevent rivals from snapping up the same coders. Then, when the pandemic ended and it was clear that some ideas, such as Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, were not going to pan out, these same companies laid off tens of thousands of workers. I don’t think I’ve seen research yet that can separate the technology sector’s shedding of jobs created during the pandemic from the impact of AI. But I am sure someone is working on it and when they crack that nut, we’ll definitely report it here. Sept. 8-10: Fortune Brainstorm Tech, Park City, Utah. Apply to attend here.

Preventing 'parasocial' chatbots.’ It’s increasingly clear that chatbots can encourage ‘parasocial’ relationships, where a user develops a harmful emotional attachment to the chatbot or the chatbot encourages the user to engage in self-harm of some kind. The parents of several teenagers who took their own lives after conversations with chatbots are now suing AI companies, saying they did not do enough to prevent chatbots from encouraging self-harm. And, short of suicides, there is other mounting evidence of people developing harmful chatbot dependencies.Well, a new benchmark from researchers at Hugging Face, called INTIMA (Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark), aims to evaluate LLMs on their “companionship-seeking” behavior. The benchmark looks at 31 distinct behaviors across four different categories of interaction and 368 prompts. Testing Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4, researchers found that models more often reinforced companionship than maintained boundaries, though they varied: for instance, Claude was more likely to resist personification, while Gemma reinforced intimacy. You can read the Hugging Face paper here.At the same time, researchers from Aligned AI, an Oxford startup I’ve covered before, published research showing that one LLM can be used to successfully screen the outputs of another LLM for parasocial behavior and then prompt that chatbot to steer the conversation in a less harmful direction.

A man in his 40s has been arrested after cocaine with an estimated value of €140,000 was seized in Dublin. Around two kilograms of the drug was seized in Blackrock by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, DMR East Divisional Drug Unit and Revenue officers. The man is currently detained at a garda station in Dublin under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996. The drugs have been sent for analysis and investigations are ongoing. Revenue said in a statement that the seizure is part of its "ongoing work targeting smuggling and shadow economy activity". "If businesses, or members of the public have any information, they can contact Revenue in confidence on Confidential Phone Number 1800 295 295," it added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former scout leader died by suicide day before trial on sex abuse charges, coroner finds

A verdict of suicide has been recorded at an inquest following the death of a former scout leader who had been accused of the historical sexual abuse of boys in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s. Neville Kearns (69) died in a single-vehicle collision in Churchtown, south Dublin, shortly after 6am on April 7th last year. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He had been due to stand trial the following day on 113 counts including charges of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape and attempted rape. These related to allegations, made by five complainants, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. Dublin coroner Dr Clare Keane recorded the verdict on Tuesday, noting the cause of death was thoracic and musculoskeletal injuries consistent with a collision. The inquest heard that when emergency services arrived at the scene they found a red 2002 Toyota Hiace van had crashed into a tree on the wrong side of Churchtown Road Upper. Garda John Culleton said the weather was dry on the morning in question and there was no evidence “whatsoever” of braking on the road. Damage to the vehicle was “concentrated” on the driver’s side, he said. The inquest heard how Kearns was not wearing a seat belt. Emergency services had to remove the door to get Kearns from the vehicle. Paramedics performed CPR, but Kearns was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.34am, the inquest heard. [ The Dublin scout leader who died a day before his trial and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Gda David O’Brien inspected the van after the crash. He said, despite how old the vehicle was, it was “serviceable” and the tyres and brakes were in “good condition”. Gda Culleton said the evidence indicated Kearns most likely turned the van “towards the tree” and the damage caused to the tree indicated the vehicle was “travelling well above the speed limit”. At the time of his death, Kearns was a caretaker at Edenvale Apartments, a gated apartment complex on Grange Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin. He lived in a campervan on the grounds, the inquest heard. The van involved in the collision was a different vehicle to the campervan in which he lived. Biba van Belle, Kearns’s niece, told the inquest she removed his personal belongings from the campervan and a storage facility at Edenvale Apartments following his death. Among the belongings were documents which were later handed over to gardaí. Ms van Belle last spoke to her uncle more than 20 years before his death, the inquest heard. Sergeant Robert Scott from Blackrock Garda station said he spoke to a number of people who had contact with Kearns prior to his death and it appeared Kearns was “trying to get affairs in order”. Sgt Scott told the inquest the documents found in the campervan and shed included a note in which Kearns said he was “tired of it all” and “must bring closure to it all”. A will was found on a table in the campervan, Sgt Scott said, as well as documents showing Kearns’s funeral had already been paid for. These receipts dated from 2020 when gardaí first contacted Kearns about the abuse allegations, the inquest heard. Sgt Scott said gardaí believed the location of the crash was significant as it was close to where Kearns held unofficial scout meetings decades earlier. He said there was “no third-party involvement or anything of a suspicious nature” related to Kearns’s death. He said he believed Kearns had taken his own life. Detective Sergeant Barry O’Connor identified Kearns’s body the following day at the mortuary at St Columcille’s Hospital in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin. Det Sgt O’Connor told the inquest he had met Kearns several times before the man’s death. [ PODCAST: Now he can be named - the Dublin scout leader and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Kearns was a member of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the 1970s prior to setting up his own unofficial scouting group. One alleged victim told The Irish Times in June how Kearns’s death was “his final act of cowardice”. Imagining what he would have said to Kearns in court, he stated: “You had the opportunity to face up to what you had done, but you chose not to and so you have left a despicable legacy of abuse over decades.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Anthropic Hits $183 Billion Valuation After Series F Funding

AI research company Anthropic has secured $13 billion in Series F funding to reach a $183 billion valuation, highlighting investor confidence in its accelerating growth and product strength. The funding round is led by ICONIQ alongside key contributions from Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, and makes Anthropic one of the most valuable startups in the world. Among the backers are Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, and Insight Partners, among others. The company’s financial performance has surged in recent months. At the beginning of the year, Anthropic reported an annual run-rate revenue of around one billion dollars. By August, that figure had soared to more than 5 billion dollars, a 5x increase in less than 9 months. Anthropic also revealed that it now serves more than 300,000 business customers. The number of large enterprise clients generating over $100,000 in run-rate revenue has grown nearly 7 times in the past year alone. Claude Code, a tool aimed at developers, has emerged as one of its most successful products, generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue. The Series F raise follows a Series E round earlier this year, when Anthropic collected $3.5 billion at a valuation of $61.5 billion. The leap to a $183 billion valuation in just a few months underscores how quickly confidence in the company has grown. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, the company has consistently emphasized building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values. With the new capital, Anthropic plans to expand its enterprise footprint, accelerate research into AI safety, and extend its international reach.

Iconiq co-led the round with Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to the company’s blog post. Other backers include a string of institutional investors, VCs, sovereign wealth funds, private equity, and asset managers, such as Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, Insight Partners, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, and more. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,” Anthropic CFO Krishna Rao said in the post. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.” Anthropic last raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation in March 2025. This latest fundraise comes after reports that Anthropic was nearing a deal to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in funding at a $170 billion valuation. It also follows impressive growth from the AI startup, which reported a jump in annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion over the course of 2025 amid accelerated API usage and enterprise adoption. “Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year,” the company said in the company blog post. Claude Code is also a developer favorite and one of the main impetuses for Anthropic’s growth. The company said its vibe-coding product already generates more than $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in the last three months. But maintaining that growth and competing with rivals like OpenAI, Cursor, and others requires more money, as its CEO Dario Amodei recently confessed in a memo, reported by Wired. He said he wasn’t “thrilled” about taking money from sovereign wealth funds of dictatorial governments, but that it’s difficult to run a business by excluding “bad people” from investing.

Title: 4 ways to play the market as stocks enter their worst stretch of the year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-tips-recommendations-outlook-sp500-equity-playbook-september-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-02T16:09:51Z
Full Content:
It hasn't been an amazing start to the month for stocks. The market is kicking off September in the red, with the Dow dropping more than 500 points on Monday as investors cashed in some of their recent gains and fretted over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But that would be considered par for the course for the stock market, which has historically struggled during the month of September — commonly referred to as the market's weakest month of the year. Historically, the S&P 500 has shed an average 0.7% over the month of September for the last 75 years. In months when the benchmark index lost, the average drawdown for the month was 3.8%, according to an analysis from LPL Financial. But that isn't to say there isn't room for investors to get into or stay in the market, so long as they're willing to stomach some volatility. "Seasonal data represents the typical climate for stocks but not the weather," Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL financial, wrote in a recent client note. "And currently, the weather for the S&P 500 is filled with blue skies and record highs. When accounting for momentum and trend, which we believe is much-needed context, September doesn't look so bad." Here are four ways traders should be looking at the month ahead, according to the combined recommendations from seven investing pros: A stock sell-off this month could be your friend, if you're willing to look at the decline as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Morgan Stanley said they remained "buyers of dips should they come" in the coming months, despite weak seasonal trends for stocks. That's partly because the bank doubts the market has fully priced in the bullish impact of the Fed's expected rate cuts, with central bankers most likely teeing up a 25-basis-point cut at the end of the month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "We push back on the idea that rate cuts are already priced as equity returns tend to be strong during rate cutting cycles, and rate-sensitive areas like small caps are barely off the relative lows," a team led by Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote. Other forecasters on Wall Street have also expressed faith in the market's long-running upward trend. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel said he believed the bull market still had further to go, pointing to incoming Fed rate cuts, strong corporate earnings, and historically normal valuations in the S&P 500 when excluding the Magnificent Seven companies. "September being historically really the worst month of the year. Listen, you know, certainly we could have a pullback," he said. "I still think the bull trends are intact." Now could also be a good time for investors to diversify their portfolio in the bond market, strategists at Société Générale wrote in a note last week. The European bank pointed to a thinning gap between the performance of equities and bonds in recent months. A separate analysis from Apollo Global Management found that investment grade corporate bonds and short-term US Treasurys had been outperforming expected returns in the S&P 500 in recent years, based on the index's forward earnings. "Diversification into bonds is becoming beneficial again, especially in the US," SocGen wrote. In its latest weekly commentary, BlackRock also said it had a strategic, five-year call on bonds. "We are overweight short-term inflation-linked bonds as US tariffs could push up inflation," strategists wrote in a note last month. "The bottom line is that fixed income remains more attractive than the implied yield levels in public equity markets at the moment," Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist, wrote last week. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, said she liked areas of the market that were considered to be less expensive compared to the broader S&P 500 index. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, she highlighted housing in particular, given that activity in the sector is showing some signs of ramping up. Existing home sales in the US crept up 2% on a seasonally adjusted year-over-year basis in July, thanks partly to the small improvement in housing affordability, the National Association of Realtors said. Housing stocks have also tended to do well at a time when earnings across the broader market have struggled, Link noted. "I am a big housing bull. I think that we're just starting to see a recovery in housing," she said. "We have maybe a rocky six weeks. So I think you take advantage of that," she added of the broader seasonal weakness in markets. "I think the fourth quarter is going to be very strong. And so I think you want to be buying some of the volatility." Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said he was favoring the market's leading large-cap names as stocks head into their historical period of weakness. That's because there's potential for inflation to climb higher, which means the Fed may cut rates less than markets currently expect. Anticipated rate cuts are a major reason why small and mid-cap stocks have rallied in recent weeks. "What does that mean? Well, I stick with who brought you to the dance. Those large caps," he told CNBC last week, adding that he also had exposure to areas like industrials and financials. "We're not overweight small- and mid-caps here." "You look at the kind of leadership, I love it. What's even lagging, like even more," he added, pointing to large-cap laggards in areas like consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Stocks also had strong momentum heading out of August, which is a positive sign for equities even amid seasonal weakness, Detrick said. At the end of the second-to-last week of the month, 90% of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were in the green. That's an extremely rare occurrence in financial markets, with only 12 instances of that happening since 1980, he said. "So even if we have a little seasonal weakness, after a 30% rally, I think it's going to be contained," Detrick said of any coming pullback. Jump to

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 2, 2025)

Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:53:06Z
Full Content:
The explosion of competition in semi-liquid funds could lead to fee compression, according to FundFire. The ETF market is becoming flooded with “slop”, writes ETF.com. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 2, 2025 What’s Next for Semi-Liquid Funds? Fee Compression “Managers rushing to develop alts strategies for the advisor market have not only been chasing vast sums of high-net-worth capital but also the prospect of higher fees than they can generate from mutual funds or private vehicles. And managers have mostly found investors willing to pay the base fees for semi-liquid alts funds.” (FundFire) ETF Slop: How Wall Street Flooded the Market With Gimmick Funds “Just as AI slop means endless articles, videos, and posts that are easy to create and empty of substance, ETF slop means endless new tickers that deliver little of lasting value. So far in 2025, issuers have launched nearly 700 ETFs, already close to last year’s record with four months still left to go. With more than 4,600 ETFs now listed in the U.S., about 15% of the entire market has been born this year alone. And much of it is slop.” (ETF.com) What Investors Need to Know About Private Assets Managers “Traditional public market asset managers have partnered with alternatives managers to develop strategies. For the managers, it seems like a win-win situation: Public market asset managers get quicker and probably cheaper access to private asset deals and operational insight, while private market managers get an “in” to public market asset managers’ existing retail or wealth channel distribution networks.” (Morningstar) Vanguard Hires Nuveen’s Stout to Head Private Markets Strategy “Vanguard Group hired an outsider to head its strategy for private markets, signaling that Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji intends to make a bigger push into the asset class.” (Bloomberg) Why You Should Pay Attention to Active ETFs “Active managers long held out on ETFs because of their daily transparency. Some companies went to great lengths to create nontransparent ETFs for this reason. But the benefit of opacity is unclear for investors.” (Morningstar) Why Apollo CEO Marc Rowan says the traditional investing model is ‘broken’ “With the stock market increasingly driven by passive investing and indexing, and dominated by a handful of mega-tech stocks, investors seeking diversification will need to start turning to the rapidly expanding private markets, Rowan told CNBC.” (CNBC) Alts Demand Driving Up Specialist Pay, Divisional Head Hires “Asset managers are ponying up more to hire product specialists as demand for alternative investments intensifies – and they're bringing on additional divisional leaders to support the growing mix of specialists and generalists. Average total compensation for advisor-facing specialists reached $322,563 in the second quarter of 2025, up nearly 13% from a year earlier, according to data from Cerulli Associates.” (FundFire) US sliding towards 1930s-style autocracy, warns Ray Dalio “Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned Donald Trump’s America is drifting into 1930s-style autocratic politics — and said other investors are too scared of the president to speak up.” (Financial Times) How BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are bringing Wall Street’s hottest asset class to 401(k)s “Wall Street’s largest firms are championing a new cause. They are bringing alternative assets — once reserved for the ultra-wealthy — to the portfolios of individual investors.” (CNBC) REITs Own 570,000 Properties in the U.S. “Data centers had the largest year-over-year increase, up 15% from 2023 to 352 properties at the end of 2024. Retail, storage, and apartment property types all had increases of 30% or more since 2018, with retail up 39%, storage up 33%, and apartment up 30%. Retail also had the second highest annual increase, up 9%.” (Nareit) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: Prospective Thames Water rescuers make big promise

A consortium of Thames Water creditors is seeking the agreement of the regulator for its updated operational investment proposals to avert the prospect of being wiped out, should their rescue bid fail. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 September 2025 00:12, UK The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: "Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. "Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. "This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust."

A major challenge for the consortium is convincing officials that it has the experience and people behind it to meet the demands of running a water company of Thames Water's size, serving about a quarter of the country's population.

Title: Texas Suit V. Blackrock Et Al Could Undermine Trump’s Energy Agenda
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/02/texas-suit-v-blackrock-et-al-could-undermine-trumps-energy-agenda/
Time Published: 2025-09-02T13:59:33Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. In a move demonstrating that big oil companies aren’t the only targets of energy-related lawsuits, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas AG Ken Paxton recently sued major investment firms including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The complaint, filed last December in a Texas federal court, alleges that the defendants illegally colluded to buy up stock in various coal companies and force them to lower output via implementation of internal ESG-focused policies. Mr. Paxton said in a press release introducing the lawsuit that the big investment firms have created a “cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” adding, “their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But U.S. coal prices have dropped dramatically since 2023, and overall coal production has been in decline throughout the 21st century. Despite coal’s decline, America’s mineral energy renaissance has transformed our country’s outlook, enhancing its energy security in the process. Once heavily dependent on foreign suppliers to meet demand, last year the U.S. produced more mineral energy than ever before – and output is projected to increase further this year. This extraordinary turnaround is in large part the result of free markets being allowed to do what they do best: compete. This is certainly the case in the oil and gas business, where thousands of producers ranging from small mom-and-pop operators to the biggest major integrated companies in the world compete in a vibrant marketplace. It has even remained true in the coal industry despite an array of command-and-control interventions enacted during both the Obama and Biden presidencies. Mr. Paxton and some of the Republican AGs who have signed onto the plaintiff coalition have been outspoken proponents of President Donald Trump and his efforts to reverse much of the Biden and Obama regulatory morass. So, regardless of the merits of the complaint, it is at least interesting that the group’s lawsuit proposes a big government solution. That proposed remedy asks that that the government force these asset managers to divest their holdings in coal companies entirely, a move that could strip the industry of nearly $18 billion in capital. That could be ruinous to a sector which has been in decline for decades. It would also present real trouble for Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s goal of delaying planned retirements of more than 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, which he discussed in President Trump’s August 26 cabinet meeting. After all, it costs real money to pay for the upkeep and operations of that many coal power plants. Somebody has to foot the bill, and it won’t be the federal government. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as Energy Secretary throughout the first Trump presidency from 2017-2021, called the lawsuit "misguided" last month in a Washington Times op-ed. Perry warned that a decision for the plaintiffs would likely undermine Trump's energy agenda, calling the case “not conservative. That’s not pro-business. And it’s certainly not pro-energy dominance.” Surely, there must be more constructive ways to debate energy policy. In fact, the last election served in many ways as a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration’s aggressive green agenda – one that Trump and his cabinet officials say made a mess of America’s energy security. Should the plaintiff states prevail in this case, what would that mean for the many oil and gas companies who adopted many of the same ESG-focused internal policies which these coal companies implemented in their efforts to adapt to the political and market realities of the moment to maximize investor returns? Those companies were advised every day of every week for years to move in that direction by an array of major advisory firms for whose advice they paid millions of dollars. This kind of litigation also raises the specter of the tables being reversed whenever the political pendulum swings back in the other direction, which it inevitably will do. The resulting tit-for-tat governance might chill investment and raise the cost of capital at precisely the time when large-scale energy investments are most needed. During the 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to reinvigorate “beautiful, clean coal” as part of an all-of-the-above energy plan – a laudable goal to meet America’s rapidly growing energy needs. Shoring up resilience and reliability on the nation’s power grids by ensuring the maintenance of adequate 24/7 baseload generating capacity is a major piece of that agenda. Secretary Wright and other Trump officials believe coal still has a big role to play in that space. Achieving the President’s vision will require serious investment by the private sector as government subsidies are gradually removed from the equation, and much of that capital investment must be provided by the defendant firms in this case. Policymakers should be working to unleash capital markets, not jam them up. But, despite that reality, the Trump Justice Department’s antitrust division and Federal Trade Commission tacitly endorsed the lawsuit in July with the filing of a statement of interest, saying the actions by the defendants could reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. This begs the question of who the agencies believe will step in to pony up $18 billion in new capital to fund the ongoing operations of the 100 gw of coal plants Sec. Wright wants to keep in operation if the government forces this mass divestiture. It isn’t as if alternative investors are clamoring at the gates to invest in the coal business these days. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this litigation targeting Blackrock and other big investment houses, it serves to vividly illustrate the complexities endemic to investing big money in the energy business in the United States today. None of this is simple or easy: If it was, everybody would be doing it.

New CEO Jerry Dempsey St John of God religious order Brothers are to step away from its health and hospital organisation as a new group chief executive was announced today. Jerry Dempsey will take over the St John of God Hospitaller Services Group (SJOG HSG). It includes the St John of God Hospital in Dublin and St John of God Community Services, which deliver intellectual disability and community mental health services at various locations throughout Ireland. It was announced today that Mr Dempsey will bring 25 years of executive management experience with a background spanning healthcare services, pharmaceuticals and environmental services in Ireland, the UK, and the USA. New CEO Jerry Dempsey Today's News in 90 seconds - September 2nd He has “extensive experience leading mission-driven organisations in regulated multi-stakeholder environments where trust, compliance and service quality are paramount", according to a spokesperson. “Previous roles held include Managing Director of Greenstar, CEO of Ashfield Healthcare USA and Chief Commercial Officer of healthcare and life sciences company Complete Laboratory Solutions. Jerry has led organisations through periods of significant growth and transformation while successfully balancing commercial acumen and financial sustainability underpinned by a strong person-centred approach,” they said. “His breadth of experience positions him to professionally progress the ongoing transformation of St John of God Hospitaller Services Group and its affiliated entities, while championing the enduring values of compassion, hospitality and respect that are central to the mission and purpose of St John of God.” A spokesperson said the announcement coincides with further changes in board membership arrangements in line with ongoing governance reforms. The formation of SJOG HSG commenced in 2006 when the Hospitaller Order of St John of God (the Order) began planning for a future where the Brothers would no longer lead the mission, due to advancing age and declining vocations. A series of developments over the intervening years has led to a planned reduction of Order involvement across both the operations and governance of the SJOG entities, they said. “The next phase of the ongoing transition process will see the remaining Irish and UK Brothers now stepping down from the SJOG HSG and SJOG Malawi Boards and transitioning off all remaining entity Boards by the end of 2025. This will mark a pivotal moment in the organisation's evolution, entrusting leadership and governance fully in the hands of committed lay people,” they added. Mr Dempsey said: "I am honoured to take up the role of Group CEO at this transformative time for the St John of God Group. The Order has laid a remarkable foundation for the task ahead with over a century and half of dedicated service and leadership. "I am confident we can continue to fulfill the mission of Saint John of God by building a cohesive, resilient and sustainable future, adapting to emerging requirements and meeting unmet need while delivering impactful, compassionate care to those in need. Ensuring the dignity and well-being of the people we are entrusted to support and helping them to reach their full potential, remains our central focus." Dr Tony Hanna, chair of the board added: “We are delighted to confirm Jerry Dempsey’s appointment as Group CEO. He brings a wealth of professional experience and corporate expertise to this role as we enter a new era in the Group’s development. We acknowledge the invaluable contribution the Order has made over the past 150 years in helping the most vulnerable in our society. We will continue to lead the services with the utmost respect and commitment to that legacy.” In June, Aidan Clohessy, a former school principal was convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30 year period and jailed for four years. He was principal of ST Augustine’s School in Blackrock from the early 1970s to 1993. He entered the St John of God religious order in 1958. In a statement, the Order of Saint John of God said it has “long recognised the need and desire for lay people to exercise greater leadership roles in the governance of the works and services of the West European Province, which includes Ireland”. The Order also recognised that there was a desire of lay people to play an active and leadership role in promoting, expanding and furthering the mission and that lay people would bring "particular and valued experience and expertise in meeting the needs of people and also enhance overall governance”. To support this vision, and mindful of the declining number of Brothers and their age profiles, a process was initiated with the primary aim of ensuring the continuation into the future, of the mission and work of the Order of Saint John of God, it added.
