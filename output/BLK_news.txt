Title: Telegram revenue jumps to $870M in H1 2025; $2B full-year target: FT

Telegram’s H1 2025 revenue climbed 65% to $870 million, while Toncoin write-downs and $500 million in frozen bonds have added pressure. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan. 6, 1:20 pm UTC): This article has been updated with a statement from Telegram. Cryptocurrency-friendly messenger Telegram boosted its operating revenue in 2025 as it explores a potential initial public offering (IPO). Telegram’s revenues hit $870 million in the first half of 2025, up 65% from $525 million a year earlier, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unaudited financial statements. About a third of that, or $300 million, came from “exclusivity agreements,” linked to earnings related to Telegram-connected cryptocurrency Toncoin (TON). The report also said that $500 million of Telegram’s bonds have been frozen in Russia’s central securities depository due to Western sanctions, the FT said, citing anonymous sources. Telegram posted a net loss of more than $220 million in H1 2025, compared with a $334 net profit in the first half of the previous year. The company targets $2 billion in revenue in 2025. The loss reportedly came from Telegram having to write down the value of its holdings in Toncoin, which lost 69% of its value in 2025, according to CoinGecko. “The company told investors it had sold more than $450 million in Toncoin in the year to date,” the report said. By publishing time, the amount would account for about 10% of TON’s market capitalization of $4.6 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Addressing the bond freeze in Russia, a spokesperson for Telegram said that $500 million figure refers to a bond issue from 2021. The representative noted that Telegram’s latest bond offering in 2025 excluded participation by Russian investors. “Telegram is not dependent on Russia or Russian capital and does not face bond-related issues due to sanctions,” the spokesperson said, adding: Telegram launched several bond offerings in recent years, including a $1.7 billion convertible bond offering issued in May 2025. The sale reportedly featured existing backers, including investment giant BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala. According to FT sources, Telegram bought back most of the bonds maturing in 2026. Related: ‘Mixed year for IPOs’ as crypto pulls down US IPO performance The report comes amid Telegram CEO Pavel Durov remaining under formal investigation in France over the platform’s alleged failure to address criminality, including child abuse content. In a recent call with some bondholders, Telegram reportedly said it continued to cooperate with authorities regarding Durov’s case and that it needed more resolution before the company could proceed with a public market listing. Cointelegraph also sought comment from Telegram on its 2025 financials and TON holdings, but the company did not address either in its response.

Title: Morgan Stanley files S-1s for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in latest crypto push

Time Published: 2026-01-06T12:48:39Z

The investment banking giant’s filings for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs follow an uptick in investor demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles, driven by the new year’s “clean-slate” effect. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update Jan. 6, 12:57 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include a paragraph on Morgan Stanley’s prior involvement with cryptocurrency funds. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one tied to Bitcoin and the other to Solana, as Wall Street firms push deeper into regulated digital-asset products. The proposed Morgan Stanley Bitcoin (BTC) Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana (SOL) Trust will function as “passive investment” vehicles that hold and track the performance of the underlying tokens, according to Tuesday’s filings with the SEC. The two funds seek to list their shares on public exchanges, which are usually specified in later 19b-4 filings, not the initial S-1 forms. If approved, the funds could bring new inflows to Bitcoin and Solana from Morgan Stanley’s over 19 million clients served through its wealth management division as of April 2025, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.1 billion in inflows during the first two trading days of 2026, as analysts pointed to renewed digital asset appetite due to the new year’s “clean-slate effect.” Related: Strategy kickstarts 2026 with $116M Bitcoin buy as Q4 paper loss hits $17B Morgan Stanley Investment Management is listed as the sponsor for both proposed trusts. CSC Delaware Trust Company is named as the Delaware trustee. Key service providers, including certain custodial arrangements, were not fully specified in the preliminary documents. Morgan Stanley said it will keep a “substantial portion of the private keys” in cold storage with a “remainder” held in hot wallets. The two funds won’t seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of the underlying asset, meaning that the sponsor won’t “speculatively sell” the spot tokens. Morgan Stanley has been deepening its involvement with the cryptocurrency industry along with other big financial institutions. In October, the wealth manager reportedly enabled its financial advisors to recommend crypto funds to clients with individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s, marking a significant policy shift from previously restricting access to high-net-worth individuals with over $1.5 million in assets. Related: $675M Lighter airdrop ranks among crypto’s 10 largest: Bubblemaps Morgan Stanley’s ETF filings add to a growing institutional interest in regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles. It comes a day after the second-largest US bank, Bank of America, began allowing advisers in its wealth management businesses to recommend exposure to four Bitcoin ETFs, Cointelegraph reported on Monday. The move allows the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which can now be recommended by the bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers across its Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients in December 2025, a year after BlackRock recommended an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, as the first large financial institution to do so, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024.

Title: Circle's USDC outpaces growth of Tether's USDT for second year running
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/06/circle-s-usdc-outpaces-growth-of-tether-s-usdt-for-second-year-running
Time Published: 2026-01-06T12:41:26Z
Full Content:
Circle Internet's (CRCL) dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, grew faster than larger rival Tether's USDT for the second straight year in 2025, fueled by rising demand for regulated, blockchain-based dollars as the U.S. government warmed to digital assets. USDC's market capitalization increased 73% to $75.12 billion while USDT added 36% to $186.6 billion, according to CoinDesk data. In 2024, USDC grew by 77% compared with USDT's 50%. Circle Internet, based in New York, was founded in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville and went public on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in last June. USDC is backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries held at regulated institutions. In the U.S., Circle holds money transmission licenses in various states and territories, as well as a virtual currency license in the State of New York. In Europe, it complies with the MiCA framework post-2024 and operates under e-money licenses in key jurisdictions. Tether's USDT remains unregulated in the U.S. and Europe. The company, founded in 2014 and led by CEO Paolo Ardoino, operates as a licensed digital asset service provider in El Salvador. Tether did not respond to an emailed request for comment. USDC's outperformance seems to be rooted in institutional demand for assets that meet regulatory guidelines, observers noted. The GENUIS Act created a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins and digital tokens pegged to monetary value and intended for payments. That prompted several high-profile investment banks and institutions to explore stablecoins, particularly regulated ones such as the USDC. The token, for example, has been actively integrated and preferred by companies including Visa, Mastercard and BlackRock, primarily for settlement and treasury operations. "USDC's transparent reserve management and regular audits make it more trustworthy among institutional investors and other regulated entities," analysts at JPMorgan said in a note in October. "Additionally, its compliance with frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe sets it apart from competitors, making USDC the preferred stablecoin for financial institutions," they added. USDC and USDT together account for over 80% of the total stablecoin market value of $312 billion, a sign that other tokens have yet to catch benefit from regulatory developments in the world's largest economy. "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly stated that the stablecoin market could grow to USD 3.7T by the end of the decade. In this context, it remains to be seen whether stablecoin growth will remain confined to USDt and USDC, or will expand meaningfully to other tokens," analyst at FRNT Financial said in a Friday newsletter. "Nevertheless, crypto proponents are optimistic that stablecoin proliferation will bring new capital and users into the crypto ecosystem in 2026," they added.

Title: BlackRock is back to accumulating, snaps up nearly $500 mln in Bitcoin, Ethereum
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrock-is-back-to-accumulating-snaps-up-nearly-500-mln-in-bitcoin-ethereum-details/
Time Published: 2026-01-06T12:30:58Z
Full Content:
What changed in the first week of 2026? Institutional capital is coming back, and it’s largely going through BlackRock. Following a choppy Q4 in 2025, where ETF volumes struggled to find a floor, the first week of 2026 has delivered a massive liquidity injection. On-chain data and fund flows confirm that BlackRock clients have snapped up 3,948 Bitcoin [BTC] worth $371.89 million and 31,737 Ethereum [ETH] worth $100.23 million. This signals that institutions don’t drop half a billion dollars unless they expect the market to strengthen. In fact, this kind of synchronized BTC + ETH accumulation often happens when institutions expect higher prices soon. On the ETF front, the 5th of January marked a rebound for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Data from Farside Investors shows an extraordinary $697.2 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows in a single day. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $372.5 million, over half of all inflows. Meanwhile, its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, secured $102.9 million out of the sector’s $168 million total. This surge in capital coincided with a broader market recovery, pushing Bitcoin to $93,700.64 and Ethereum to $3,234.78. At the same time, corporate holders are also signaling renewed confidence. Strategy, despite suffering a steep 43% stock decline during the 2025 crypto downturn, remains the world’s largest public Bitcoin treasury with over 673,783 BTC. In fact, on the 4th of January, Michael Saylor reignited speculation when he hinted at further Bitcoin accumulation on X. Yet perhaps the most transformative development comes from Grayscale. On the 5th of January, the firm announced the first-ever U.S. spot crypto ETP payout derived from staking rewards for its Ethereum Staking ETF (ETHE). Investors received $0.083178 per share, with the distribution covering rewards accrued from October to December 2025. This introduces passive income to Ethereum holders within traditional brokerage accounts, shifting ETH from a purely speculative asset to a yield-generating one. These developments follow a dramatic year-end contrast between two of the market’s biggest players. During the holiday slowdown, BlackRock quietly shifted $214 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime to manage ETF redemptions. Meanwhile, on the other hand, Saylor’s Strategy moved in the opposite direction. On the same day, Strategy purchased 1,229 BTC worth $108.85 million, boosting its holdings to 672,497 BTC. All this combined signals that the weak hands are exiting and the strongest hands are accumulating, setting the tone for what may come next in 2026.

Title: Morgan Stanley targets crypto ETF market with bitcoin, solana filings
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/06/morgan-stanley-eyes-the-spot-bitcoin-etf-market
Time Published: 2026-01-06T11:37:24Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot bitcoin BTC$92,783.58 exchange-traded fund (ETF) and solana trust, pushing its digital assets ambitions further. The BTC product, called the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust, is structured as an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of bitcoin, net of fees and expenses, according to a Form S-1 submitted on Jan. 6. If approved, the fund’s shares are expected to list on a national securities exchange under a ticker symbol that has not yet been disclosed. The bitcoin trust is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and will hold bitcoin directly rather than using derivatives or leverage. Its net asset value will be calculated daily using a designated bitcoin pricing benchmark derived from activity on major spot exchanges. The fund will be passive and will not attempt to trade bitcoin based on market conditions. Shares will be created and redeemed only in large blocks by authorized participants, either in cash or in kind. Cash transactions will be executed through third-party bitcoin counterparties selected by the sponsor. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares on the secondary market through brokerage accounts. Morgan Stanley’s filing follows the rapid expansion of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market over the past two years. SoSoValue data shows these now have $123 billion in total net assets, equivalent to 6.57% of bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Since the start of the year, net inflows to these products have topped $1.1 billion. Morgan Stanley has also filed a Form S-1 with the SEC for the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, meant to track the price of solana. These funds, as data shows, have grown to more than $1 billion in total net assets, following a total cumulative net inflow of nearly $800 million. The filings show Morgan Stanley shifting from simply distributing third-party crypto products to building its own in-house vehicles, signaling a deeper, higher-conviction commitment to digital assets. This pivot is likely driven by the robust economics of the ETF and trust business, underscored by the substantial fee revenue traditional finance firms have generated from spot bitcoin products in a short period. For example, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETFs became the firm's top revenue source in November of last year, according to BlackRock Brazil’s director of business development, Cristiano Castro, with allocations nearing $100 billion. Unlike asset managers such as BlackRock, Morgan Stanley operates a massive wealth management arm with thousands of advisors that opened crypto access to clients in October last year. By leveraging its own ETFs, the bank can vertically integrate these products into its client portfolios, keeping management fees in-house rather than paying them to competitors.

Title: XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In 2025, XRP emerged as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has continued this upward trend, recording a 17% surge over the past week that has propelled its price back above the key $2.20 threshold. One of the prominent factors contributing to this surge is the strong performance of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which became a standout in the market by attracting $483 million over the past weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products faced a loss of $564 million. XRP funds not only achieved $483 million in inflows during December but also maintained a steady influx for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak finally ended on December 26 with the first day of zero inflows. Overall, since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP exchange-traded funds have amassed to $1.3 billion, marking the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. Looking ahead, reports suggest that the ETF landscape could be pivotal in shaping bullish scenarios for XRP. A potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could serve as a significant credibility boost, attracting conservative institutional investors to the space. BlackRock’s own $40 billion Bitcoin ETF exemplifies the capacity to mobilize capital effectively through its Aladdin platform connections. Additionally, the scaling of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into banking and remittance services could generate ongoing demand for XRP as a critical bridge asset. There are also signs that the Federal Reserve could implement several rate cuts in 2026, which would lower the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. Under such conditions, it is alleged that the XRP price might break through its all-time high of $3.84, potentially escalating toward the $4.00 to $5.00 range by year-end. When it comes to price action, market analyst Dark Defender, active on the social media platform X (previously Twitter), recently highlighted XRP’s price action by providing a three-month time frame update. The analyst noted that a newly initiated green candle in January exhibits a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to Dark Defender, surpassing the $2.22 level is crucial for XRP. He further suggested that XRP could be on the brink of a significant surge, similar to silver, and pointed to ambitious targets such as $6 and even as high as $20 in the future. Achieving $6 would represent a notable 171% increase from current trading prices, while reaching the $20 mark would indicate a staggering 800% rise. While trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, the token is still facing $2.22 as the next major short-term resistance level, and is also trading at 40% below its all-time high.

Title: Ice warning may cause further disruption as cold snap continues

A fresh weather warning for icy conditions in Northern Ireland has come into force as the cold snap continues to cause disruption. More than 200 schools in Northern Ireland were closed on Tuesday and a number of Translink services were affected. The police warned that some roads in County Fermanagh were "impassable due to treacherous icy conditions" including Moybrone Road, Letterbreen and Tiravally Road, and Florencecourt. A yellow weather warning for ice ended at 10:00 GMT on Tuesday but a new one is in place from 18:00 until 11:00 on Wednesday. A fresh dusting of snow can also be expected in some areas. The Met Office has urged the public to take care on slippery footpaths and untreated roads. Tuesday's school closures were mainly in the north east, north west and west of Northern Ireland. Three schools in Northern Ireland are due to be closed on Wednesday. Bin collections in various council areas have been disrupted by the weather. In Derry and Strabane District Council all cemeteries remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Recycling centres there have reopened, with the exception of Spamont and Park. Sports pitches at Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council remain closed. Donemana sheep farmer Matthew Craig said it had been difficult to get about to feed his animals in recent days. "It's really been like an ice rink," he said. Craig is also balancing childcare and farming as daughters Anna and Beth have been off school, while their mum has been working. Brian Guthrie, the principal of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, had hoped to reopen on Tuesday but conditions did not allow it. "I spent a good bit of time on site yesterday, clearing pathways and so on to make it safe but, unfortunately, as the day went on it seemed more and more schools were making a call to close," he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. He said the Foyle Learning Community – a network of 13 schools, which includes Foyle College – made a decision to close, so he was left with no choice but to do the same. "It isn't an easy decision and I know it has an impact on parents, the children and learning and apologies for that but it's really about making sure our school community is safe." Emma Tsang has three children and lives in the Ballymoney area. A number of local schools were closed, including those attended by her children, as well as their childcare facility. Tsang said she respected the decision to close schools, as the safety of children and staff is paramount, but added it was "not ideal". "It's a difficult situation for working parents to organise alternative childcare at short notice," she said. St Brigid's Primary School in Tirkane in County Londonderry was among the closed schools. Its principal Ursula O'Hanlon said the snow and ice had not thawed, adding that she could not expect parents to get children to school when buses were not servicing local roads. "Nobody wants to be responsible for opening a school and hearing then that someone had an accident," she said. Paddy Lavery, a principal engineer at the Department of Infrastructure, said there were more than 300 staff members working to keep the main roads open and safe. Lavery said rural schools will always be a "difficulty" but there are special arrangements to treat some roads. They follow a scoring mechanism to decide where resources will be deployed. This includes assessing whether there has been a history of snow and ice around the school, if there is a bus with over 40 seats travelling to the school and the number of vehicles travelling to the school. Lavery said there is an application process for rural roads to be treated, adding that over 50 schools are treated under special arrangements. Hospital entrances are also treated under these arrangements. Scarlett,10, Alesha, 6, and Dan, 8, were playing in the snow in Cullybackey. "Well what I love about the snow is that I can get it and throw it at him [Dan]," Scarlett told BBC News NI. She added that they had sleighs at their granny's house which is "the best thing". Dan said he likes to throw snowballs at his sister and "push her down in the snow because I know she won't get hurt". Their father, Steven, said the children are "having a lot of fun" but they do love school. In County Down, the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team was deployed to help health workers and carers make essential calls to patients' homes. Volunteers used 4x4 rescue vehicles to transport carers to houses that are difficult to reach in icy weather. "A lot of the side roads and laneways and so on have become very treacherous," said Martin McMullan from the team. "There's obviously a lot of people living in our community now, particularly in the rural community, with quite acute care needs - not just the elderly." Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Older People, Siobhan Casey, called on people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the cold snap. NI Water urged people to be careful around its outdoor sites, particularly reservoirs and dams, where winter conditions can create hazards. Reservoir safety and compliance area manager Derek McKane said ice was "nearly always treacherous" and people should not attempt to walk or skate on iced-over reservoirs. "Reservoirs are not safe places to play at any time of year, but winter brings extra dangers," he added. Mike Nesbitt announced last week that he would step down from his second stint as leader of the party. A man in his 20s has been seriously injured in a crash between a car and a lorry in Augher. More than 700 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport alone on Wednesday. The Met Office warning covering all of Scotland apart from Shetland is from 22:00 on Wednesday until noon on Thursday.

Chinese automaker BYD reported a nearly 28% increase in December sales, with total 2025 deliveries (BEVs and plug-in hybrids) reaching 4.6 million vehicles, while Tesla's 2026 projected sales are 1.6 millionÂ â down from 1.79 million in 2024. BYD offers a wide range of vehicles, including compact cars, sedans, SUVs, buses and commercial EVs, whereas Tesla's lineup is limited to the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck (with future models not yet mainstream). Analysts link Teslaâs sales decline partly to Elon Musk's political engagement, including controversial statements on European politics, immigration and diversity following his acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). A Yale University study estimated Teslaâs sales could have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding 1â1.26 million vehicles. Musk's actions reportedly boosted sales of rival electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market.

Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market. The global electric vehicle (EV) market appears to be tilting in favor of Chinese automaker BYD, as Tesla struggles to maintain its once-dominant position. Tesla sold an estimated 480,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2025 and around 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Total sales for 2026 are projected at 1.6 million units, down from approximately 1.79 million in 2024. In contrast, BYD sold roughly 1.7 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2024 and around 2.25 million in 2025, with total deliveries, including BEVs and plug-in hybrids, reaching 4.6 million vehicles in 2025. BYD, as per BrightU.AI's Enoch, is a Chinese multinational automotive manufacturer established in 1995. It initially focused on battery production before expanding intoÂ EVs and plug-in hybrids. BYD's diverse lineup includes compact city cars, premium sedans, large SUVs, hybrid models and electric buses and commercial vehicles, giving it a broad presence in markets worldwide. Meanwhile, Tesla's current portfolio consists of the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck in limited volumes, with vehicles like the Roadster and low-cost robotaxi-style EVs not yet available to mainstream buyers. Analysts: Musk's politics cost Tesla over a million sales Analysts suggest that Tesla's sales underperformance is partly linked to founder Elon Musk's high-profile political activities. Following his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk increasingly voiced opinions on European politics, immigration and diversity initiatives, drawing criticism and controversy. A Yale University study published in October found that Tesla's sales would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding one million to 1.26 million vehicles sold. The study also concluded that Musk's actions boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. "This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be," the researchers wrote. "We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business." Musk further amplified his political engagement by backing President Donald Trump and Republican causes, including a reported $288 million contribution to Trump-aligned committees during the 2024 election cycle. After Trump's return to office, Musk was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Once regarded as the benchmark for cutting-edge EV technology and environmental progress, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding range and consistent sales growth highlight the shifting dynamics of the global electric vehicle market.

Title: Hilton called out by DHS after the department said ICE agents' reservations were canceled at an independently owned Hampton Inn

The Department of Homeland Security singled out Hilton on X, saying a hotel in Minnesota canceled reservations belonging to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. According to a screenshot shared by DHS on Monday, a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, south of Minneapolis, said it was "not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property." "If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation," the screenshot said. Hilton said it doesn't own or operate the hotel. The company's shares were down nearly 2.5% on Monday. "This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values," Hilton said in a statement to Business Insider. "We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies." "Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination," the statement said. Everpeak Hospitality, the owner of the hotel, said in a statement Tuesday that the incident was "inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all." "We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated," the statement said. "We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted." DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Hilton's largest known shareholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which respectively own 10.6% and 8.5% of its common stock, according to the company's 2025 proxy statement. Hilton, like other global hotel chains, does not own most Hilton-branded hotels. Instead, most of its hotels are franchised — they're owned and operated independently or owned by a third party and operated by Hilton. Jump to

Title: Why Are The Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Prices Rising?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising today, with the flagship crypto rising to as high as $93,000. This market rally comes on the back of several factors, including the U.S.-Venezuela escalations, which have increased risk sentiment. In an X post, market commentator The Kobeissi Letter noted that risky assets seem to be gaining momentum despite the U.S. capture of former Venezuelan president Maduro. This suggests risk sentiment may be back after the year-end decline in 2025, which has contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are also rising on the back of an increase in the M2 money supply, which now stands at $22.4 trillion, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. This is bullish for crypto assets as some of this liquidity is expected to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, the U.S. debt continues to rise, standing at $38.6 trillion, a development that is bullish for crypto as investors hedge against inflation by allocating to these asset classes. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Fed has also been carrying out its Reserve Management Purchases (RMP), which experts such as James Lavish have described as a form of quantitative easing (QE), which is positive for the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has even predicted that BTC could rally to as high as $200,000 on the back of this move from the Fed. Meanwhile, the Fed has also been injecting liquidity into the economy through the New York Fed’s repo operations. Market analyst Ted Pilliows also suggested that the crypto bulls are back in control, which is why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin prices are rising. In an X post, he noted that BTC has large sell orders from the $92,000 to $95,000 level on Binance. Ted added that if bulls push BTC above the $95,000 level, there is very little resistance until $100,000, suggesting a rally to this psychological level could be on the cards. In another X post, the market analyst noted that the Coinbase Bitcoin premium is recovering, with institutional demand for BTC picking up again. SoSoValue data show that Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $471.14 million on January 2, their largest since December 17. A sustained daily net inflow could lead to higher prices for BTC, which is also a positive for the Ethereum and Dogecoin prices. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $92,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Diplomatic crisis between the US & Panama ends: Panama Canal remains under Panamanian administration
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2026/01/05/diplomatic-crisis-between-the-us-panama-ends-panama-canal-remains-under-panamanian-administration/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T18:04:08Z
Full Content:
President José Raúl Mulino declared the crisis “a thing of the past” in his New Year’s message to the National Assembly. He reaffirmed that the Panama Canal “remains and will remain under Panamanian sovereignty.” His remarks follow a period of intense diplomatic tension that began in early 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened to reassert U.S. control over the strategic waterway, citing growing Chinese influence. Mulino stated that, through “a steady stance and time,” both sides had succeeded in restoring mutual respect and cooperation. He emphasized that Panama’s relationship with the U.S. is now based on collaboration, trust, and friendship, with particular focus on joint efforts to combat international crime. Tensions escalated immediately after Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, 2025. The U.S. president pressured the Panamanian government to revoke the contract of the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports Group, which operates two key ports at the Canal’s Atlantic and Pacific entrances. Simultaneously, Washington demanded that U.S. ships transit the Canal without paying fees—a move Panama viewed as a direct challenge to its sovereignty. Chinese Objections and Port Management Despite the diplomatic détente with the U.S., the future of port management in Panama remains uncertain. In March 2025, CK Hutchison reached a preliminary agreement to sell 80% of its global port operations—including the two Panamanian ports—to a consortium led by BlackRock and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), part of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). However, negotiations have stalled, reportedly due to opposition from Beijing, which seeks a substantial role for China’s Cosco Shipping in the new entity. At the same time, Hutchison’s concession agreement with Panama is being challenged in court as unconstitutional, with the Supreme Court expected to issue a ruling later this month. Canal Celebrates 26 Years of Panamanian Control On December 31, 2025, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) celebrated 26 years since control of the Canal was transferred from the United States to Panama in 1999. The Canal continues to be the backbone of Panama’s economy and a vital hub for global maritime trade. Official figures show that the ACP has transferred approximately $31.2 billion to the national treasury over the past 26 years, supporting public investment and government revenues. In November 2025, the ACP unveiled an ambitious long-term investment plan to maintain the Canal’s competitiveness, including projects in port infrastructure, energy logistics, and water resource management. Amid growing geopolitical rivalries, Panama seeks to balance relations with major powers while safeguarding control of one of the world’s most strategic maritime passages. Explore related questions

Title: Grayscale declares first Ethereum staking payout for US-listed ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-us-payout-ethereum-staking-rewards
Time Published: 2026-01-05T17:46:28Z

The cash distribution stems from staking rewards earned after the fund enabled Ethereum staking in October. Cointelegraph in your social feed Grayscale has declared a staking rewards distribution for its Ethereum Staking exchange-traded fund (ETF), the first time a US-listed spot crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) has scheduled a payout tied to onchain staking activity. Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) shareholders will receive about $0.08 per share from proceeds of the sale of staking rewards, with the payout scheduled for Tuesday based on holdings recorded at market close on Monday, according to a press release published on Monday. Grayscale activated staking for its Ethereum products on Oct. 6, with staking conducted through institutional custodians and third-party validator providers. The move made ETHE and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) the first US-listed spot crypto ETPs to gain exposure to Ether staking. Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency on a proof-of-stake blockchain to help validate transactions and secure the network in exchange for periodic rewards. In the case of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF, rewards are converted to cash and distributed to investors in dollars rather than being paid out in Ether (ETH). Grayscale’s funds operate outside the Investment Company Act of 1940, the primary statute governing US ETFs, a structure that permits staking but carries different regulatory protections as traditional US ETFs. Founded in 2013, Grayscale Investments is a digital asset manager that sponsors crypto investment products, with about $31 billion in assets under management, according to the company. The ETF was up around 2% in early-day trading, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Bank of America lets wealth advisers recommend Bitcoin ETFs While Grayscale is currently the only US-traded fund to issue payouts linked to Ether staking, several spot Ether ETFs from major asset managers are awaiting regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, Cboe BZX filed a proposed rule change with US regulators seeking approval to add staking to the Fidelity Ethereum Fund. The proposal would allow the fund to stake some or all of its Ether through third-party providers, and followed a similar filing submitted in February for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. In November, BlackRock registered a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund in Delaware, an early procedural step toward launching a staking-enabled product that would sit alongside its existing spot Ether ETF. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which launched in July 2024, currently does not include staking. US spot Ether ETFs began trading in July 2024, making 2025 the first full calendar year in which they were available to investors. During the year, the funds attracted $9.6 billion in inflows. According to CoinMarketCap data, US spot Ether ETFs collectively manage about $18 billion in assets. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) is the largest by market cap at roughly $11.1 billion, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE with about $4.1 billion and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF at around $1.5 billion.

Title: Data Centers Continue to Vacuum Up the Investment Dollars — Is the Return Worth It?
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2026/01/data-centers-return-investment-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T14:48:49Z

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If 2025 will be remembered for anything — outside of the return of President Donald J. Trump and the rise of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani — it will undoubtedly be the establishment of artificial intelligence across the American economy. And with this revolutionary technology has come the concomitant explosion of U.S. data center development — real estate assets solely capable of operating, and powering, the new landscape of AI technology. An S&P Global study from December, first reported by CNBC, found that more than $61 billion of new investment capital flowed into the data center space in 2025, which is just ahead of the $60.8 billion that entered the space in 2024. Ratings giant Moody’s expects global investment in new data centers will reach $2.2 trillion combined in the five years preceding 2028, while U.S. Census Bureau data forecasts that data center construction spending will surpass all U.S. office building construction spending by next year. One major player, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (neé Facebook), estimated it spent between $70 billion and $72 billion in building out AI infrastructure in 2025, per third-quarter earnings. “Everything’s moving into data centers,” said Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, the global law firm. “So, what I’m telling clients is, at some point, we’re going to be oversaturated with data centers, and I don’t quite know what the exit strategy is for being in the data center space. “Having said that, I think we’re really at the infancy of that industry,” he added With money flowing this quickly, and in such large amounts, into a single commercial real estate asset class — an untraditional one, by any measure, that fuses land, utilities, power and fossil fuels, big tech, local politics and Wall Street under one big umbrella — questions are starting to emerge as to whether a bubble is forming around AI data center spending. “The projections of data center development by major tech players are truly eye-popping,” said Chris Russo, vice president of the energy practice at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. “But there’s a growing number of questions whether the projections are, in fact, real, and if the investments being made by Meta, Google, Microsoft, among others, can be justified by future revenue.” This concern about revenue and monetization lies at the heart of the data center development conundrum. For instance, OpenAI, the Silicon Valley firm that initiated the AI wave three years ago through its revolutionary ChatGPT large language model (LLM) application, is not merely one of the biggest players in the data center space. It’s an underwater one, as well. The fact is, despite the hype, OpenAI is currently generating the largest cumulative losses ever for any startup before turning a profit. A Dec. 4, 2025, study by Deutsche Bank economists found that OpenAI has revenue forecasts of $345 billion between 2024 and 2029, but it comes after $488 billion in spending on data center computer power. That means the firm will run a cash-flow of negative $143 billion. Patrick Wilson, a portfolio manager at CenterSquare Investment Management, said the largest hyperscale data center developments haven’t yet been able to monetize AI technologies, and that, at some point, capital expenditures will start to plateau if investors continue to spend like this. That would signal a risk to investors who are paying for enormous valuations without much in the way of consistent and long-term revenue streams. “At some point, by 2027 or later, the market will want to see some sort of path to monetization for a lot of this spending because the return on investment capital is so paltry, if not nonexistent,” Wilson said. “So I do start to get concerned.” Investors aren’t scared yet. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts found that publicly traded real estate companies increased investments into data centers by 15 percent last year, while research from Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, found that debt market players borrowed $100 billion for data center development in 2025. “2025 was a bit of the early stage of a gold rush, per se, with tons of new entrants, operators, capital providers and tenants,” said Andrew Kaskel, head of data centers advisory at Walker & Dunlop. “While there certainly were a lot of projects announced and funded, it’s really still the early stage of a big growth cycle.” But is it a bubble? Kaskel admitted that, sure, there’s always a chance we’ve entered into a bubble and that things will go south once interest rates rise and demand shifts, as has happened before, particularly during the 1999-2001 dot-com bubble. But this rush of data center development, and AI spending, is fundamentally different for one critical reason. “What we see, day in and day out, and across the data center space, is that the majority of the capital being allocated and invested is backed by the largest, most stable companies in the world, with the healthiest balance sheets on the planet,” said Kaskel. “It’s foundationally built upon really secure companies for the long term.” JLL research found that of the 8 gigawatts of U.S. data centers currently under construction, 73 percent is pre-leased, while vacancies are expected to remain below 5 percent into 2027, and likely hold closer to 2 percent. “Looking at the fundamentals, there is no bubble,” said Sean Farney, vice president of Americas data center strategy at JLL. “Ninety-seven percent of the existing product is utilized, we are the envy of every other industry on Earth. … So the fundamental demand for the product is there, and it’s only getting higher as supply is getting lower.” Even so, this same JLL research report concluded that data center co-location vacancy rates that sit near zero percent are “constraining economic growth and undermining national security,” and that the “restrictive market conditions are counterproductive over the long term.” So, while the money is there, questions abound and answers are few as to who wins and loses as U.S. data center development explodes — with all eyes on the uncertain path the hyperscalers might chart to monetization as the central metric of whether the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital will actually be paid back. “We’re a big believer in AI and data enters over the short term, the medium term and the long term,” said Rich Hill, global head of real estate research and strategy at Principal Asset Management. “But every single data center investor might not have a good experience.” Whole new ballgame To understand where data centers might be going, it’s important to understand what they are as an asset class, as like any piece of real estate there is nuance in the bricks and mortar. Since emerging out of the telecommunications building boom that laid the groundwork for the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, data centers have evolved today into an asset of three distinct classes. There are cloud data centers, which are used to power Americans who shop on Amazon, or search Google, or use their iPhones to save photos on an invisible cloud network. Then there are AI inference data centers, which power the large language models of ChatGPT. Finally, there are much physically larger (and prohibitively more expensive) generative AI data centers, or factories, which are a training model for future AI use — often referred to as “neocloud” — that is still unknown. Data centers within these three classes are either leased to hyperscalers, like Oracle or Meta, or are co-locations, meaning multi-tenant tenant spaces that could include up-and-coming cloud platforms like CoreWeave and Fluidstack. “There’s a lot of money going into generative AI data center development, and we view it as much more speculative, with not as much pre-leasing occurring,” said Principal’s Hill. “I’m not here to tell you if it’s good or bad, a bubble or not a bubble, but we think it’s a much better risk-adjusted return focusing on cloud and AI inference data centers.” Today there are 4,165 data centers in the U.S., an average of 83 per state. The nearest countries by count — the United Kingdom and Germany — have only 499 and 487, respectively, per Statista, a statistics website. Those numbers themselves suggest room for foreign competition on the data center front, and on AI, adding another level of uncertainty to the growth and demand in the U.S. Kristina Metzger, vice chairman at CBRE’s data center capital markets, said national core data center fundamentals are “fantastic,” with less than 2 percent vacancy, 80 percent of the development pipeline pre-leased, little to no speculative development, growing rents, and positive earnings (15 percent year-over-year), all on the back of cloud computing. But it’s the gen AI hubs that have given her pause, mainly due to questions on long-term use and overall business models. “What we’re now working through are new facets of the industry with these AI factories, and neocloud operating models, and those [business models] remain to be determined,” she said. “There isn’t the same overall story as there is in core data centers.” Dave Powell, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, specializes in data centers. He noted that there are numerous expensive questions associated with any data center development. For instance, is an end-user lined up? Is it a big tech firm or not? Will it be a hyperscale site or co-location? And, most importantly, is there a reliable source of power to make the investment pencil? “We really see that it’s all about power — electricity generation is reaching new heights … and with respect to electricity, it’s divided up by markets, and not all markets are created equal,” said Powell. “To develop a data center, you need reliable electricity, which should be relatively inexpensive, you need land, you need to be near a major metropolitan area with favorable, or non-penalizing, regulations from the local government.” Even after all these questions are answered, and the data center is finally built (in compliance with the maze of local zoning codes, of course), perhaps the biggest open-ended question is how investors will make money on an asset class whose tenants still haven’t figured out how to monetize the actual “data” propping up the multibillion-dollar “center.” “It’s a question we hear day in and day out: What is the exit and how do people ultimately get returns? And it’s still to be determined,” said Walker & Dunlop’s Kaskel. “Right now, so much of the capital is being invested on the construction and development side, and these projects are three- to five- to 10-year developments before they reach 100 percent stabilization.” Generational dollars Even amid a laundry list of uncertainties, money has poured into the space since ChatGPT came online in 2022. By 2025, even after years of Wall Street capital behind it, what pushed data centers to another level was the Trump administration’s support for the industry, primarily Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion private sector investment in the construction of 20 new data centers, collectively spanning 10 million square feet, on his first full day back in office. “We have a clear policy to support the data center builds and the recognition that data centers are part of a strategic advantage,” JLL’s Farney said of the nation at large. “[The industry] came into its own in 2025, where there was wide recognition, not just in [big tech] but in financial services, that AI is a critical component of the economy and the value-prop for every company on the face of the Earth.” The evolution of AI has come as the data center space has experienced its own metamorphosis in recent years when it comes to investment capital. Previously, data centers as an asset class were a long-term, buy-and-hold play by public real estate investment trusts (REITs), which don’t tend to sell. But the public REITs eventually realized that cash flows on data centers tended to plateau once they were leased, making them a dilutive investment for public market investors always under the gun to raise debt or equity to acquire more assets and generate quarterly returns. Cue the private equity music. The early 2020s saw Blackstone buy REIT QTS for $10 billion, American Tower purchase CoreSite for $10.1 billion, and KKR scoop up CyrusOne for $15 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the big deals continued. DigitalBridge and Silver Lake bought Vantage Data Centers, a hyperscale data center developer, in a $9.2 billion equity investment, while a consortium backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI purchased Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest deal to date. For many of these acquisitions involving the big-name hyperscalers, the money is chasing profits in the nebulous AI factory space, where many risks remain. “AI factories are quite sizable, so you’re looking at construction budgets north of $20 billion in many instances, so from an equity perspective that takeout remains to be determined, or if it’s something better suited for the public markets,” said CBRE’s Metzger. “There’s just some unknowns. None of these have delivered yet, so that process of overall monetization hasn’t taken place yet … and for some investors these might be very long-term holds.” One reason why investors have jumped so eagerly into the data center space, including the generative AI factory arena, is because of the valuations hyperscalers have experienced in the last five years, especially since AI went mainstream in 2022. Since December 2020, Google’s stock price has increased 258 percent; Microsoft’s has risen 119 percent; Meta’s 144 percent; Apple is up 105 percent; and Oracle’s stock price is 205 percent higher. “People have a general sense of a bubble, but for me it’s irrational investment behavior, and that can be both on the investment side, with capital going in, but also irrational valuations around the companies that are in there,” said CenterSquare’s Wilson. Wilson emphasized that before 2025, public REITs drove the capital into the sector. But today, with hundreds of billions of dollars required for development platforms, REITs are “incredibly small scale” compared to the private players, particularly the Big 4 Silicon Valley firms. He said Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were estimated to deploy $350 billion into the space through 2025 and are expected to invest another $511 billion in 2026. “There’s some thought it might go up, but it will get tougher and tougher to deploy starting in 2028,” he added. “A lot of the physical space will be taken up and installed, there’ll be tremendously tighter markets, and you’ll be going into the tertiary markets in North Dakota, Louisiana, west Texas, and so you do start to bump up against the level where capital expenditures plateau.” Snap, crackle and pop To even a true data center bull like JLL’s Farney, ever since Wall Street jumped into the industry in the early 2020s, the valuations for AI and data centers have been “bonkers,” but that doesn’t mean they’re dangerously priced. “Absolutely, there’s a bubble in equity pricing, along the entire value chain, but when it comes to the fundamentals of business, it’s in no way [a bubble],” he said. “No one can show me the demand is not there.” Sure, demand is all well and good, but industry experts like Chris Russo, who makes a living advising on data center economics, argue there are major, existential questions on how generative AI will be monetized. It could come in the form of all of corporate America adopting a gen AI Microsoft Co-Pilot, which is powered by ChatGPT, or life sciences firms adopting AI hyperscaler technology for research, or every white-collar business in the country automating its human workers as AI chatbots. But those remain theories, if not science fiction. “All of the investment in AI is to ultimately produce LLMs, or AI generative intelligence, but at some point people need to pay to use it as a product,” Russo said, emphasizing that revenue must appear in the flesh to justify investment. “If trillions of dollars are being committed in capital, then there needs to be trillions of dollars of capital to support it,” he added. “The money needs to come from somewhere, and where the money comes from right now is still questionable.” Right now, AI relies on a subscription model, where users pay per month. While the expectation is that large-scale corporate subscriptions will integrate these different AI technologies into their numerous businesses, the real bet is on AI getting intertwined into the everyday lives of ordinary Americans in myriad, unheard-of ways. “The hope is it gets embedded into a lot more areas of your life, and so as these things get better at image recognition, machine learning through visuals, it might integrate into wearables, and it could be embedded into autonomous vehicles diagnostics,” said Wilson. “That’s the thought, but we’re at this precipice, and, if anyone says they know where this technology is headed, call them crazy.” Another wild card in the entire narrative is the power struggle. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could account for anywhere from 5 percent to 9 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute forecasts data center electricity demand will reach 130 gigawatts by 2030, and account for 12 percent of U.S. electricity demand. And some of the numbers now being forecast are not just jaw-dropping, but in some cases fanciful. CNBC reported the Electric Reliability Council of Texas projects 220 gigawatts of large data center developments have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030. Mike Hogan, senior adviser to Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit think tank that advises on energy policy, noted that 225 gigawatts of new data center demand in Texas is almost six times the current peak load of the whole state, which is projected to be 40 gigawatts by 2030, and that the U.S. power grid is 900 gigawatts total. “It’s very, very difficult to imagine that all of that development is for real,” said Hogan, who noted many data center development contracts counted are duplicative across states, or speculative. “I’m far from alone in thinking that we’re in the middle of a bubble. But it’s also true that if only 10 percent of that comes through, it’s a significant amount of new load.” Russo, another skeptic, noted that, right now, data center developers are “almost indifferent to what energy costs,” because returns are currently so high, while the average American voter might not be so amenable to increased energy bills due to the wave of new data center deals. “Data centers are making clear one of the fundamental principles of markets: When something is scarce, it becomes expensive, and, at the moment, there is a very large demand for electricity from data centers and consumers, and that increases prices,” he said. “Everyone loves market incentives, but nobody likes the side effects of higher bills.” Even if the access to power for data center developers has immediate solutions — JLL’s Farney noted that large consumers are creating their own multistate natural gas arrangements, while also investing heavily into alternatives to existing grid technology via nuclear power, coal and solar — there is still the threat inherent in the technology itself. Unlike railroad infrastructure or telecommunication fiber optic cables, the chips built today that power data centers won’t be useful in five years, let alone 100 years, according to Russo. “The speed at which this technology depreciates — and a lot of the value is consumed very quickly — is astonishing compared to other industries,” he said. “It’s like developing an office building and replacing the plumbing and wiring almost immediately.” CenterSquare’s Wilson said the bubble threat to the market isn’t so much like the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but more like the boom-and-bust cycle that occurred during the growth of the railroad industry in the 19th century. “I do think this is a huge inflection point in society going forward,” he said. “This isn’t a fad, but there will be, like there always is in bubbles, if we can call this a bubble, wreckage, and there will be losers.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Share this article Bank of America’s wealth advisers will be permitted to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to their clients starting today. Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance last month that the bank would officially kick off coverage for four Bitcoin ETFs, including Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), on January 5. The bank endorses a 1%–4% allocation to digital assets for clients across Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge. With this move, Bank of America is joining Morgan Stanley in expanding access to digital asset investment products for its clients. The move is viewed as a meaningful change from the bank’s former conservative position on digital assets. Greater availability of Bitcoin ETFs through major financial institutions could draw new investors into the market and potentially boost overall demand. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Ethereum has long talked a big game. Now it’s time for the second biggest blockchain to deliver
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2026/01/05/ethereum-2026-vitalik-buterin-fork-in-the-road/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T12:36:31Z
Full Content:
On Jan. 1, Vitalik Buterin announced a New Year’s resolution for the blockchain he devised way back in 2013. It’s time, he declared, for Ethereum to step up and deliver on its original mission: “To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” Buterin’s message is a timely one. For more than a decade now, Ethereum has offered the tantalizing promise of a global computer, available to anyone, that can be used to create decentralized alternatives to Big Tech’s data-gobbling monopolies. The blockchain popularized smart contracts, and has been a springboard for thousands of projects backed by billions of dollars. It has also spawned legions of mostly fly-by-night imitators. Despite all of this, the promise of Ethereum always seems just over the horizon. In recent years, the blockchain has come to resemble that can’t-miss sports prospect who can’t quite hack it in the big leagues. Instead of evolving into a popular global computer, Ethereum still feels like a sub-culture where cliques of insiders build esoteric applications for each other. In response, many in the crypto world started betting on other horses like Solana that promised to deliver practical results. Ethereum’s problem, ironically, has been its idealism. The blockchain has a core community that believes passionately in decentralization, and is mistrustful of anything resembling formal authority. That includes Buterin, who stepped back from his creation several years ago, preferring to let Ethereum find its own path forward. All of this is admirable, especially in contrast to many recent arrivals on the crypto scene, whose first and only concern is to make a buck. Unfortunately, it has also led Ethereum developers to dither in the face of obvious problems, including congestion and high gas fees. To be fair, the blockchain has made some important fixes—but only after allowing piggy-back chains, known as layer 2s, to siphon off large amounts of revenue and make the crypto landscape painfully complicated. Now, though, change could be in the air. In the last two years, both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase have launched tokenized assets that settle directly to the main Ethereum blockchain. This is a testament to how Ethereum remains the gold standard for security and points to a future where it will be the backbone of global finance. The tokenized transactions also legitimize Ethereum’s claim to be a universal computer, and could spur the mainstream adoption of other decentralized applications for social media, identity, and more. For this to happen, though, the Ethereum community will require Buterin’s ongoing leadership. That’s why his New Year’s Day post is a welcome development. The piece reinforced the primacy of decentralization as Ethereum’s paramount value: “We’re building decentralized applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running even if the original developers disappear.” But it also delivered a pragmatic piece of advice to the community seeking to build this decentralized future: Get on with it, already. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Trump airdrop coming: Yet another Trump token is on the way as Truth Social announced an upcoming drop to its shareholders via Crypto.com. The company added the token will not be transferable and “cannot be exchanged for cash” but could become redeemable for Trump Media discounts.

(WSJ) Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the multi-billion dollar Bitfinex hack, is the latest crypto criminal to walk free. He now faces a fate many would regard as worse than prison—resuming domestic life with his rapper wife Razzlekhan. It was once fashionable for journalists to seize on price slumps in order to write sneering columns predicting Bitcoin’s demise. These “Bitcoin obituaries” persisted well after the currency’s viability became clear, but now appear to have finally faded altogether.

Title: Even the Wall Street Journal Doubts the Trump Seize-Venezuela-Oil Scheme

Alert readers immediately noticed the disconnect between Trump’s signature braggadocio and the more cautious remarks from the other members of Trump’s team after the kidnapping of Venezuela’s president Nicholas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Trump skipped the narco-terrorism pretext despite a US indictment being the pretext for the abduction; he instead talked up having US companies exploit Venezuela’s reserves: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.” But many observers quickly compared the Trump press conference to Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” moment as the Venezuela government not only remains in place but its acting president Delcy Rodriguez maintains that Maduro remains the country’s leader and that Venezuela will not cede to US colonialist demands. And perhaps being a smidge more realistic, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, by contrast, presented the US as having narrower aims, of simply removing Maduro, at the initial presser, and has been trying to square the circle of Trump being high on his show of force versus the fact that the US is not even remotely in control of Venezuela. From Politico: In the wake of the U.S.’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday made it clear that it is somewhat unclear what’s next for the Latin American country. His comments come as Democratic leaders continue to decry the administration’s actions in Venezuela and push for the White House to seek congressional approval for such military operations. In multiple interviews, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela but stopped short of explaining exactly what the U.S. role in the country will look like as both nations reel from Maduro’s arrest — and in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s statement Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela for an indeterminate time. “We are at war against drug trafficking organizations, not at war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Rubio added that oil sanctions will remain in place, and the U.S. reserves the right to issue strikes against alleged drug boats heading toward America. But while Rubio told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the U.S. is not occupying Venezuela, he did not reject the idea that it could be a future option from the Trump administration. Trump, Rubio said, “does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that’s not what you’re seeing right now.” “What you’re seeing right now is a quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,” he added. Many experts with knowledge of the region, such as Larry Johnson, have given repeated, long-form accounts of how much harder it would be to conquer Venezuela that Iraq, even before factoring in that our army is much smaller and weaker now than then. A short version of this line of argument from Modern War Monitor: Venezuela is heavily armed. Years of political polarization, along with an expanded role for security forces and pro-government colectivos, mean that weapons and combat experience are not in short supply. The country’s borders are long, porous and already used by guerrillas, paramilitaries, and criminal networks. To see what that might look like in practice, you don’t have to speculate; you can look next door. Colombia’s armed conflict, officially dating from 1964, pitted the state against FARC, ELN, and a web of paramilitary and criminal actors for decades. It persisted, in part, because armed groups could slip across borders, find safe havens, move contraband, and restock. Even with massive US funding under Plan Colombia and repeated “final” offensives, the state never achieved a clean victory; violence simply changed shape. Translate that pattern into a post-Maduro Venezuela run in practice by US–backed figures, and you can sketch the basic dynamic. There will be bombings of police stations and government offices, high-profile assassinations, and attacks on oil infrastructure. Kidnapping Americans or US contractors will become a lucrative tactic. Armed groups will drift across the Colombian and Brazilian borders and into the jungle or mountains when pressure grows. Even Sky News is reporting that men and women on the street are speaking out on behalf of the current regime: 🗣️ "The US is not interested in freedom or democracy, it is interested in our oil." Venezuelans gathered in Caracas to express their solidarity with Nicolas Maduro, who was captured by the United States following a series of airstrikes. Latest updates: https://t.co/4w875fZU8W pic.twitter.com/b5byRmj15m — Sky News (@SkyNews) January 4, 2026 So oil theater is signature Trump, of acting like empty bags have value. He talked up his “raw earths” deal with Zelensky, which still proved to be a difficult negotiation even with the US theoretically holding all the card by providing Ukraine with critical intel and targeting along with weapons, particularly air defenses. And that’s before getting to the fact that as of when the agreement was inked, over one-half of the “Ukraine” reserves were in Russian hands, and how much of Ukraine eventually winds up being formally part of Russia and/or in a rump Ukraine that is a Russian vassal is up in the air. Similarly, in the 28 to 20 point piece plan floating about, Trump’s negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner claim that one of two really key US demands involves joint ownership of the Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant and the disposition of its energy. This idea is delusional. Russia deems Zaprozhizhia to be part of Russia and is not going to hand part of the nuclear facility to the US to make nice to Trump. We’ve already discussed that wringing more production out of Venezuela’s oil fields would require a long period of investment before any real payoff took place. And the precedent of Iraq, where we had occupied the country, bodes ill. Despite oil being seen as the most logical objective for the US invasion, it was years before oil producers started investing. Admittedly, the embargo is increasing pressure on the Venezuela government. Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA is cutting crude production because it is running out of storage capacity due to an ongoing US oil blockade that has halted exports, increasing pressure on the interim government https://t.co/eAelegFxHM pic.twitter.com/sIs9UqaQei — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) January 5, 2026 So why not stick with Plan A? Was this yet another manifestation of Trump’s extreme need to be seen as dominating world events? To create a distraction from the Epstein files and increasing certainty that Russia will secure a military victory in Ukraine, which will mean Trump lost? IMHO the initial apparent success of the Trump “Raid not invade” in Caracas almost assures that he will take Greenland when Ukraine is clearly toast. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media is raising eyebrows over Trump’s grandiose oil exploitation claims. It is true that the US has motive, in that our refineries are tuned so that 70% of the oil they process is heavier grades, despite the US producing light sweet crudes.1 And commentators have pointed out that after the US sanctioned Russia, cutting it off from its medium heavy crude. Even though Russian supplies purportedly represented only 3% of US imports and experts predicted that its loss would matter little to the US, Biden turned to Venezuela almost immediately after imposing the shock and awe sanctions, explicitly to replace Russian fuel. However, heavy and sour (as in sulfur-ridden) crude of the Venezuela sort is expensive to process. The current low oil price environment, driven by less-than-robust growth in much of the world,2 is an unfavorable backdrop, even before getting to perfectly reasonable big corporate concerns about safety and expropriation risk. Do not be fooled by Trump likely succeeding in having a flurry of meetings with big oil execs. There was also a lot of dog-and-pony showing for a Ukraine reconstruction fund, starting under Biden, that continued with Trump. Many misread the involvement of giant fund manager BlackRock, which had signed up only as an adviser and had not committed any money. We featured an OilPrice article in late 2025 that argued that it didn’t make economic sense for the US to try to seize Venezuela’s oil. First from our long intro: This article explains why Venezuela’s oil is not of much strategic value to the US and its infrastructure would take a lot of investment over a long time to bring up to snuff. Yet Trump has shifted his justification from narco-terrorism to, erm, retaking the oil and other assets, in going to war with Venezuela (recall a blockade is an act of war)… Recall that after the weapons of mass destruction justification for the Iraq war fell apart, the Administration then provided a series of pretexts, even as most observers argued that the oil was the reason. Iraq then had the world’s second largest proven reserves, and they were highly prized light sweet crude. And while the US still has substantial control over Iraq’s oil exports, the US were slow to invest in Iraq’s oil infrastructure. I cannot find the source, but I recall reading that the majors were not comfortable the US level of exploitation of the Iraqi resource…. A 2012 Aljazeera story intimated that the Western firms, even though they won the critical oil concessions after the war, had not done as well as they had hoped, confirming the idea that the exploitation of the Iraq resource was not handled in an expeditious manner…. But my impression is that the later theories, that Iraq was a stepping stone on the way to subjugating Iran, and the oil was at most a secondary objective, are on target. From the OilPrice article proper: The Wall Street Journal story flagged in our headline comes to similar conclusions. From Trump Wants to Unlock Venezuela’s Oil Reserves. A Huge Challenge Awaits: The Trump administration’s move to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro…. will pave the way for U.S. oil companies to regain a foothold in the South American nation, President Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago press conference. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said. But getting foreign companies to flock back to Venezuela will be a massive challenge. Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company there…. Other oil executives will be forced to gauge the stability on the ground in a country where the industry has fallen into disarray… The other obstacle facing Trump’s effort to put more of Venezuela’s viscous crude into the global market is that the world doesn’t have much of an appetite for more oil… The U.S. hasn’t detailed the mechanics of how it would bring more American oil companies into Venezuela to boost production. Analysts say it could facilitate a process that would allow companies to bid for oil and gas blocks and question whether European companies could also bid for the right to enter the country. As readers know, that assumes subjugation of Venezuela or cooperation that has yet to be in evidence. The article cited a statement by Chevron being “focused” on employee safety and “integrity” of its Venezuela operation. Not hard to read that as an expression of heightened concern. In passing, it also signaled doubt about whether the level of Venezuelan reserves are as large as claimed (supposedly the largest in the world). This is not crazy. Matthew Simmons of Peak Oil fame produced tables showing OPEC members posting sudden increases in claimed reserves, which he documented had no substantiation (as in no new discoveries or changes in production methods that could lead to bigger supplies from existing assets). He argued a big reason for these rises was that OPEC set production levels among its members based on their proven reserves. Back to the Journal: In the U.S., the shale boom unleashed record levels of oil production, but the kind of oil American frackers are pumping doesn’t work as well as heavy crude produced in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico. Venezuela’s government says its proved oil reserves top 300 billion barrels, which, if true, would make its bounty the world’s largest. Other big oil companies that are potentially interested in re-entering Venezuela will almost certainly take time to evaluate the situation because the country has a track record of appropriating oil assets, as it did in the 1970s and the 2000s, analysts said. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil pulled out of Venezuela in 2007 after then-President Hugo Chávez nationalized their assets. Conoco later sued the Venezuelan government for more than $20 billion; Exxon sued for $12 billion. The companies were awarded fractions of their losses in protracted arbitration proceedings… Orlando Ochoa, a Caracas-based economist and a visiting fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described the Herculean task of jump-starting the moribund energy industry, which has seen tens of thousands of trained professionals flee the country under Maduro’s authoritarian rule. He said that includes drafting a broad economic stabilization plan to attract the financing Venezuela badly needs from multilateral lenders to rebuild infrastructure and rusted oil-field installations. Local laws need to be modified to allow private energy firms to operate without state overreach, he added. And the government has to restructure some $160 billion in debt and settle pending arbitration cases with foreign companies to convince them to come back. “What the U.S. needs to do is to implement a form of a Marshall Plan,” said Ochoa, referring to the economic program that helped rebuild Europe after World War II. “This is about much more than coming into the oil and gas sector just to extract crude from the ground.” Good luck with that. This is from a bunch that is so seat-of-the-pants that it can’t even conduct negotiations with Russia on a disciplined basis. Reuters echoes the Journal’s concerns: Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Its struggles with electricity production have repeatedly hampered mining and oil operations. The country was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day of crude in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output. Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged some 1.1 million bpd last year or just 1% of global production. That’s roughly the same production as the U.S. state of North Dakota. “If developments ultimately lead to a genuine regime change, this could even result in more oil on the market over time. However, it will take time for production to recover fully,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen from Global Risk Management… “History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. Reuters usefully presents 2019 and 2021 data from Venezuela on gold, coal and nickel reserves. It also includes this interesting factoid: Venezuela owes about $10 billion to China after China became the largest lender under late President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela repays loans with crude transported in three very large crude carriers previously co-owned by Venezuela and China. But Reuters oddly does not mention the large gas field off the coast of Venezuela and Guyana, which relates to a long-standing territorial dispute.3 Finally from the New York Times: The national oil company, known as PDVSA, lacks the capital and expertise to increase production. The country’s oil fields are run down and suffer from “years of insufficient drilling, dilapidated infrastructure, frequent power cuts and equipment theft,” according to a recent study by Energy Aspects, a research firm. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, which is now exported primarily to China….. In theory, if U.S. oil companies were given greater access in Venezuela, they could help gradually turn the industry around. “But it’s not going to be a straightforward proposition,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects. Analysts say increasing Venezuelan production will not be cheap. Energy Aspects estimated that adding another half a million barrels a day of production would cost $10 billion and take about two years. Major increases might require “tens of billions of dollars over multiple years,” the firm said. Some experts are throwing even more cold water on the Trump hoped-for oil heist. Be sure to click through. The analysis is detailed and devastating. I have spent a lot of time talking shit at people with opinions on Venezuela's oil production potential, and how it's going to "RePLaCe CanADa". So here's my contribution — how I see the cost of replacing Canadian crude with Venezuelan heavy. I think it's a nearly $1 trillion… pic.twitter.com/XFlPVwPdew — Michael Spyker (@ShaleTier7) January 4, 2026 To entice you to read the whole tweet, one paragraph from the middle: The problem is they don’t have the power infrastructure to add the power needed for 3MMBbls/d of SAGD for steam generation, and even for primary recovery they don’t have the electricity they need. So you need to build 10-15 GW of new power infra, at gas-fired capital cost including transmission and the new midstream infra to move gas (including LNG import terminals), that’s another $40-75Bn just to get the power to the SAGD facilities. There are constant rolling blackouts in the country. You also need ~7-900MB/d of diluent looping on the Venezuela side, including DRUs for another ~$25Bn. Other local midstream refurb is at least $15Bn to replace ashphalted and corroded trunk lines. Any North American firm would also have to commit to cleaning up Lake Maracaibo which is a $10Bn commitment. So this Trump romp in South America is sure to end badly. The big open question is whether Trump decides to break more china there or goes TACO and moves to other, seemingly easier, targets. ____ 1 Thanks to the state of search, I have been unable to find estimates of how much it would cost to retune a refinery to process lighter grades, although I infer that newer refineries make this possible at lower cost than for older ones. Per the American Fuel & Petroleum Manufacturers website : Long before the U.S. shale boom, when global production of light sweet crude oil was declining, we made significant investments in our refineries to process heavier, high-sulfur crude oils that were more widely available in the global market. These investments were made to ensure U.S. refineries would have access to the feedstocks needed to produce gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Heavier crude is now an essential feedstock for many U.S. refineries. Substituting it for U.S. light sweet crude oil would make these facilities less efficient and competitive, leading to a decline in fuel production and higher costs for consumers. 2 Trump tariffs and Chinese overinvestment and resulting deflation are big drivers. Neither looks set to change soon. 3 Among other things, Venezuela has credibly alleged that the long-ago arbitrator was bribed. I am skipping over this topic for now, but those interested, please see The Guyana-Venezuela dispute and UK involvement and Guyana’s Oil Wealth Drives Tensions With Venezuela. So one view is that the subjugation of Venezuela would also solve the Venezuela dispute with Guyana and facilitate development there. This is reminiscent of Peter Cook’s World Domination League,,where you would knock on the door and politely ask to be allowed to dominate people. Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head. Not that I don’t think the fix is in but it can’t be done on the cheap like they are trying. power peeps care not one whit about doing things on the cheap. Budgets and spending are matters of Political Will, and Political Won’t. There will always be plenty of money to procure arms, siphon dough off to the MIC, to protect Oil resources that the US assumes and asserts are ‘hers’. Same Old Sh*t, different Emperial action. I guess with Trump, it is Imperial? I hope that Dulci and the Chavista movement stay strong in Venezuela but I’m uneasy about her 1-hour reported call with Narco Rubio and the fact there was no military opposition to the raid. I also hope that Trump takes Greenland next. It will be delicious to see the craven EU twist itself into a pretzel to not sanction the US in anyway despite the latter waging a war against it. It will expose it to those who still don’t see how useless it is. The handover from Rafael Correa to Lenin Moreno in Ecuador constitutes a sobering precedent: from a leftist government that implemented quite a number of reforms favouring the working class, sovereignty in the exploitation of resources, and autonomy from the USA to one doing a 180-turn (Baerbock-360) that privatized everything, abolished social reforms, exited ALBA, accepted the yoke of the IMF, and started a steady cooperation with the USA. The former basis of Correa protested heavily, and was crushed. Moreno had been vice-president of Correa, and was member of the same party — just like Delcy Rodriguez wrt. Nicolas Maduro. The Defense Minister’s house was bombed and he is alive only by virtue of having gotten to a shelter. At least two of the ~10 helicopters were hit, which means shot at, and some soliders were injured as a result but I infer not badly. The US sent in over 150 planes. From Task & Purpose: The force included a mix of Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps bombers, fighter jets and electronic attack planes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Saturday. Speaking at a press conference with President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Caine said that the force used included “F-22s, F, 35s, F-18s, EA18s, E-2s B-1, bombers and other support aircraft, as well as numerous remotely piloted drones.” The various aircraft hit several targets in Venezuela, including the La Guaira port, the military headquarters complex at Fort Tiuna in Caracas and multiple airports. While the jets and bombers flew overhead and prepared for any aerial response, helicopters flown by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment entered, carrying members of Delta Force. They flew over a largely blacked out Caracas, which Trump implied was as a result of operations by American forces. Caine noted that U.S. Cyber Command and Space Command carried out actions in support of the air assault. https://taskandpurpose.com/news/fighters-bombers-venezuela-attack-maduro/ And Vanessa Beeley speculated: Were the alleged 5000 Russian-manufactured Manpad systems jammed, as happened in Iran during the first 24 hours of the Zionist aggression in June 2025? https://beeley.substack.com/p/14-points-on-trump-kidnap-of-venezuelan? Listened to a few podcasts this morning and it was either Alastair Cook or Chas Freeman or both who said that 30 Cuban soldiers who comprised Maduro’s personal bodyguard were all killed. Yesterday there was that report from the Russian pundit (Korbyko?) who claimed Russian forces went in to protect Maduro and were fired on by his bodyguard – that claim seems a little odd to me. All that seems certain at this point was that there was some resistance to his capture. thank you. I watched Max and Anya’s livestream about this yesterday and they didn’t have these details yet. And from today’s links, I learned that a military base repelled an attack as well so there was some resistance. Very clean operation by the US. It seems very likely the CIA did pay for a lot of intel and perhaps some cooperation. But IMHO there is a tendency to over-rely on that idea as being the main driver here due to: 1. Bias to see Latinos as corrupt 2. Bias to see US military as not very good (when our special ops are pretty good). And remember, Mossad likely helped a lot. 3. Psyops playing up idea of top level cooperation to weaken Rodriguez and incumbents (keep pressure on them) and make US operation look less illegitimate at the margin (ie, locals cooperated in the raid). Greenland will be much easier: 1. Declare Greenland US territory 2. Send ICE in to round-up and deport the non-US citizens to willing Sub-Saharan hosts There’s less than 60,000 of soon-to-be illegals in Greenland– Homeland Security can clean house in a week. Wouldn’t this be the end of NATO? (I wouldn’t cry for this) Urup would finally have to face up to its submerging reality and cut its increasingly threadbare cloth accordingly. South America could not supply enough coke to cope. How does Trump even TACO from this mess? Release Maduro? I guess he could hold Maduro in legal limbo a la Assange for years/decades. A la Assange, a la Epstein, a la Milosevic, a la Hussein, a la carte. There’s a lot on the menu. Hei, wouldn’t it be something if they Epsteined him?!? Hear the shrieks get even louder! Perhaps the U.S. has learned from previous mistakes (Iraq, Libya) and realized that destroying an existing regime is not a good idea. The oil industry requires long-term investments, which depend on stability. The process I am seeing reminds me of the “Transition” in Spain in 1978. In a smooth “Transition,” the current elites retain most of their power in exchange for: 1) providing stability, 2) accommodating U.S. interests, and 3) eventually moving to the background. If the Spanish “Transition” is the template, we should see elections within 1-2 years, with the winner being a “centrist” candidate. Someone clarify: When in the last 60 years has the US learned from a mistake, whether or not that mistake was admitted? I’m not coming up with a single one, except for multiple examples of the learning part being “keep it even more secret”. They’ve lerned to stop the draft after the Vietnam War, and feed their grinder with foreign meat. That’s what kept them going. “Words calculated to catch everyone may catch no one.” “The sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions. But there is also, it seems to me, a moment at which democracy must prove its capacity to act. Every man has a right to be heard; but no man has the right to strangle democracy with a single set of vocal cords.” Adlai Stevenson Trump’s goal is not to seize oil. Rather, he wants to avenge his humiliating loss in Ukraine by defeating Russia’s key allies, such as Syria and Venezuela. Perhaps you’re right. But according to Mercouris at least, Russia is doing surprisingly well in Syria under the new regime, and this strike against Venezuela is most likely to result in the Russia/China relationship getting even stronger as China might look to Russia for even more oil… https://youtu.be/5CrOrDheZ9s?si=yf3LZJyEGuJLDbjf Perhaps Trump has achieved a key goal in cutting off a Petro supply line to China? May be insignificant in the number of tankers going through Panana but will be seen as a win by Trump to attempt restricting Chinese economic growth. *Sigh* Please consider uinsg a search engine, as I just did: Trump suggested on Saturday that China will continue to receive some Venezuelan oil under a U.S.-led government in Caracas, but that amount is likely to be limited. https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-refiners-win-chinese-rivals-lose-trumps-venezuela-strike-2026-01-04/ * The US’s intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, as China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country. * Venezuelan shipments provide a unique type of crude used to produce bitumen, which is vital for construction and road building, and is also deeply discounted, making it popular with China’s independent refiners. * A hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months, with almost 82 million barrels currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia. The US’s shock intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, although the short-term impact will be softened by large volumes of sanctioned crude being stored at sea. China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country, but that trade now looks in jeopardy after the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. President Donald Trump said the US would run the country and American companies would rebuild its oil industry and sell a “large amount” to global buyers, including current customers and new ones, without specifically mentioning China. https://archive.is/gRk9D#selection-1611.0-1647.341 Russia can provide China with heavy crude (Urals is medium heavy), increasing Chinese dependence on Russia, but filling any bitumen gap would take some doing. From an article explaining why Russia’s bitumen exports had fallen: Russia’s strategic reorientation of oil-product sales toward Asia—especially China and South Asia—complicated logistical flows for bitumen specifically. Unlike crude oil and gasoil, bitumen is not easily rerouted through long-distance maritime transport without special heating systems, viscosity management, and insulated storage. Some of Russia’s older export terminals on the Baltic Sea and Black Sea lacked the upgraded heating and pumping infrastructure required for large-scale redirection. As a result, even if the intention existed to replace European markets with Asian importers, the operational and technical constraints reduced Russia’s ability to shift bitumen exports efficiently. https://bitumenmag.com/News/global-repercussions-of-russias-declining-bitumen-output-in-2025 Thanks Yves, first time contributor so learning the ropes. Will get better. Sorry to have seemed rough on you and appreciate you being a good sport. While 80-90% of Venezuela’s crude oil export goes to China in recent years, only 4% of China’s crude import comes from Venezuela according to a recent report from Reuters. China is probably more worried about the debt it lent to Venezuela. And China can buy heavy crude from Canada… Willy OAM, over at his YouTube channel (Legends) mentioned on his video yesterday that lots of liars are using statistics to distort the dependence of China on Venezuelan oil. Apparently, only 4% of China’s oil comes from Venezuela. So, they should be able to easily replace that even if Trump succeeds in blocking oil exports. I was half listening to Trump waffle on about taking Venezuela’s oil when he used a word that I had not heard him using before in talking about that oil and I think that it was the word recompense. He was saying that he would take the oil and profits would be used to help the Venezuelan people. That was what the government has been doing and I am sure that he only means certain parts of the population. Regardless, he slipped that word recompense in and what I think that he means is this. He will take that oil, sell it, deduct what the US has had to pay for this to happen (I would imagine that would also include the tens of billions of dollars spent on the blockade) and then they would take out recompense. By that I am sure that he means the decades worth of lost profits that the US never made on that oil so in the end, there will be very little left for the common people. This plus the Michael Spyker thread prompts ”socialize the costs, privatize the profits”-dictum How many and which billionaires do you need to off in order to stop this evil? Sounds like trickle-down economics, with high viscosity fluid. :) https://www.upworthy.com/pitch-drop-experiment-still-fascinates After Saturday’s presser, with Trump talking about oil and identifying the colonial viceroys standing behind him while the others talked only of narco-gang-poison-crime and getting the kingpin in SDNY, I was thinking about my remark when we were discussing this Oil Price (quoted again above) that it might still be about the oil for Trump. I had opined that perhaps Trump doesn’t understand the obstacles, like he doesn’t understand about the effects of tariffs, and there may be neocons that find it useful for him to believe the oil story. Now Yves added a very interesting dimension to this: he’s doing sales theater like with the Ukraine minerals. Trump the real estate developer has a long career of talking up things that don’t exist trying to raise the investment needed to make them, many of the things being completely pie-in-the-sky, and that’d often be fitting in projects’ early stages (compare selling Venezuelan oil production licenses to selling Theranos equity). With all that experience Trump may find it reflexive and/or natural-feeling to talk up the oil like he did. Ultimately, the real motives for this whole Venezuelan adventure are most likely the usual 1) empire, in this case establishing the Donroe Doctrine (which the CW seems to accept, judging from early reactions), and 2) he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. The usual, indeed. And there is no such thing as narco-terrorism. Adults willing to go on camera and say narco-terrorism out loud or claim “we are at war withbdrig traffickers” are so obviously lying. With this administration, don’t they even have a truth to hide? Trump is a 1980s Reagan guy living in a 21st century world and that applies to much of the Repub party that supports him. Meanwhile the Dems try to coast on their own brand fumes. The only thing new in our not so brave new world is the rise of the computer industry and they too live in an imaginary bubble. I’ve been rewatching old episodes of the Mike Judge absurdist comedy Silicon Valley. The characters are all deeply weird comic types and it’s hilarious. He satirizes the way these nerds talk about “making the world a better place” when it’s really all about money even if the central character–the nerdiest of all–does seem sincere. Trump apes all that “better place” lingo but nobody could possibly buy his pitch unless they are feeling trapped by TINA. When that last collapses maybe things will finally change. …he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. Doing an imperialist takeover of some foreign country is not a good way to distract the population from your failures. Recent decades have given us plenty of examples of how these operations inevitably play out, which is more gigantic failures and usually the signature catastrophe of your administration. When you think of Lyndon Johnson, what do you think of? Vietnam! When you think of Ronald Reagan, what do you think of? Iran-Contra! When you think of Bill Clinton, what do you think of? Iraq (part 1)! When you think of GW bush, what do you think of? Afghanistan and Iraq (part 2). When you think of Obama, what do you think of? Iraq and Afghanistan! When you think of Biden, what do you think of? Ukraine and Afghanistan! I will leave it as an exercise to the reader regarding what Trump’s historic legacy will be. Bushco will always be remembered as the sawdust head Charlie McCarthy to Edgar Bergen Cheney. It’s a long time between now and November, and today’s “win” could well turn into a significant political loss – particularly if Trump régime follows it up with Iran, or the Russians start deliberately taking out Americans in the Ukraine, or the Taiwanese decide that China has prepared an offer they can’t refuse, or that he makes a move on Greenland and steps on Russian and Chinese toes. Great analysis, as usual, Yves. Especially in this, err, overly dynamic situation. I’m curious about your views on the point Larry Johnson made recently that this is a step towards the US guaranteeing it’s supply of oil in the face of potential oil market upheavals if Israel (+US) attack Iran? This could be simply getting a few pieces on the board in advance of a longer Iran play… What do you think? its really reallty really worthwhile to read the Stryker X thread: https://x.com/ShaleTier7/status/2007936384448024898 which assumes no resistance (in the new age of drones, where China and Russia have incentive to bog the US down in a new Vietnam). There also is an assumption that China will provide the necessary rare earths and components to allow the US to retool the Venezuelan oil industry to prevent it from exporting oil to China! If that is Johnson’s argument, I don’t understand it. Venezuela supplies to global markets are too small to have any impact on a closure-of-the-Strait-of-Hormuz scenario. Thanks. From this article https://larrycjohnson.substack.com/p/is-the-maduro-kidnapping-a-prelude Larry says I believe the true objective of the kidnapping operation to remove Maduro is to secure US control of Venezuelan oil in anticipation of a disruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf when Israel, with US-backing, launches a new attack on Iran Although having read through the long tweet by ShaleTier7 and the arguments you make above, I am also persuaded that if this *was* their thinking they have sorely miscalculated. What a shock. Cheers It may be that Larry Johnson assumes a lack of knowledge alongside frail intellectual abilities are the guiding stars of US policy. Or it could be that Trump is going to re-make all the roads in the US, re-build all the bridges and develop wonderful housing estates for the poor and generally make every white Amercan life great again. What a guy! Thank you for this excellent analysis. “Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head.” I am curious what the cost of the whole Venezuela project has been to ‘arrest’ Maduro. The Pricer says around $60 million. https://www.thepricer.org/how-much-did-the-u-s-spend-to-capture-maduro/ That seems very low to me. Navy ships have continuous overhead, but I believe being on station must be more expensive. And then there is the strikes on the narco-terrorist boats, the DEA, the Coast Guard involvement. A lot of money for nothing in my book. Same with the money spent ‘getting’ all the terrorists we have chased for 25 years. I guess the payoff must be the resulting militaristic rule in the USA. That Pricer article attempted to define the incremental costs of the op. It states a major uncertainty is the ordnance expended. It doesn’t attempt to cost out the general presence mission cost. Keep in mind we have had an ongoing level of effort counter-drug op in the Caribbean for about as long as I’ve been around. Of course we have gone from a board-and-arrest model to attack-and-destroy. That’s separate from the cost of enforcing sanctions. Trump is obviously high on his supposed perfect military abduction. Unfortunately, when his oil heist doesn’t go as planned, and it won’t, Trump will probably get uglier toward the Venezuelan people. Trump basically sounds like a mob boss when he said if the new president Delcy Rodriguez “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Trump, according to the NYT, told reporters, “And don’t ask me who’s in charge, because I’ll give you an answer, and it’ll be very controversial.” “What does that mean?” a reporter asked. “It means we’re in charge,” the president said. One might think of the Nazis and the annexation of Austria. Hitler visited Austria to meet with Austrian Nazis. This was Hitler’s home country. He spent time visiting his family home and the border crossing where his father worked. It seemed he cared about Austrians. It didn’t work out well for Austrians or the Austrian Nazis who thought they were more or less partners. The Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was arrested and spent the war in a concentration camp. Austrian ministers were replaced when Hitler sent his own ministers to Vienna to run the country. Austrian Nazis had little or no power. The Austrian Central bank was looted for its gold and foreign reserves. Austria’s iron ore deposits were seized immediately, as well as other mineral resources, oil, art works, etc. I hope the Venezuelans realize what Trump has in store for them. Looks like the interm president got the message: Venezuelan interim leader tones down criticism, ready to ‘work with the US’ Acting President Delcy Rodriguez calls for a ‘balanced and respectful’ relationship with Washington during transition. “We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed towards shared development,” she continued. The US does have Venezuela over the barrel, quite literally. A bit of lip-service at this point can be a step towards reducing the immediate heat without being tantamount to capitulation or surrender– pull a Ukraine: sign a few agreements, buy some time to more properly arm. I don’t see how Venezuela can break out of the stranglehold that the US has it in. As economic conditions there worsen, the US remains out of reach, and civil unrest will turn inward to find targets close at hand. The issue is not the regime change threat. It’s the blockade, But it costs the US to keep that going. And someone in Russia might have clued Rodriguez in that it costs nothing to talk nicely to Trump, and he gets off on that. Except Trump takes the soft soap seriously and wants revenge when he finds out it isn’t. Crooke suggests the Russians may be changing their tactics and withdrawing from Trump engagement. IMHO everyone important in Russia except Putin and Dmitriev,, who has his stature elevated by this charade, has been wanting to withdraw from Trump engagement. Putin needed to go along, regardless of what he felt (and he really does not like war, I think he is natively very conservative on that front) to placate his Global South economic allies, particularly China and India. But in an important late-in-year Q&A (not his big year-end event but not long before that) Putin said it suited Russia better to resolve Project Ukraine on the battlefield. It still costs Russia nothing to play along. But Putin is likely to decline further in-person engagement with anyone other than Trump or perhaps Rubio. They probably can’t break out of it until enough other nations realize that they can either hang together now or hang separately later. How many countries does the US need to destroy before other nations fight back? You would think that at the very least, the UN could impose massive sanctions on the US. Yes, I know, I did laugh a little as I typed that last sentence. The UN is about as useless as the US Congress Aboard AF1, Trump told a reporter, “We need total access in Venezuela. We need access to the oil and to other things.” “Total Access” Trump also accused Venezuela of stealing from the US. He said, “It was the greatest theft in the history of America. Nobody has ever stolen our property like they have. They took our oil away from us.” I can’t find an accurate figure but it seems Venezuela has roughly $5 billion in gold at its central bank and another $2 billion in the UK which the UK has refused to return. There are other valuable minerals available to be extracted. And, of course, lots of water front property. I can imagine Trump stealing what he can as payback while waiting for the oil business to recover. https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-he-wants-total-access-from-venezuela-comments-on-cubans-killed-c08d04e0f1d7467e87fdb3f66c3eac77 https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/05/business/oil-venezuela-trump The Iraq tragedy is being repeated as farce in Venezuela. Trump lacks the means to extract anything other than cheap spectacle from Venezuela. The downward spiral of the U.S. into idiocracy continues. Adam Tooze has put together a Chartbook on Venezuelan oil. Which likely won’t start to flow anytime soon: https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-423-some-topical-material Same as natural resources from Greenland… Which will need ports, airports, roads, powerplants, housing and amenities for the workforce, etc. All in a harsh climate. Greenland already has US military there since WWII, can’t they properly insure the US national security? Trump’s regime is notable for its incompetence – just like Zelensky in Ukraine, which is why, despite claims to the contrary, Putin has made it clear he wants to keep him in office for now, because better the incompetent leader you know is going to screw things up than a competent one that won’t. So, arguably it is better Chump stays in office and keeps screwing things up, than the far more competent Vance take over. However, the risk of major war keeps going up! Chump is deranged enough to ramp things up further. This Venezuela debacle has all the hallmarks of yet another botched regime change and resources grab job. If it was to prop up the petrodollar by making Venezuela revert to selling oil in dollars, so far nothing has changed – and won’t unless a puppet regime is installed, and even then it will take time before any change comes into effect. If it was to hurt Chinese and Russian interests in the country, they will retaliate in other ways to hurt the US dollar and economy. The US has spent a huge amount of money, well into the billions, just to kidnap one man, and bribe the military not to defend the country, and has so far failed to achieve anything much. Chumps’ threats to other countries will merely accelerate the move/rush away from the dollar and the dumping of US treasuries, thus putting even more downward pressure on the dollar. Making enemies at such a rapid rate will soon overwhelm the US. It can’t fight everyone! This article: The Venezuelan Oil Narative is PURE THEATRE -The Real Reason the Pentagon Approved Venezuela: Critical Minerals and Adversary Expulsion pins the motive on a threefold confluence of risks to the Pentagon: 1, The Pentagon’s Critical Minerals Crisis – along side China’s Supply Chain Stranglehold of the critical minerals in Venezuela; 2, IRGC: Iranian Weapons Manufacturing in the Western Hemisphere; 3, Russian Military Advisory Mission and Systems.

BUMPER TO BUMPER traffic at peak hours has become a feature of modern life in Ireland’s cities, with road users reporting ever-worsening gridlock on key routes. From the Quincentennial Bridge in Galway, to the Dunkettle Interchange in Cork, to the M50 and N7 and other roads around Dublin, along with every other city, commuters can lose hours of their days stuck in traffic. On the M50, Ireland’s busiest road, any closing of a lane as a result of a crash or debris can result in huge delays. The motorway has seen a 40% increase in traffic on its busiest stretches over the past 10 years. Recently Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) stated that it had “done all it can” in terms of works and upgrades to address the gridlock. Meanwhile, it has not been much better for anyone using public transport, with a senior Dublin Bus official recently citing data that showed traffic in the capital has become slower than London. Across the country, there are plans underway to revamp the roads network and to expand transport services – but some of these have faced repeated delays, whether due to planning struggles or financing from government. Most recently Firethorn Limited and Manhattan Peanuts lodged a judicial review against the planned Luas extension to Finglas in north-west Dublin city. We asked our readers to outline some of their main traffic complaints. Here’s what they said. Unsurprisingly, the main issue brought up had to do with traffic on the M50, and the knock-on effect this had on other areas around Dublin. One reader said he had to drive from Cherrywood to Santry on the run up to Christmas to collect a parcel at a depot. “I left at around 4.20pm, but by the time I made it to Santry, it was nearly 6.30 and the depot had closed at 6pm. Two hours to cross the breadth of the M50. The M7 and M4 exits in particular looked awful,” they said. They tried again a few days later, this time heading from Artane to Santry, what should be a much shorter journey. “This time from Artane to the same depot. It took an hour each way. I wish I was joking, but the gridlock was that bad,” the readers said. “At least I got the package! Perhaps the grim weather was to blame but still, that’s a really long time to cross 3 kilometres as the crow flies. Another reader, who lives in Ballyfermot, said they had experience multiple traffic jams as result of traffic on the M50. They were travelling from Smyths Toy Store at Fotnhill Retail Park to their home in Ballyfermot, a journey that would take about 15 minutes in light traffic. “It took one and a half hours to get out of the carpark and two hours to get home to Ballyfermot. This should have been a 15 minute journey!” The reader said. On another day soon after that, the reader went to collect her husband at the Hermitage Hospital in Lucan. “We could not get out of the car park. It took us one and a half hours to get home, we can normally do this trip in 15 minutes,” she said. The reader blamed traffic on the M50 for having a knock-on effect elsewhere. “When there is an incident on the M50 it causes enormous traffic jams in Ballyfermot as drivers drive through their to avoid delays on the M50,” she said. A final reader raised issue with traffic coming into Dublin, comparing their trip into Dublin on the N7 to Merrion Square, to when they drove in London. “I lived in London for six months last year. My commute to work consisted of driving from Finchley to around Cheshunt, the drive was 24 km and in bad traffic would take 40/45 mins on a bad day during rush hour traffic,” they said. “On the other hand I drove from the far side of Limerick City last week to Dublin. “It took me less time to get from Limerick to passing in by An Poitín Stíl (in Rathcoole) which is 195 km, compared to getting from An Poitín Stíl to Merrion Square that took me 2 hours on the dot and is only 18 km away and there were no road closures or crashes… just traffic.” Advertisement Readers also raised issues with traffic coming in and out of Galway City at peak times. “Traffic gridlock in Galway has been getting worse in the last few years but especially in the last year,” one woman told The Journal. “The Quincentennial Bridge in the mornings eastbound to the factories in the Parkmore/Ballybrit areas are a constant line of cars. The reader also said that the Dublin Road inbound and outbound are “constant traffic jams any time of day”. A bypass for Galway City – the Galway City Ring Road – has long been planned and debated. An Coimisiún Pleanála is due to make a decision on the road early this year. Another reader, who “drives daily for a living in Galway” decried the traffic and improper planning in the city, and called for the ring road to be built. “Galway’s annual descent into gridlock in the weeks leading up to Christmas is often blamed on shoppers, tourists, or poor driving behaviour, but the core problem is structural,” they wrote. “The absence of a completed ring road means that through traffic — vehicles with no destination in the city at all — is forced to funnel directly through already constrained urban streets. This fundamental planning failure magnifies congestion every December, when traffic volumes naturally rise.” The reader said that this forced the city to attempt to deal with local traffic and long-distance vehicles, which it fails to do. “The result is chronic congestion on key corridors, unreliable journey times, and mounting frustration for residents, workers, and businesses alike. Christmas simply exposes the problem at its worst.” The reader said that the ring road would also help improve sustainable transport options in the city, like public transport, walking and cycling. “Road space in Galway is scarce, and as long as it is dominated by through traffic, there is little political or practical room to reallocate it. “A functioning ring road would remove a significant volume of cars and trucks from the city centre, freeing space for continuous bus lanes, safe cycle infrastructure, and improved pedestrian environments. Public transport could become faster and more reliable, active travel safer and more attractive. Other readers shared local traffic issues in the outskirts of the cities. One reader who lives on the outskirts of Cork City said their morning commute takes 45 minutes, or 15 minutes with no traffic. “Nowhere near as bad as Dublin. Despite this as a family I am so frustrated by traffic and the lack of real alternatives,” they said. “If you look around Carrilgaline, Glanmire, Ballincollig, Maryborough, Lehenaghmore you will find massive newish housing developments with thousands of young families and kids and teens with zero infrastructure and zero amenities. “More often than not: No local shop. No crèche for the 100s of kids. No pub. No restaurant. No school. No playground. Nothing for teens to do. No GP. No dentist. No pharmacy. No bike lanes, no active travel supports. Limited bus routes, no bus shelters Zero, nothing, zilch. “And then we wonder why traffic is so bad?? ‘Cos we have to drive everywhere all the time for everything. Drive into Carrigaline, down to Douglas, over to Wilton. All stuck in traffic all wondering why traffic is so bad all the time!! Another reader took issue with traffic in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area of South Dublin, saying that there were now numerous traffic jams “all over the Dún Laoghaire, Glenageary, Deansgrange, Blackrock areas”. The reader said the jams were caused by “out of sync lights” and “unused cycle lanes that shut off parts of the road”. “I have no idea why the council closed off the feeder lanes at colossal expense and disruption,” they said. As well as the issues raised, some readers raised proposed solutions to the problems. The reader who lived out the outskirts of Cork proposed a variety of responses. These included: A final reader, living in Kildare but commuting to Dublin every day, said he is “a true believer in public transport but have mostly given up” and that he is “ashamed at how bad we’ve let it become, considering we’re such a small, flat country”. This readers commutes 30km to and from Dublin today. Where he lives has a direct train line to the city, he he cycles “because it’s faster (75mins vs 90mins minimum) and I can guarantee my arrival time(s)”. He said the city and surrounding area needed new train and metro lines to get people off the roads; double-tracking existing railway lines; connectivity between orbital train stations adding new stations. “I’d love to talk more about cycling infrastructure, but we can only properly tackle that once we do the big things properly,” he said.

The rebranding was announced by SGX Group CEO Loh Boon Chye at a ceremony at the SGX Centre’s IPO Arena. “This reinforces its role as the core pillar of SGX group’s multi-asset ambitions and its importance to Singapore as an international financial centre,” Loh said. The announcement comes as Singapore’s equity market shows signs of recovery. The STI delivered a total return of over 25 per cent in 2025, reaching record highs. Over five years, the index has gained more than 100 per cent in Singapore dollar terms, according to National Development Minister and Monetary Authority of Singapore deputy chairman Chee Hong Tat. The total market value of SGX-listed companies crossed the $1 trillion mark in 2025, while the average daily traded value for the year was the highest since 2010. Trading volumes in small- and mid-cap stocks surged more than 40 per cent compared to 2024. IPO activity rebounded significantly, with over $2.4 billion raised in 2025 - the strongest showing since 2019. The recovery follows a $5 billion Equities Market Development Programme led by MAS, with $3.95 billion already allocated to nine asset managers, including BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management. “Our journey to rebuild a vibrant stock market has started well in 2025, but all stakeholders must work even harder this year,” Chee said, cautioning that sustained effort is needed. The STI, launched in 1966 as the Straits Times Industrial Index, now tracks Singapore’s top 30 blue-chip companies and represents about 85 per cent of the market’s total capitalisation. The three local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB, account for nearly half of the index’s weight. Published on January 5, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Nicox Announces Complete Repayment of Kreos Capital Debt and Extends Cash Runway Beyond 2027 with New Additional Financing

January 05, 2026 01:30 ET | Source: NICOX SA NICOX SA Press Release Nicox Announces Complete Repayment of Kreos Capital Debt and Extends Cash Runway Beyond 2027 with New Additional Financing January 5, 2026 – release at 7:30 am CETSophia Antipolis, France Nicox SA (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0013018124, ALCOX), an international ophthalmology company, today announced repayment of all secured debt and extension of its cash runway beyond 2027 with an additional unsecured financing. “The full repayment of our debt to funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital announced today removes a number of obligations on the Company as a result of the security interests granted over Nicox’s assets. In the last 24 months, we have demonstrated our ability to meet our timelines and fulfil our obligations, and we appreciate the support that our long-term debtholders have given us,” said Gavin Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “To reinforce our cash position and better manage our resources, we have taken the opportunity to continue our successful collaboration with our financing partner and shareholder, Vester Finance. Based on our current cash on hand and the current timelines, this additional financing of up to €4 million extends our cash runway beyond the end of 2027. We are now in a healthier and significantly stronger position to navigate the future, including in our strategic discussions.” Nicox has fully repaid all outstanding debt with funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital1 using existing cash at 31 December 2025, thereby releasing all security guarantees over Nicox assets and terminating the right for Kreos Capital to appoint an Observer to the Board of Directors. This transaction coincides with raising new financing through the issuance of bonds to European investors, including Vester Finance, a current financing partner and established institutional investor. This financing consists of an issue of €3 million of convertible bonds and €1 million of ordinary bonds (subject to certain conditions precedent) and extends the Company’s cash runway beyond the end of 2027. This financing does not have any guarantee or security interest associated with it. Nicox is continuing to evaluate future strategic growth opportunities, including collaborations or business combinations. Key Future Milestones Cash Runway Based on the expected upcoming milestones, including the submission of an NCX 470 New Drug Application in the U.S. and a standard review period of 12 months, the financing announced today and the repayment of the Kreos Capital debt, the Company believes that its current activities are financed to beyond the end of 2027. The Company remains committed to cost control and optimizing resource allocation while maintaining the capabilities required to support our strategic objectives. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change, this may impact the cash runway. Potential proceeds from existing warrants and the €1 million additional bond financing, subject to certain conditions precedent, are not included in the above cash runway calculation. Full Repayment of the Kreos Capital Debt Nicox originally subscribed to a secured long-term debt with funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital totalling €20 million in 2019. Today’s payment reimburses the remaining outstanding balance of that debt in totality. In accordance with the amendment announced on 14 October 2024, Kreos Capital retains 17 warrants giving the right to acquire 400,000 shares per warrant in Nicox at €0.25, which can be exercised until 14 October 2036. As of 31 December 2025, Nicox’s remaining debt amounted to €0.3 million, consisting entirely of the outstanding balance of a COVID loan, which will be repaid from cash in hand by the end of August 2026. New Bond Financing from Institutional Investors The issuance of the convertible bonds was carried out based on the delegation granted by the Company’s shareholders during the General Meeting held on June 27, 2025, under the 13th resolution2. The convertible bonds, with a nominal unit value of €10, were subscribed at 92% of their nominal value for a total subscription price of €3,000,028.00, paid in full on the day of subscription. The bonds bear no interest and are unsecured. The bonds are convertible at any time, at a conversion price determined based on the stock market price3 at the time, in accordance with pricing rules and the ceiling set by the shareholders’ meeting. The ordinary bonds with a nominal unit value of €9.20, have been subscribed by the same investors at 100% of their nominal value, for a total subscription price of €1,000,003.20. They do not bear any interest nor guarantees and have the same term as the convertible bonds. Their subscription price will be made as one payment, at the moment when certain conditions have been met, at the latest at the start of September 2026. At a term of 24 months following the issuance of the debt, the bonds will be redeemed at maturity at 100% of their nominal value if they have not been converted at that date. This transaction was advised by Vester Finance, which is also a subscriber to these bonds. For illustrative purposes, if all convertible bonds were converted based on the Nicox share closing price on December 31, 2025, a shareholder holding 1% of the capital (calculated on the basis of the number of outstanding shares as of December 31, 2025) prior to the issuance and conversion would hold 0.876% of the capital on a non-diluted basis and 0.650% on a fully diluted basis. The new shares issued from conversion will be subject to all the provisions of the Company’s bylaws. They will be fully fungible with existing ordinary shares and will carry the same rights. Risk Factors Risk factors affecting the Company are detailed in section 3 of the “Rapport Annuel 2024” and in section 4 of the “Rapport semestriel 2025” which are available on Nicox’s website (www.nicox.com). Since the conversion price of the bonds set out above is linked to the Company’s share price, the exact number of shares to be issued upon conversion cannot be determined at the time of issuance, and such conversion may significantly dilute existing shareholders. Impact on the shareholder’s situation and on the distribution of share capital The following table, provided for illustrative purposes only, outlines various scenarios regarding the impact of the issuance of new shares resulting from the conversion of convertible bonds on the shareholder’s situation, depending on the evolution of the share price. *Closing price at 31 December 2025, i.e. €0.2980**Calculated on the basis of 88,441,773 Nicox shares as of December 31, 2025 The table below presents the Company’s share capital structure before and after the conversion of the convertible bonds, based on information available to the Company, and on the assumption that all the bonds are converted at a conversion price corresponding to the closing share price as at 31 December 2025: Prospectus – Admission to trading The bonds will not be subject to any application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth. This issue does not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). Termination of the PACEO4 Equity Financing Line The PACEO Equity Line with Vester Finance announced on 6 March 2025 and extended on 8 August 2025 is now finished. It has permitted Nicox to raise €3.9 million, through the issuance of 15,000,000 new shares.

Title: ESG Hits Record $799B in ETF Assets Globally

Investors are still flocking to environmental, social and governance funds, even as criticism has grown louder on Capitol Hill. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com ESG may be the most controversial acronym in finance, but don’t tell that to ETF investors. Environmental, social and governance exchange-traded funds reached a new milestone, with global assets climbing to $799 billion through the end of November, according to ETFGI data. The category pulled in $5.7 billion in November alone, bringing year-to-date inflows to almost $49 billion, a 25% increase over the prior year. But it also comes at a pivotal time, as asset managers continue to downplay ESG labels and critics on Capitol Hill have accused fund managers of everything from political bias to regulatory overreach. The resurgence of ESG funds could also become a savvy play for financial advisors looking to attract younger, more sustainability-minded clients. “Political winds are fickle, but long-term investors recognize reality,” said Max Kulyk, founder of the fee-only planning firm Chicory Wealth. “Criticism from lawmakers has only turned up the volume.” Last year’s sales tally ranked sixth-highest on record, though it trailed years during ESG’s heyday: Inflows peaked at $147 billion in 2021. Broad strategies attracted the bulk of assets, but investors also directed money toward clean energy, green bonds and transition-focused funds. “What we are actually seeing is the ‘weeding out’ of products that were never truly impact investments to begin with,” Kulyk said. “Products [got] slapped with an ‘ESG’ label during the boom a few years back, opaquely structured as ETFs or mutual funds, with no transparency into the environmental or societal impact of the companies within them.” The data also show: “Under the current political climate, ESG as a label has come under attack,” said Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital. “Yet, business concerns about the material aspects of the environment, human capital and governance are more pertinent than ever.” It’s Not Easy Being Green. One of the longstanding issues has been finding a standardized criteria for ESG products. That still seems to be the case with 56% of adopters saying there is a lack of clarity around what the strategy actually means, according to a survey cited in the data. Younger generations, like millennials and Gen Z, are especially motivated by sustainability and are choosing financial advisors based on it, Hull said. “As the Great Wealth Transfer takes place, women and younger investors see climate as a key risk factor and want their money aligned with the economy they want to see.” ETF investors may seek asset classes they view as safer in a volatile era. One issuer filed for a Venezuela Exposure ETF. The company’s crypto exchange-traded product push might be more about the tech than the individual products, one observer said. Actively managed funds have the potential for outsized returns, but timing is everything. ARK ETFs did well. Vega Capital Partners filed for 16 highly leveraged ETFs not long after the SEC told other issuers that such products wouldn’t fly. Tuttle’s GRFT fund aims to capitalize on the links between power and profit in government but was turned away by all the major US exchanges. ETF Launches, flows and assets were higher than ever in 2025, as issuers and investors expanded into niche categories. ETFs, particularly strategies built around AI and crypto assets, saw massive growth among RIAs this past year. Advisors are expected to utilize more artificial intelligence tools next year and even launch their own chatbots. The five funds with the best returns tracked companies that mined precious metals, with one ETF up 200% year-to-date. Dozens of companies recently got approval from the SEC to add ETF share classes of mutual funds and vice versa, something they’ve waited years for. The funds have taken in tens of billions of dollars in inflows this year as enthusiasm for digital currencies continues. Allocations will go toward companies that exhibit favorable future estimates of cash flow, earnings per share, price targets and sales. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: Inflation, interest rates, EVs: what the ABC's business experts are watching in 2026

Please let us know analysis By Kirsten Aiken By Michael Janda By Daniel Ziffer By Gareth Hutchens By Alicia Barry By David Taylor By Stephanie Chalmers By Emilia Terzon Topic:Economic Trends and Indicators The Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock has already indicated the quarter's trimmed mean (or core inflation) will be key to the RBA's deliberations for interest rates in early February. (AAP Image/Dean Lewins) What are you watching in 2026 when it comes to the economy or markets? That's the question we put to the ABC's business journalists, presenters and commentators as we head into the new year. From the Japanese bond market to intergenerational inequality and from unemployment to electric vehicles, here's what they're keeping an eye on in 2026. Inflation is the indicator to watch in early 2026. In fact, set an alarm for 11.30am on January 28. That is when the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the December quarter's CPI. The Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock has already indicated the quarter's trimmed mean (or core inflation) will be key to the RBA's deliberations for interest rates in early February. Bullock could not have been clearer when fronting the media pack for the final time in 2025. She emphasised time and again the RBA is alert to the signs of a more broad-based pick-up in inflation. The jawboning saw financial markets immediately reprice rate expectations. But was it also a warning to Australians to watch their holiday budgets, as well as the federal government to rein in the public spending of recent years ahead of a rate rise? We have been given fair warning that the cash rate of 3.6 per cent could move higher in 2026. The likelihood of whether a hike could happen early in February, and at the RBA's first opportunity for the year, will become much clearer as early as 11.30am on January 28. Business editor Michael Janda will be interviewing the RBA's deputy governor Andrew Hauser on January 8. (AAP: Lukas Coch) What will happen to unemployment in 2026? Australia's unemployment rate touched a 50-year low of 3.4 per cent in October 2022, but it has been slowly grinding higher for the last three years. In November it was 4.3 per cent. The Reserve Bank thinks it will need to settle around 4.4 per cent for inflation to be under control. Economists like to point out that an unemployment rate of 4.4 per cent is still low by modern historical standards. Between 1993 (when inflation-targeting began) and the start of 2020 (when the COVID pandemic hit), the unemployment rate averaged 6.3 per cent. So if inflation can settle back down inside the RBA's 2-3 per cent target range, and the unemployment rate can stay around 4.4 per cent, the RBA will take that as a win. But if unemployment keeps rising, and other measures of "spare capacity" in the labour market (underemployment, youth unemployment, etc) keep deteriorating, the RBA's hopes of "locking in" the hard-won employment gains from the COVID lockdowns may blow away with the wind. Like most mortgage borrowers, I'll be watching interest rates closely in 2026. But what are they going to do? After the Reserve Bank's most recent rate cut in August markets were confident there'd be another two rate cuts by February, which would have taken the cash rate to 3.1 per cent, with a fair chance of a third cut before 2026 was done. Fast forward past a couple of shockingly high inflation numbers and a press conference where Michele Bullock laid bare on the table that the choice now was between rates on hold and rates rising, and that market pricing has flipped completely. Traders now collectively think there's close to a 40 per cent chance of a rate rise in February, a near-certainty of one by June, and a better than 50-50 chance of two before the end of 2026. I attend almost every one of RBA boss Michele Bullock's press conferences, sit in all their Statement on Monetary Policy media lock-ups, and even have the odd one-on-one background chat with senior officials. So what do I think? If I was a betting man, I'd wager on an extended hold because, as my colleague Gareth Hutchens points out, the jobs market looks a little shaky and I think the RBA would want to wait and see how things develop before raising rates. But, as Kirsten Aiken notes, another couple of shockers for inflation data coming out on January 7 and 28 could force the bank's hand as early as February. I'll be interviewing the RBA's deputy governor Andrew Hauser on January 8, so maybe he'll give us a bit of a steer… but I wouldn't bet on it. Housing has become increasingly unaffordable for younger Australians. (ABC News: John Gunn) Intergenerational inequality is the biggest thing. Younger people are being saddled with debt (personal and government) face the dizzying cost of dealing with the climate crisis and housing… Housing? I've only been given 200 words and I'm trying to swear less. Our tax settings. Our benefits. The divergent ways we treat income from work and income from assets (like homes and shares). In the second year of a second term, this is the time for Labor to take dramatic shifts to re-balance systems that overwhelmingly preference older and wealthier people. For the Coalition the choice is much simpler: change or die. The Australian Electoral Study demonstrates the "conservative maturation" theory — that people vote more conservatively as they age — isn't happening. Some Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) are 45-years-old: this year the Coalition won just 21 per cent of that group. I don't think anyone, as they gently rub the back of their grizzling baby through a sleepless night, with a long day of work stretching in front of them, thinks: "When my children do this, I hope things are harder for them." But that's what we've done. We need to change it. For the first time, in the inner city it seems feasible to own an EV without at-home charging capacity, with more councils rolling out street charging. (Troy Sincock, ABC) In 2026 I'm going to be watching how electrification is accelerating in our economy. I live in inner Sydney, so I'm very aware it's a particular type of bubble, but it is a very populous one. The increased number of electric vehicles on our roads is incredibly noticeable. That's reflected in the government's decision to review its Electric Car Discount, citing industry data showing EVs now comprise about 10 per cent of new vehicle sales. Car manufacturers had been accused of dumping their least efficient petrol cars in Australia, as we trailed other jurisdictions in restrictions on the sale of new combustion engine cars (although it seems Europe may be winding back its planned ban). Now, there's talk of China flooding the market with cheap EVs — the number of models available here has skyrocketed. Whilst you used to only see the odd top-end Tesla, you'd now be hard pressed to take a glance at Parramatta Road and not spot a bunch of BYDs and mid-range EVs from the major manufacturers. The second-hand EV market will keep gaining more depth too. For the first time, in the inner city it seems feasible to own an EV without at-home charging capacity, with more councils rolling out street charging. The government has also said energy retailers will need to offer free power in the middle of the day, to spread the benefits of solar beyond those who can afford panels and batteries, including to renters. So is 2026 the year of electrification for the masses? Let's see. The low interest rate 'risk on' environment supported gains in risky assets like equities across the board, particularly in technology stocks. (ABC News: John Gunn) If rates move higher will investors have to work harder for returns? Active managers, who focus on the performance and outlook of individual companies have had a tough run in the last few years locally, outpaced by passive money chasing the benchmarks, like index funds. The low interest rate "risk on" environment supported gains in risky assets like equities across the board, particularly in technology stocks. Blackrock strategist for APAC and the Middle East Ben Powell says if rates drift higher, investors need an active investment strategy, "having to pick where we have conviction, be that in artificial intelligence or elsewhere. Because the central bankers, they're still nice people, but they're constrained by inflation from being quite as supportive for risk and for markets as we all got used to." So where to look if rates go up? Citi says AI won't dominate quite as much in 2026 and expects cyclical stocks (those exposed to economic cycles like miners) to do well. The investment bank prefers financial stocks over consumer staples (which are typically seen as defensive). It's possible 2026 will finally be the year of the stock picker. A woman walks past an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo Monday, Aug. 17, 2020. Japanese stocks sank while other Asian markets gained Monday after Japan reported a record economic contraction as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on retailing, investment and exports. (AP: Eugene Hoshiko) All eyes will be on the Bank of Japan in coming weeks and months. It's considered a giant funding source to the world's global financial markets, especially Wall Street. In past decades Japanese interest rates have been extremely low. Known as the carry trade, investors would borrow yen from Japan and invest in US assets including Treasury bills and stocks on Wall Street, which offered relatively lucrative returns. On December 19, the Bank of Japan, keen to hit its inflation target of 2 per cent and with one eye on increased business confidence, hiked its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75 per cent. In contrast the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate stands at 3.6 per cent. Immediately following the announcement, the Japan 10-year government bond yield rose above 2 per cent — it's highest level since 1995. Trillions of dollars are tied up in and around the carry trade and Japanese investments in the US. The key question is how high Japanese interest rates need to go before borrowing from Japan becomes too expensive, overriding future returns from US assets. In this case, large flows of money could return home to Japan, deeply cutting into Wall Street liquidity and, potentially, Australian superannuation funds currently heavily exposed to American markets. Australian businesses were caught out by US President Donald Trump's global upheaval in 2025. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst) I'll be watching out for more tariff turmoil. Australian businesses — from beef producers through to bikini designers — were caught out by US President Donald Trump's global upheaval in 2025. We even had Australia Post temporarily suspend most shipping to the US! Many businesses are still recovering from the disruption to their supply chains and pricing structures, especially those that manufacture goods in China and then import them into the US. I'll be looking out for how the Australian government, including Austrade, deals with any more disruption, and of course at any more tariff directions out of the White House.

Title: Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025

BlackRock pushed into digital assets massively in 2025, with on-chain data revealing just how aggressive the leading asset manager became in accumulating Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Title: Top 10 crypto fundraising rounds in 2025 — and what they mean for 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-03T06:00:00Z

About us Copy link Fundraising by crypto businesses reached over $25 billion in 2025, shattering analysts’ expectations that companies would raise just north of $18 billion. The top 10 raises alone brought in over $10 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Leading investors this year include not only tech-centric firms like Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, but also white-shoe stalwarts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The blockbuster deals underscore the convergence between crypto and traditional financial institutions, according to Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto investment firm BlockSpaceForce. “The line between fintech, TradFi, and crypto will continue to blur,” Chong told DL News. “Blockchain rails will increasingly sit in the background, improving settlement, custody, and programmability, while most crypto-specific complexity is abstracted away from end users,” Chong said. In the converging environment, the main dynamic is companies with a big client base splurging to buy infrastructure firms, regardless of whether they started as fintech or crypto, he said. “Stablecoins and tokenised assets will keep growing because they solve obvious problems for banks, funds, and corporations,” he said. Here are the top 10 biggest raises in 2025. In March, crypto exchange Binance raised $2 billion in a strategic round led by Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX. The raise is the largest single investment in crypto history and marks a key milestone in Binance’s post-regulatory transformation, as it doubles down on institutional services and compliance infrastructure. In October, US President Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the former Binance CEO who served a four-month prison sentence in 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US laws by failing to do enough to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court filings. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told DL News that Zhao was “prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” In October, Prediction platform Polymarket locked in a $2 billion strategic raise led by the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company ICE. “Our investment blends ICE [with] a forward-thinking, revolutionary company pioneering change within the decentralised finance space,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE CEO. The $2 billion dollar investment certainly raised a few eyebrows, but Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at Intercontinental Exchange, said in November that Zohran Mamdani’s New York City mayoral election win vindicated the sale. Bettors had given Mamdani overwhelming odds to win. “I was so nervous,” Blaugrund said at an event. “Because regardless of where my politics are, if Mamdani didn’t win, we would have overpaid for Polymarket.” In June, Stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1 billion in its August public offering in one of the most high-profile crypto raises on Wall Street. Now trading at just over 150% above IPO price, Circle is trying to position as critical dollar infrastructure for digital payments by focusing on global rollout, public sector partnerships, and expanding its compliance-based treasury rails. The raise underscores how stablecoins are entering Wall Street. In August, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish debuted on public markets raising $1.1 billion. Its automated market maker-style trading model and regulated-first positioning made it attractive to institutional investors seeking exchange exposure with minimal counterparty risk. The firm said it will use the funds to grow in Asia and Europe while doubling down on proprietary trading and data services. It currently trades near $39 per share at time of reporting, or just slightly above its IPO price. In December, betting platform Kalshi announced it closed a $1 billion Series E led by Paradigm and a16z. The Polymarket rival, focused on real-world event contracts, said it aims to become the Nasdaq analogy of prediction markets. As demand for hedging against macroeconomic, weather, and politics grows, Kalshi is launching hundreds of new tradable events and lobbying for further regulatory clarity. In September, blockchain lender Figure Technology raised just over $787 million in an IPO. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office alone invested $50 million, Reuters reported. Built on the Provenance Blockchain, the firm tokenises home equity loans and other credit instruments. Institutional investors see Figure as a gateway to real-world asset tokenisation. In September, Kraken pulled in $600 million in a pre-IPO round to prepare for a 2026 public offering. Previous report had stated that the crypto exchange had raised a $500 million round, but the company only confirmed the actual number in November as it not only officially announced plans to go public in 2026, but that it had also secured another $200 million in a strategic investment from Citadel Securities at a $20 billion valuation. The raise is “a milestone that reflects years of work, discipline, and conviction,” co-CEO Arjun Sethi said on LinkedIn. “I am proud of our team and grateful for the partners who chose to join us. In July, memecoin launchpad Pump.fun stunned markets with a $500 million initial coin offering. The platform lets users mint new tokens instantly. Often dismissed as retail froth, Pump.fun’s raise shows investor appetite for high-risk, high-speed protocols remains relevant. The team has said it is investing in security upgrades and social trading features. In October, Stripe-incubated layer 1 blockchain Tempo raised $500 million to build a high-speed payments chain for USDC and USDT. Tempo targets global payroll and remittances with low-latency infrastructure. In December, Tempo released its first public test network. Tempo has lured several well-respected crypto researchers, executives, and software engineers, such as former Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist, former Optimism Labs CEO Liam Horne, and Rice University Professor Mallesh Pai. In September, fintech-as-a-service firm Rapyd closed a $500 million Series F round backed by BlackRock and Fidelity. Known for powering crypto-fiat APIs and stablecoin rails, Rapyd says it is now working on a multibillion-dollar acquisition strategy. It’s become critical middleware for businesses bridging traditional finance and DeFi.

Title: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As 2026 begins, XRP is starting the year on a bearish note, with investor sentiment plummeting to levels of extreme fear. Despite these challenging conditions, analysts are suggesting that this negativity may set the stage for a significant bullish reversal, drawing parallels to historical trends. Reports indicate that periods of extreme sentiment have often preceded XRP rallies with impressive gains, at times exceeding 1,000%. Data from Santiment indicates that bearish mentions of XRP are now running 20-30% higher than the subdued averages seen in November. This deepening negativity, coupled with XRP stabilizing between $1.8 and $1.9 mark, highlights “a classic market divergence”: sentiment continues to worsen while prices consolidate, suggesting that emotional capitulation is occurring faster than any fundamental deterioration. Beneath this wave of retail fear, however, institutional behavior paints a more positive picture. Spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of approximately $424 million in December alone, making them the best-performing crypto ETF product. This contrast between extreme retail sentiment—currently at an extreme fear level of 24—and substantial institutional accumulation, which stands at around $1.3 billion over the past 50 days, often precedes market reversals more reliably than sentiment readings alone indicate. For XRP, the current setup combines extreme fear readings with a social sentiment significantly above baseline levels, alongside price consolidation, creating a historical pattern that has led to substantial rallies multiple times since 2020. For instance, back in the 2020-2021 cycle, XRP dropped to $0.17 amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, followed by a 1,053% increase to $1.96 over just four months. Today’s scenario mirrors this past occurrence. With institutional accumulation diverging sharply from retail capitulation, historical data suggests that this combination yields a 70-75% chance of a bullish reversal within the next two to eight weeks. Current trading conditions for XRP sit at approximately $1.90, with the Fear & Greed Index at 24. This setup creates three potential scenarios. In the most favorable bullish scenario, the Trump administration could announce clear pro-crypto regulatory policies in the first quarter of the year, BlackRock might file an XRP ETF application, or the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could rapidly scale above $2-3 billion. Historically, when the Fear & Greed Index climbs from 24 into neutral territory (between 50 and 60), XRP often rallies between 30-50%, setting targets between $2.44 and $2.82. If bullish momentum continues into mild greed (70+), XRP could reach the $3.00-$3.20 range. In a more neutral scenario, sentiment may gradually normalize without dramatic catalysts, with ETF inflows continuing to average between $200-300 million monthly. As RLUSD organically grows through existing partnerships, fears could naturally subside over a span of six to eight weeks. As the Fear & Greed Index rises from 24 to the 45-55 range, XRP has typically appreciated between 15-25%, targeting between $2.16 and $2.35. If the support at $1.85 holds through January, and trading volume expands above $1.98, the price could extend toward $2.40-$2.50. In a bearish outcome, sentiment could linger in extreme fear (below 30) for over eight weeks without relief. A decisive break below $1.85 on substantial volume would see XRP testing support levels around $1.65-$1.70. The altcoin has surged by over 6% in the past 24 hours towards $1.98 amid a broader recovery in the crypto market.

Title: Bitcoin treasury slump deepens as 40% trade at discount: ‘It’s an abomination’

About us Copy link The trend that became the biggest boom of 2025 is starting the new year as a bust. At least 37 of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury companies now trade at discounts to their net asset value, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. That means nearly 40% of major treasuries are worth less than the Bitcoin they hold. “The initial hype is over,” Brian Huang, co-founder of investment platform Glider, told DL News. Indeed, the premium era has ended. For the first three-quarters of 2025, treasury companies enjoyed significant premiums on their holdings. That allowed them to issue new stock above their Bitcoin value, use the proceeds to buy more coins, and repeat the cycle — all without diluting shareholders. Scores of companies, many of them without any previous connection to crypto, rushed to emulate the trade. The boom meant nearly 200 public companies now collectively hold over 1 million Bitcoin worth around $96 billion. But that playbook only works when companies’ equity trades at a premium to the crypto on their balance sheets. Strategy, the sector’s pioneer, traded at more than double its Bitcoin value last year. Today it offers a 17% discount. The entire trade began to slump in October. Ultimately, just one Bitcoin treasury company, France’s The Blockchain Group, outperformed the 16% the S&P 500 returned to investors in 2025, according to a December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Every other treasury underperformed the bellwether S&P 500, and 60% of Bitcoin treasuries spent more on their Bitcoin than it’s now worth. For macro analyst Alex Kruger, the Bitcoin treasury trade ominously reminds him of a situation that Bitcoin dealt with exactly five years ago. “When it comes to analogies across cycles and Bitcoin Treasury companies, June 2025 is analogous to December 2020 and the Bitcoin Grayscale trade,” Kruger told DL News. In 2020, Grayscale traded at a 40% premium to its Bitcoin holdings, meaning investors paid $1.40 for every $1 of Bitcoin the trust held because it was the only way institutions could get regulated Bitcoin exposure. But then came Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Investors could get Bitcoin exposure easily on their BlackRock or Fidelity account, collapsing Grayscale’s appeal — and premium. Eventually, Grayscale’s product traded at a 50% discount, pinning down investors who were forced to sell at massive losses. The 37 Bitcoin treasury companies trading below NAV range from major players like Strategy and Twenty One Capital — two of the top five treasuries, which each have a 17% discount to their Bitcoin holdings — to smaller firms like Sweden-based H100 Group, which trades at a 32% discount, and Vanadi Coffee, which is valued by investors at a 61% discount to its Bitcoin holdings. Another five to six companies hover precariously close to 1.0x, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC at parity. Any modest equity drawdown could push them below NAV, and turn them into food for giants. Kruger reckons consolidation is on its way, as failed treasuries become acquisition targets. In September, Bitcoin treasury Strive purchased Semler Scientific in an all-stock transaction. Other treasury figures predict a similar scenario playing out. Katherine Dowling, president of Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, said the strongest digital asset treasuries that survive 2025’s year-end collapse will become even bigger — by acquiring the weak. “Bitcoin DATs will push through this current noise as well. We will also likely see some DAT M&A opportunistic activity,” Dowling previously told DL News. Companies trading below 1.0x mNAV cannot issue stock to buy more Bitcoin because doing so destroys shareholder value. Let’s say a treasury holds $100 million in Bitcoin but trades at a 30% discount, so its market cap is $70 million. If it issues $10 million in new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders now own $110 million in Bitcoin but the market cap only rises to $77 million. Shareholders got diluted for nothing. This dynamic destroys the entire treasury playbook, ending access to capital markets, the allegedly endless Bitcoin purchases, and the potential for an expanding premium. Instead, the scheme turns into no more than holding and hoping. “The model is an abomination,” said Kruger. Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

Title: The 14 global trends that will shape the climate in 2026

By Lili Pike, Bloomberg The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate clues in China’s new economic blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can diplomats make headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to developing countries for climate progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The clean tech revival continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear energy’s boom is just over the horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI bubble burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone wants a piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV market splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What will New York City do about BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate risk modeling gains steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US renewables face a bumpy road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s biggest climate attack is coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s fate will be decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California meet its climate goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody –With assistance from Akshat Rathi, Coco Liu, Danielle Bochove, Eric Roston, Kyle Stock, Laura Millan, Mark Chediak, Michelle Ma, Olivia Raimonde, Todd Woody, Will Wade and Zahra Hirji.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman's message (link) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company's authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). This implies future ETH prices of: These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate "implied" future BMNR prices** **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares "accessible" to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased. Shareholders are encouraged to review the Chairman's message and vote prior to the January 14, 2026 deadline and are welcome to attend the annual meeting on January 15, 2026, at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Title: Tom Lee urges BitMine shareholders to approve share increase ahead of January 14 vote

Tom Lee, chairman of ether ETH$3,154.07 treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR), urged shareholders to approve a board proposal for a sharp increase in the company's authorized share count. In a start-of-the-year message, Lee said the proposal to boost the company's number of shares to 50 billion from 500 million is not a precursor to a move to "dilute" shareholders. “[This]t doesn’t mean we’re issuing 50 billion shares. That’s what we want the total max shares to be,” Lee said. Acknowledging that a higher share count does make it easier to enable the company to raise capital, Lee reminded that it also allows BitMine to pursue opportunistic dealmaking and — most importantly, according to Lee — accommodate future share splits. Lee argued that BitMine’s share price has increasingly tracked ether since the company pivoted last year to make ETH its primary treasury asset. If ether's price rises over the years as he expects — as high as $250,000 if bitcoin reaches $1 million — splits will be necessary to keep shares "accessible" to the public. Lee framed the proposal within a broader thesis that Ethereum will play a central role in Wall Street’s push toward tokenized financial markets, pointing to public comments by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about blockchain-based market infrastructure. Lee has separately said he has been accumulating ether personally, aligning his macro view with BitMine’s treasury strategy. Lee reminded shareholders that they have until Jan. 14 to vote on the proposal, with BitMine’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 in Las Vegas.

And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The Clean Tech Revival Continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear Energy’s Boom Is Just Over the Horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI Bubble Burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone Wants a Piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV Market Splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What Will New York City Do About BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate Risk Modeling Gains Steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US Renewables Face a Bumpy Road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s Biggest Climate Attack Is Coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s Fate Will Be Decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California Meet its Climate Goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody Top photograph: Floating solar panels manufactured by Hanwha Solutions Corp. on the Hapcheon Dam in Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do province, South Korea, on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022.

Title: Russia’s little-known $13bn crypto secret set for 2026 takeoff

About us Copy link Russians are warming to crypto, encouraged by the country’s banks and regulators. And they’re using cutting-edge solutions to build an investment ecosystem that can sidestep Western sanctions, past, present, or future. For Moscow, the future of finance is digital — and it lives on a blockchain. But while they’ve turned to traditional digital assets like Bitcoin, analysts expect a Russian take on tokenised securities and commodities, industrial Bitcoin mining, and crypto derivatives to take off in 2026. Digital financial assets, Russia‘s take on the buzzy tokenisation trend also called DFAs, have grown by over a third to become a $13 billion market in 2025, the Russian central bank estimates. But unlike many of the tokenised commodities traded in the West, they’re built on private blockchains and can only be traded on domestic platforms that hold central bank-issued permits. They now sit at the centre of Russia’s blockchain-powered economic expansion plans. DFA issuers have released tokens tied to the value of everything from cocoa beans to St. Petersburg real estate. The total volume of Russian DFA placements in the first nine months of 2025 increased by 33%, Vitaly Plotnikov, the deputy director of the central bank’s financial market infrastructure department, told Russian news agency Interfax in early December. Yields on short-term DFAs this year exceeded short-term bond yields by an average of 1.7%, he added. And it’s set to grow. In early December, Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s commission on the financial markets and the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation, said boosting the DFA market will be a key economic priority for Moscow in 2026. Aksakov added that the government aims to achieve tax parity for DFA investors in 2026, placing them on the same tax footing as traditional bondholders. “This will allow the DFA market to grow significantly, attract money for longer periods, and accumulate resources for business and economic development,” Aksakov said. Moscow has granted operating licences to 16 more Russian firms since Atomyze issued its first DFA, according to Russian central bank data. While most of these license-holders are banks, in August, the bank also granted a DFA-issuing license to a startup named Madrigal, which offers DFA issuance-as-a-service products. The Moscow Exchange, or MOEX, and Russian banks are also championing so-called crypto derivatives. As Russians cannot buy shares in popular US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, MOEX and major banks have launched their own funds. ’The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations.‘ Those funds track the prices of popular BlackRock offerings, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The popularity of these products has ballooned since they launched in the summer. After breaking MOEX trading volume records in September, crypto futures trading volumes on MOEX reached $636 million, a new record for futures contracts, the Russian publication Tsargrad reported. Crypto derivatives look set to grow rapidly in 2026. MOEX, the St. Petersburg Exchange and major banks — such as T-Bank, Alfa-Bank, and Sberbank — have all either launched their own crypto derivatives this year, or plan to do so in early 2026. While the central bank has previously tried to ensure only super-rich, “super-qualified” investors can buy crypto-related products, the government wants to make them more accessible. And the central bank is accommodating. “The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations,” Aksakov said. Major lenders are ready to take a step further and are waiting for permission to let their customers trade Bitcoin directly from their banking apps. Bitcoin mining is another core crypto sector set to grow in Russia in 2026. Dmitry Stupin, Vice President of the Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain for Electricity Generation, told the Russian news agency TASS in November that mining volumes in Russia would recover to their 2024 peak of 2.1 to 2.2 GW in 2026 after dropping to around 1.7 GW in 2025. Stupin said that as industrial miners start using their own gas-fired power generation and upgrade their rigs, miners are set to return to their 2024 highs. The prediction does not seem far-fetched. After all, electricity is relatively cheap in energy-abundant Russia, and the cooling costs required to prevent mining rigs from overheating are minimal in famously cold regions like Siberia. Industrial mining was born in Southern Siberia in 2017, with the launch of the mining firm BitRiver. Since then, scores of competitors have emerged. In August 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law legalising industrial crypto mining. This paved the way for institutional and private investors to enter industrial crypto mining. In August, mining chiefs told the Russian media outlet RBC that it was only “a matter of time” before a major Russian mining company would seek a listing on MOEX.

Title: Solana enters 2026 with last-minute boost in RWA momentum

Solana finished the year with record tokenized RWA activity and strong inflows into Solana ETFs, which could push SOL toward new highs in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed Solana appears poised to expand from its memecoin-focused, retail-dominant network this year, after posting record real-world asset tokenization activity in December. Data from RWA.xyz shows the value of tokenized RWAs on Solana increased nearly 10% over the last month to a record-high $873.3 million, while the number of Solana RWA token holders rose over 18.4% to 126,236 over the same timeframe. The majority of these RWAs back US Treasuries, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and the Ondo US Dollar Yield, which boast market caps of $255.4 million and $175.8 million, respectively. New tokenized stocks like Tesla xStock and Nvidia xStock are also rising, at $48.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively, while institutional funds are also being tokenized on Solana. Solana is poised to become the third blockchain to exceed $1 billion in tokenized RWAs, behind Ethereum at $12.3 billion and BNB Chain, which recently passed $2 billion. Last month, crypto asset manager Bitwise predicted Solana would set a new all-time high should the US pass the market-structure-focused CLARITY Act in 2026. Related: Can Solana shed its memecoin image in 2026? If it passes, Bitwise expects crypto tokenization will take off, with Solana being one of the biggest winners from that upward trend: “We’re bullish on Ethereum and Solana. Really bullish. Primarily because we think stablecoins and tokenization are megatrends, and Ethereum and Solana are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of that growth.” Solana (SOL) enters 2026 at a significantly lower price than it began 2025, trading around $125 versus roughly $190 this time last year. SOL is also over 57% off the $293.3 all-time high it set on Jan. 19, 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) set their all-time highs more recently — October and August — and are currently trading much closer to those prices. Solana's legitimacy in the institutional space strengthened in late October when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first lot of now six spot Solana exchange-traded funds. Those Solana products have combined for $765 million in inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Also in October, international remittance giant Western Union chose Solana to build its stablecoin settlements platform on for its more than 150 million customers, spread across over 200 countries and territories. It is expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. Solana is leading all blockchains in app revenue, proving it can generate high income even when memecoin activity slows. Over the past 30 days, it raked in over $110 million, far ahead of second-place Hyperliquid at $61.1 million and nearly double Ethereum’s $47.2 million, DeFiLlama data shows.
