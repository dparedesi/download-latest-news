Title: Gerry Thornley: all four Irish provinces beaten on same weekend for first time since March 2015

All seems even less hunky dory underneath the surface after that weekend. For the first time since March 2015 all four Irish sides lost on the same weekend, on top of which the Ireland women’s team suffered their most sobering reality check of the campaign. That said, for those in Clontarf, Nenagh, Trinity, Dungannon, Skerries and Thomond it was the best weekend of the season. The last time all four Irish provinces lost on the same weekend was in the old Pro 12, when the quartet each suffered defeats to Welsh opposition. As then Leinster lost away to the Scarlets, while Munster, beaten in Cardiff on Friday night, lost to the Ospreys a decade ago. Connacht had a fall off in performance after their brave effort in defeat to the Stormers when losing to the Lions last Saturday, while Ulster were worn down by the Sharks’ superior physicality and depth on Saturday night. Leinster, of course, could afford just a second defeat of the season, especially as Glasgow were outmuscled at home by the Stormers on Friday night, so maintaining the eight-point gap at the top the table ahead of next Saturday’s Champions Cup showdown against a dangerous Northampton. Victory at home to Zebre a week later would ensure top seeding in the BKT URC playoffs ahead of their final game at home to Glasgow; additionally helpful if they have reached a fourth successive Champions Cup final a week later. By contrast Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all fallen outside the top eight, and there is a distinct likelihood that Ireland will only have two sides in next season’s Champions Cup for the first time ever, with the possibility that this may even be one side. That would be quite a fall. Munster and Ulster meet at Thomond Park next Friday week in what is now a dog-eat-dog scrap for playoff and Champions Cup qualification between two provinces who have been ever-presents in the 30 years of the latter competition. While Munster now sit ninth behind Benetton, with both on 41 points, by dint of winning less matches they have their destiny in their own hands as they also host the Italian outfit at Musgrave Park in the final round six nights later. By contrast an Ulster squad even more lacking in depth sit in 12th on 38 points, and so their need is the more acute in Thomond Park ahead of a trek to Edinburgh, who are 10th, on the ensuing Friday. Connacht’s chances of the top eight are more remote as they sit 14th on 35 points and must finish with wins at home to Edinburgh and away to Zebre if they are to have any chance of a top-eight place. Significantly, the Welsh quartet finish their campaigns with two games in South Africa. The fear always lurked that for all the huge improvement in the Ireland women’s team in the last 12 months some of it had to be attributed to the return of Olympian Sevens players who were unavailable in last season’s Six Nations, and that while they have become a good team they are not yet a good squad. In the absence of the hugely influential Sam Monaghan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer, that lack of depth was further exposed when losing Edel McMahon and Dorothy Wall in the first half of last Saturday’s loss to Scotland in Edinburgh. It’s still been a campaign of progress, with more competitive displays at home to England and France, as well as the high point of the win in Parma. But Saturday’s defeat is a setback psychologically, and certainly gives the first World Cup warm-up match against Scotland in Cork on August 2nd more significance. Either way while a World Cup semi-final is still a viable target, beating New Zealand again in the pool stages or overcoming France in the quarter-final looks a tall order, particularly after the stirring late comeback by Les Bleus in losing 43-42 in Saturday’s Grand Slam decider against England. Amid all this club rugby was seen at its best on the final weekend of the AIL as UL Bohs and Clontarf secured All-Ireland titles again at the Aviva Stadium. À la the Joey Carbery final when Clontarf beat Cork Constitution in 2016, last Sunday wasn’t quite the Hugh Cooney final, but it wasn’t far off it either. As a Clontarf centre who came through Blackrock, Cooney is not the first to plot such a journey, and while not wanting to saddle him unduly with comparisons to The Great One, with his leg power, explosiveness, pace and low centre of gravity the 21-year-old has similar attributes. Cooney and Hugh Gavin look like being the first of the new crop of young centres coming through to be capped this summer in Tbilisi or Georgia. Meanwhile Nenagh Ormond became the first Tipperary club to be promoted to Division 1A and Trinity preserved their 1B status with dramatic two-score comebacks at home to wilting UCC and Cashel sides. Dungannon won promotion to 1B by winning in Navan, Skerries stayed in 2B by beating Midleton at home, and Thomond reclaimed their AIL status by winning in Omagh in the only game that wasn’t a one-score affair. The league has found a niche. Ten-team divisions and playoffs ensure jeopardy and a dearth of dead rubbers until the very end. But having the finals a week after the semi-finals, which are just a fortnight after the three-game rush to the season’s final standings, is just too demanding a load for the mostly amateur and semi-pro players. The best final of recent times was two years ago, when Terenure beat Clontarf 50-24, which was a fortnight after the semi-finals. That’s the way it should be. The AIL finals could have been held next Sunday, on the May bank holiday weekend, which would also help rather than hinder clubs outside Dublin such as Cork Constitution in bringing members and fans to Dublin. It would also afford the IRFU, sponsors and finalists two weeks to promote the finals. The May bank holiday weekend should be enshrined in the club calendar as All-Ireland club rugby weekend. If occasionally this clashed with Leinster matches or the finals were lost to either TG4 or from the Aviva to somewhere else nor would that be the end of the world. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish drummer Kevin Brady: ‘Most nights you’re able to hear great live jazz. But we need something like classical has in the NCH’

Time Published: 2025-04-29T04:15:00Z
Full Content:
There is a photograph of the quartet led by the Irish jazz drummer Kevin Brady that makes it look a little like a Scandi death-metal band. The American keyboardist Bill Carrothers – buzz-cut, beard and steely eye – is decked out in camouflaged military-style hunting jacket. The London-born, Vancouver-raised and Cologne-based saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose father was from Dublin, is peering out over lowered eyebrows with what comes across as a combination of scepticism and menace. Brady, who is dressed, like Blake, all in black, is solemn, glassy-eyed and half in deep shadow. The Irish bassist Dave Redmond, to the rear, looks, as Brady jokes to me, “like he urgently needs to be somewhere else”. In reality, the group, which works under the banner of the Kevin Brady Electric Quartet – in which Carrothers plays Fender Rhodes electric piano, Redmond switches to electric bass and Brady is increasingly integrating electronic drum percussion – is one of the most acclaimed and ambitious international jazz ensembles working in Ireland. Formed in 2019, the band combines a highly intuitive and interactive Irish rhythm section that has played together for 20 years or more with two of the most gifted and admired, if sometimes criminally undervalued, musicians in modern jazz. Carrothers, who is based in Michigan, has a long association with Redmond and Brady – as a piano trio they have released three highly rated studio albums, many featuring Carrothers’s winningly eclectic compositions – and he is renowned for his harmonic elegance, broad musical knowledge and many-sided virtuosity. Blake, a master tenor saxophonist, is a muscular and commanding soloist somewhat in the Michael Brecker and Chris Potter mode, yet with his own elastic sound, advanced sense of lyricism and endlessly inventive style. The overall result lands in several sweet spots between late-1960s Miles Davis and early-1970s Herbie Hancock: liquid electric postbop with catchy melodies, deep grooves, rhythmic ingenuity, consummate improvisation and a strikingly contemporary edge. While the group’s multinational nature and heavily in-demand members may make regular creative get-togethers something of a challenge, the Electric Quartet has released one celebrated album, Plan B – “timeless, joyous music that will further burnish the reputations of all concerned”, according to the Irish Times review. Next month the band embarks on one of its rare tours of Ireland, playing seven dates across the island. Brady is a highly respected musician and teacher. A fluid and versatile drummer with a great sense of swing, he can play anything from funk to free jazz, but he is primarily influenced by some of the pioneering American drummers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Tony Williams, Max Roach, Jimmy Cobb, Art Taylor and Elvin Jones – as well as the irresistible polyrhythms of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music. “In the 20 years I’ve been coming to Ireland, Kevin’s the best drummer I’ve heard,” Carrothers says. As a side musician and group anchor, Brady, who is 51, has become exceptionally popular with bands both in Ireland and abroad. At home he has been a crucial member of groups led by the guitarist Tommy Halferty, the pianist Phil Ware and the keyboardist Scott Flanigan, and by the saxophonists Richie Buckley and Meilana Gillard; in addition he has performed and recorded with Irish acts ranging from Van Morrison to the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Gráda to Dave Geraghty of Bell X1. [ Kevin Brady Electric Quartet: Plan B – an engrossing new musical directionOpens in new window ] Brady has also worked with the English jazz vocalists Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw, the American saxophonist and 1960s James Brown creative force Pee Wee Ellis, and the American guitarist and “godfather of fusion” Larry Coryell, among many others. “I try to bring an emotional response to any music I’m involved in, and an energy,” he says. “I want the music to be active.” He is also the composer of tight, melodically strong and rhythmically dynamic tunes that defy the lazy commonplace that drummers are there to keep time, not contribute original music. “The idea that if you play drums you’ve got no sense of cop-on with regard to knowing what a scale or a chord or a melody is … I think we’re way past that now,” he says. We meet in the recital room of Newpark Academy of Music, in Blackrock in south Dublin – “this room has been the venue for masterclasses by many great visiting jazz musicians, including the drummer Art Blakey,” he says – where Brady has been teaching drums for approaching 25 years; he is also head of the jazz programme at the school and lectures on the BA jazz degree course at Dublin City University. For participants who range from toddlers to final-year secondary students, Newpark is “the gold standard of musical education in Ireland”; founded in 1979, it is a registered charity with 42 staff and 600 students. Hozier is one of its alumni. Last year, at short notice, it was threatened with closure. Brady was one of the leaders of the campaign that saved the centre; from September the academy will transfer to new, though as yet unannounced, premises nearby. “I think people saw the importance of what’s been achieved here, both in the past and for the future,” Brady says. “If you start closing down music schools that have legacies like Newpark, then that’s not a world I would like to be living in.” Brady was born in Dublin. Neither of his parents was a musician, though his father sang in local musical societies, had a large vinyl collection and was a passionate fan of big-band jazz, as well as of the artistry of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the singer Sarah Vaughan. He began private piano lessons at the age of six, progressing through to the highest grades; a couple of years later he began playing trumpet, and later cornet, in a local concert band that sometimes toured Europe. In his teenage years Brady began playing keyboards in local jam bands, moving to drums “purely by coincidence” when one drummer failed to show for a rehearsal. He began teaching himself, initially falling under the influence of Stewart Copeland, the multifaceted American drummer from The Police, and at 17 began lessons at Newpark with the drummer Conor Guilfoyle. “I remember Kevin being a really good student with a voracious appetite to learn; like he is now, he was a complete enthusiast,” Guilfoyle says. “He wasn’t playing jazz at this point, more funk and rock, but he had a really good time feel. And that’s essential. It means you can adapt to many different styles of music – and also that good musicians will always want to play with you.” Increasingly drawn towards jazz – one of the earliest sparks was the present his father gave him for Christmas when he was 13: Wynton Marsalis’s Marsalis Standard Time, Vol 1 – he gave up a place studying classical music at University College Dublin in favour of a life practising, taking private lessons and playing blues and rock gigs. When he was 22, on Guilfoyle’s advice, he studied for six months at the prestigious Drummers Collective in New York; shortly after he took the year-long newly formed professional musician training course at Newpark set up by Ronan and Conor Guilfoyle. He has never looked back. Since then, over the past quarter-century or more, he has led an exemplary jazz life in Ireland, albeit one that has not exactly made him wealthy. He has admirably sought to advance his skills by studying with drummers and percussionists in the United States, Cuba and Brazil. And, from his early 30s, he has led bands and developed a reputation for being enterprising and hardworking, for being the kind of musician who consistently makes things happen. “His determination and discipline towards grant writing and procuring gigs is pretty legendary. He’s a dog on a bone,” Carrothers says. As a linchpin of the domestic music scene, Brady is also extremely well placed to gauge the state of jazz in Ireland. “I think it’s pretty healthy,” he says, quick as a flash. “Most nights, in Dublin at least, you’re going to be able to hear great live jazz featuring both established and younger musicians. “But one thing we’re lacking as a major capital in Europe is a government-backed centre for jazz and improvised music,” he adds. “Somewhere with a 300- to 400-seat venue, education and outreach programmes, resources, an archive, all sorts of stuff that would promote and preserve the music. Something like classical music has in the National Concert Hall and trad has with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. [ Newpark Academy of Music saved from closure through licence reprieveOpens in new window ] “I know the audience is there, 100 per cent. As is the interest in jazz; I can see it in my students. But we need to follow through and take the initiative, take the next step. A dedicated venue would be a massive bonus not just for jazz in Ireland but for the whole country.” The Kevin Brady Electric Quartet plays the Yeats Building, Sligo, on Sunday, May 4th; Magy’s Farm, Dromara, Co Down, on Monday, May 5th; Riverbank Arts Centre, Newbridge, Co Kildare, on Wednesday, May 7th; Solstice Arts Centre, Navan, on Thursday, May 8th; Wexford Arts Centre on Friday, May 9th; Arthur’s Blues & Jazz Club, Dublin, on Saturday, May 10th; and Triskel Christchurch, Cork, on Friday, May 16th.

Title: Charlamagne tells Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer to 'cut it out' over hypocritical oligarchy concerns

CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a "very strong letter" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. "I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy," Charlamagne said on "The Breakfast Club" Monday. "Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors." "So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Charlamagne tha God is schooling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over what he calls their sudden apportion to big money in politics. (Getty Images) Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. "I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack," Charlamagne joked. "So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries." He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer "Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate," and said that he was "even less inspiring." Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be "thrown out of office."

Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Title: Man (66) who died while cycling was ‘meticulous’ in wearing safety equipment, inquest hears

A 66-year-old man who was “meticulous” in wearing safety equipment when cycling died from a severe brain injury after falling from his bike, an inquest has heard. A sitting of Dublin District Coroner’s Court heard that Conor Kenny, the head of a consultancy firm and author of several business books, died hours after setting off for a cycle to Ticknock woods in south Dublin. Judith Kenny said her husband, who was a regular runner and cyclist, was “meticulous” about safety equipment, which he was wearing when he left for his cycle on August 4th, 2024. She recalled ringing her husband several times after hearing “concerning” sirens near their home in Ballinteer in the hours after he left. Neville O’Connor, who was hiking on the day of Mr Kenny’s death, recalled seeing a cyclist pass him at a “fairly good speed” shortly before 1.30pm. After Mr Kenny rounded a bend ahead and was out of sight, Mr O’Connor heard a “very loud bang like a bike hitting the ground”. He said there were no cars in the area at the time. He ran to Mr Kenny who was still wearing his helmet, lying on the ground close to his bike and struggling to breathe. Mr O’Connor said he administered CPR until paramedics arrived and transferred him to St Vincent’s University Hospital. Dr Patrick Hillery, a consultant in emergency medicine, said Mr Kenny arrived in cardiac arrest. After all possible avenues were exhausted, he was pronounced deceased some 35 minutes later, the doctor said. He noted a significant volume of blood in Mr Kenny’s mouth “which would be consistent with an unprotected fall”. He believed Mr Kenny may have suffered a cardiac arrest before the fall. Garda Jason McDonnell, a member of the roads policing unit at Blackrock Garda station, said Mr Kenny’s smartwatch recorded a “sharp and sudden” drop in speed from 13.06 metres per second (47km/h) to 0 metres per second at 1.28pm. Garda McDonnell said the brakes and tyres of Mr Kenny’s bike were in good working order, and the site of the crash “wouldn’t be an area where you would have road traffic collisions”. A postmortem recorded the medical cause of death as severe craniocerebral trauma and noted a finding of amyloid angiopathy, a condition that causes bleeding into the brain, which could have caused a spontaneous bleed before his crash. Coroner Dr Clare Keane returned a narrative verdict, saying: “We are clear there was a fall from the bicycle, what we cannot conclude with certainty is whether the bleeding resulted from the fall or possibly precipitated it.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How Stablecoins And Tokenization Are Rebuilding Global Finance

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Stablecoins and tokenization take center stage. (Photo by May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket via ... More Getty Images) Late last year, I stood on stage at a fintech summit in Singapore talking about digital identity, stablecoins and tokenization, surrounded by leaders from central banks, blockchain startups, and AI innovators. It was one of those moments where you could feel history nudging forward. Discussions that used to live in niche corners of crypto Twitter were now center stage — about programmable money, the fragility of global currencies, and the reinvention of financial infrastructure. There was an electricity in the air, not of fear, but of change. What struck me most was the shared understanding across sectors: the old financial rails weren’t just aging. They were being replaced, reimagined, and rebuilt. Later in 2025, at a Digital Economist event with financial researcher Tarun Kishnani, we dug deeper into what’s really happening underneath the surface. This isn’t about headlines or hype. It’s about a fundamental rewiring of the architecture that underpins global commerce and power. Much of this transformation can be traced back to an imbalance that has been growing for decades. Over reliance on foreign manufacturing, ballooning trade deficits, and geopolitical tensions have chipped away at the U.S.’s unchallenged monetary position. In just the past few months, the Dollar has weakened more than 10% against a basket of global currencies — not because people stopped believing in the U.S. entirely, but because uncertainty is being priced in at the margins. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, warned that adversaries are actively working to dismantle the Dollar’s hegemonic role. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said what once would have been controversial: that U.S. debt mismanagement could erode the Dollar’s reserve status. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) The U.S. has long preserved Dollar dominance by keeping global demand high — from oil pricing to trade settlement systems. But the new levers of power are digital, decentralized, and dynamic. One of the clearest signals that global finance is evolving is the astonishing rise of stablecoins. In 2024 alone, stablecoins processed over $27 trillion in volume — more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoins are a category of digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, most commonly the U.S. Dollar. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly in value, stablecoins aim to offer the speed, transparency, and programmability of blockchain technology without the volatility. They are backed either by fiat currency reserves, commodities, or algorithmic mechanisms that manage supply and demand. Today, stablecoins like USDC and USDT serve as vital tools for global payments, trading, savings, and cross-border transactions — blending the trust of traditional finance with the efficiency of decentralized systems. Why are stablecoins growing so fast? They solve real-world problems. They offer instantaneous, low-cost transfers. They are transparent, programmable, and — in most cases — backed by U.S. Dollars. In a world increasingly skeptical of traditional intermediaries, stablecoins offer direct access to a stable financial anchor. As Tarun put it during our conversation, “Every time someone in Latin America or Southeast Asia loads USDC into a wallet, they’re extending the reach of the U.S. Dollar — without a single bank branch or military base.” Financial researcher Tarun Kishnani Stablecoins have become a new kind of financial infrastructure — invisible, efficient, and profoundly influential. While the surface of finance looks much the same — banks, apps, payments — the underlying rails are being transformed. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 upgrade is modernizing cross-border messaging to support tokenized assets. China’s CIPS network is providing an alternative to SWIFT for emerging markets. Meanwhile, blockchain-based settlement layers like Ethereum are allowing assets to move at internet speed, without traditional banking bottlenecks. This evolution isn’t a tech experiment anymore. It’s a full-scale reengineering of how value moves around the world. It's laying the groundwork for a future where money flows like information — fast, borderless, and programmable. Many assume decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) are locked in a zero-sum battle. But what’s actually emerging is a collaboration. Banks are experimenting with blockchain rails to streamline settlement and custody. DeFi platforms are embedding compliance features to attract regulated capital. The two systems are beginning to meet in the middle — with stablecoins acting as the connective tissue. Rather than disrupting for disruption's sake, this hybrid model is focused on resilience, innovation, and access. It’s not about breaking finance. It’s about upgrading it. Tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens — is moving from pilot projects into real deployment. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, put it succinctly: “Tokenization brings Wall Street efficiency to Main Street access.” Already, we’re seeing tokenized U.S. Treasuries gaining traction among global institutions looking for dollar exposure without the friction of traditional custody. Real estate platforms are tokenizing properties, allowing fractional ownership that enables more diverse participation. Corporates are beginning to tokenize debt instruments to reduce settlement times and financing costs. The potential is staggering: 24/7 markets, instant settlement, broader participation, and increased liquidity. And most of these assets are priced in Dollars — reinforcing the very monetary system many predicted would wane. Beyond the technical benefits, this new financial infrastructure could redefine access to opportunity. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized this broader mission: “This is our opportunity to build financial systems that don’t just work better—but work for more people.” Stablecoins and tokenized assets open doors for billions of people left behind by traditional banking. A farmer in Kenya can save in a stable currency. A startup founder in Vietnam can raise global capital. A student in Argentina can invest in tokenized U.S. equities. The goal isn’t just efficiency. It’s equity. It’s about creating systems that are open by design, not as an afterthought. Of course, this future is not without its challenges. Digital identity remains a crucial missing piece — without verifiable, portable identity, trust in ownership breaks down. Regulatory clarity is lagging behind technological innovation, leading to uncertainty for businesses and users alike. Technical risks — from smart contract vulnerabilities to blockchain outages — are real and must be managed with rigor. Moreover, the U.S.’s fiscal and political stability will continue to underpin Dollar confidence. Digital diplomacy through stablecoins is powerful, but it still rests on trust in the core institutions behind them. As you navigate this financial transformation with Stablecoins and Tokenization, the takeaway is clear: participation is no longer optional. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an investor, a policymaker, or simply someone managing personal finances, understanding how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and digital infrastructure work will soon be as fundamental as understanding credit cards or online banking. If you’re a business leader, now is the time to modernize infrastructure and explore how digital assets could streamline operations, reduce costs, and open new markets. If you’re an investor, learning how tokenization is reshaping access to real estate, bonds, and global equities could uncover new opportunities for diversification and growth. And if you’re a policymaker, the moment demands thoughtful regulation that encourages innovation while protecting stability and inclusion. For individuals, the implications are profound. Financial systems are opening in ways that will create more access, more ownership, and more agency for people worldwide — but only for those who engage early. Saving, investing, and transacting with digital tools will move from experimental to expected. The rails are being rebuilt around you. The next chapter of finance will be more borderless, transparent, and participatory than any that came before. The best time to start understanding this shift was yesterday. The second-best time is today. What do you think about Stablecoins and Tokenization?

WSB Now ATLANTA — The BlackRock Foundation has partnered with the Technical College System of Georgia to expand access to skill training for more than 1,000 state residents. According to the announcement from BlackRock, the BlackRock Foundation Empowerment Fund will provide $1 million over two years as a grant to the Technical College system. The foundation said the funding will be used to help TCSG students finish training programs and expand the pool of skilled workers for Georgia’s construction and advanced manufacturing industries. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks] “At The BlackRock Foundation, our mission is to help more people earn, save, and invest and that includes increasing access to pathways that lead to long-term financial security,” Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation, said in a statement. “This grant reflects our deep commitment to investing in the workforce of the future, and more importantly, putting more Georgians on a path to earning a thriving wage in the state’s highest demand industries.” TRENDING STORIES: Programs that will work with the new Empowerment Fund will go through WorkSource Georgia for existing advanced manufacturing and construction pre-apprenticeship programs, according to BlackRock. The grant will also give $720,000 for scholarships from the TCSGF’s ‘Last Mile Fund,’ to help students graduate despite potential financial burdens. “This partnership with The BlackRock Foundation is a powerful investment in Georgia’s future workforce,” Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia, said. “By helping more students complete training and earn credentials—especially in rural communities and high-demand fields—we’re not only changing lives, we’re building the talent pipeline that keeps Georgia the number one state for business." Dozier said the Empowerment Fund was a good example of how public and private partnerships can expand opportunities across Georgia, help close skill gaps and support economic mobility.

Title: Looking beyond Pi Network? 5 underrated cryptos could 1000x in May’s bullish rebound

As the crypto market gears up for a potential surge, interest is shifting toward hidden digital assets with explosive growth prospects. Investors are eager to uncover the next big opportunity beyond well-known names. This article delves into five overlooked cryptocurrencies that might experience a hundredfold increase during May’s bullish momentum. XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key strengths of XYZVerse in the current market: Price prediction for $XYZ Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Is a 3000% surge possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Ondo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending traditional finance with blockchain, Ondo turns real-world assets into digital tokens. These assets are stable and earn income, like US Treasuries. This opens up high-quality financial products to more people. Ondo has two parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds decentralized finance tools. Together, they enhance Ondo’s offerings. In a market where trust is key, Ondo partners with firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. They prioritize transparency and legal compliance. Their product, USDY, combines the ease of a stablecoin with yield opportunities. Backed by US Treasuries, it’s a secure option for non-US investors. With many cryptocurrencies being volatile, USDY offers a stable and regulated alternative. Compared to others, its strong backing makes it attractive for those seeking stability and steady returns. Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to change the way we interact with Web3. Built as a layer-1 blockchain, Sui focuses on being secure, powerful, and able to grow. It uses a special object-centric data model and the Move programming language to fix problems found in other blockchains. This means Sui can handle more transactions quickly and safely, making it ready for global use. What sets Sui apart is its focus on the user experience. It removes common barriers that make blockchain hard to use. Features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions make it easier for people to use apps without complicated steps. Programmable transaction blocks let developers create apps that are friendly and easy to use. In a market filled with many coins, Sui stands out because of its strong technology and user-first approach. This makes it an attractive option in today’s market, especially as more people look for blockchain platforms that are both powerful and easy to use. Imagine a blockchain designed just for trading, with speed and security at its core. That’s Sei. It’s the first Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for exchanges, giving them an edge over the competition. Sei can handle a huge number of orders every second, and transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. That’s faster than most other blockchains out there. Plus, it’s backed by big institutions, ensuring it’s secure and reliable. With the potential to grow over 323% by 2030, Sei is catching the eye of many investors. In today’s market, where speed and efficiency are key, Sei stands out. While other coins struggle with slow transaction times, Sei offers a swift and secure alternative. If you’re looking at current trends, where decentralized finance and quick trades are in demand, Sei looks like an attractive option. It’s tailored for the trading world, and that specialization could give it an advantage in the market. Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) faster and more efficient. It introduces its own Layer 1 blockchain, built from scratch to be quick and scalable. One of its standout features is HyperBFT, a special system that helps transactions confirm rapidly while keeping them secure. What’s really exciting is that Hyperliquid offers decentralized perpetual futures trading directly on its platform. Users can trade without paying any gas fees, which are common charges on other networks. Plus, Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book, meaning all trades are visible and verifiable on the blockchain, increasing transparency and trust. In today’s crypto market, platforms that offer speed, low costs, and transparency are highly sought after. Hyperliquid’s approach sets it apart from many other decentralized exchanges that still have issues with high fees and slower transactions. The team behind Hyperliquid comes from top universities and industry leaders, showing strong expertise and innovation. While the crypto market is always changing, Hyperliquid’s focus on solving real problems could make it an attractive option for traders looking for efficient and cost-effective solutions.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months. On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month. Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift. By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin’s fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future. In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders. Although this goes against Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos, it’s undeniably bullish for its price. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin’s market cap to $200T. Some critics warn that Strategy’s debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency’s protocol. Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case. If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin’s scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now. Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency’s coattails, it’s the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin’s growth. What’s more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $25K. The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. Don’t miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here’s a guide on how to buy it. A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it’d be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they’ve taken off is an uphill task. That’s why you’re better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice. $MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone’s opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode. Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI’s newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves. If you buy $MIND today, you’ll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token. Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks. It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It’s currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market. As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come. Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity. They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity’s popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is. Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now. With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC. However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns. Finally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice.

April 28, 2025 10:40 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q1 2025 Hedge Fund Barometer, which showed a significant reversal of pro-growth positions in both U.S. equities and corporate bonds over the quarter as well as an increase in bets on gold. According to Unlimited’s proprietary technology, hedge fund managers came into the year with relatively low conviction and modest views but subsequently ramped up pro-growth positions including long the U.S. dollar, and credit spread and equity bets in line with increased expectations of U.S. growth from the new administration. The majority of those positions were reversed starting in February with the exception of extending bullish positions on gold. “Hedge fund positioning shows some of the lowest conviction in the direction of asset prices that we have seen in decades,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited and portfolio manager of actively-managed ETFs. “Those positions were a dramatic transition from the beginning of the quarter when hedge funds were ramping up their bullish bets on the U.S. economy. The prominence of policy volatility likely triggered managers' reluctance to hold significant directional positions.” Hedge funds eked out modestly positive performance in the first quarter with the mix of sub-strategy returns largely reversing the moves of the previous quarter. Emerging Market funds outperformed meaningfully as Chinese stocks surged meanwhile Equity Long/Short and Event Driven strategies came in weak. 1Q25 Hedge Fund Strategy Performance, Gross of Fees Unlimited’s Hedge Fund Barometer showed other notable moves during the quarter included: Click here to view a video on how Unlimited’s technology works.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Quantum computing has long been announced as “just around the corner,” but several companies are now determined to make this a commercial reality, with the promise of solving complex problems beyond classical computers’ reach. The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Nate Geraci of ETF Store highlighted that GBTC had an implied revenue of $268 million, compared to $211 million from combined collections by the other 11 products. “Nearly 16 months after spot BTC ETFs launched, GBTC still making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined…And it’s not even close.” Source: X After the debut in January 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the heaviest outflows on what analysts linked to investor flight to cheaper alternatives like BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF. Source: Coinglass Before the debut, GBTC held about 619,000 BTC. Sixteen months later, the GBTC’s holdings dropped to 191,000 BTC, a nearly 70% decline in assets under management (AUM). As shown by Geraci’s data, GBTC charged the highest fees of 1.5% while the rest of the products had an average cost of 0.15%-0.94%. Yet GBTC dominated the overall annual revenue. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, GBTC’s 1.5% fee was considered average in the traditional ETF market. However, other analysts pointed out that most investors were captured in GBTC due to the heavy tax implications of switching to a cheaper alternative. Daniel Sempere, a business coach, stated, “Paying the capital gains to switch out of GBTC is more painful than paying the extra fees, I guess.” Simply put, the high fees and captive tax implications boosted GBTC earnings. However, can the expected approval of in-kind redemption for ETFs affect GBTC’s moat? According to experts, in-kind redemption, using BTC instead of cash, would lower the tax burden, especially for large investors. Despite in-kind redemption being tax-efficient, individual investors sitting on massive unrealized gains will still face capital gains tax. That said, GBTC ranked third on the AUM front with $17.8 billion. The BlackRock iShares BTC ETF topped the AUM list with $54.8 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $18 billion. After the slump in Q1 2025, the spot BTC ETFs saw renewed demand in April, with a whopping $3 billion in inflows. This boosted BTC’s recovery to $94k, up 26% from the year’s low of $74.5k. In the short term, the $92K range low support and $100K overhead mid-range resistance were key levels to watch.

Title: The Case for Higher-Ed “Co-Op” Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/28/2025 3:31:01 AM PDT by karpov Like many students, I waited months after graduation before receiving a job offer. Why this delay for many of the nation’s recent graduates? The answer, in part, is that most “entry-level” positions now require candidates to have one to three years of experience. In fact, roughly 61 percent of entry-level job postings now demand at least three years. How is a fresh graduate supposed to gain experience without years-long internships, which many students don’t pursue? A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

Title: Parties involved in CK Hutchison's port transaction must not circumvent review process: China's State Administration for Market Regulation
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/04/mil-250427-globaltimes03.htm

Global Times By Global Times Published: Apr 27, 2025 08:32 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Sunday that it is paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale of its overseas port assets and will conduct a review in accordance with the law, CCTV reported. The regulator emphasized that all parties involved in the transaction must not take any measures to circumvent the review process by any means or implement concentration activities without regulatory approval. Otherwise, legal responsibility will be pursued, CCTV reported. The SAMR's statement came in response to media inquiries following a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on April 16. The WSJ reported that CK Hutchison plans to split its overseas port asset sale into two separate transactions, as a way to advance the deals. According to the WSJ, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is considering carving out two Panamanian ports from the $22.8 billion deal to purchase dozens of terminals from CK Hutchison, citing sources familiar with the matter. MSC has reportedly discussed advancing the majority of the acquisition, which involves 41 port terminals across five continents, while resolving disputes over the two Panamanian ports, the WSJ reported. The deal involves collaboration with US asset manager BlackRock and has been structured into two components with different ownership frameworks: one for the Panama ports and another for the remaining assets. Discussions on the two components are moving in parallel, and separating the Panama ports would ultimately require the parties to reach a new agreement, according to the WSJ. The WSJ further noted that the BlackRock-MSC consortium and Hutchison are currently within a 145-day exclusive negotiation period and have not yet signed final agreements. Prior to the report, a spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of SAMR said on March 28 that it would review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei Media and published on the regulator's official website. On March 31, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to the SAMR's review of the planned port asset sale at a press briefing, stressing that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries' legitimate rights and interests.

GBTC is still "making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined..." Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, stated on X on Sunday. "And it's not even close." The fund generates approximately $268.5 million in annual revenue, with a 1.5% expense ratio applied to $17.9 billion in assets under management, according to Coinglass data. All the other U.S.-Bitcoin ETFs shown by Geraci generate an implied annual revenue of a little over $211.8 million from a total of $89 billion in assets under management. GBTC's revenue dominance persists despite losing more than half its holdings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January 2024, revealing how fee structures have shaped the fund's economics, regardless of market share. Aside from its first-mover advantage and brand recognition, Grayscale's control over GBTC's management allows it to charge a 1.5% fee. For example, BlackRock's IBIT holds three times more assets, at $56 billion, compared to GBTC's $18 billion, but it generates only about $137 million in revenue with its 0.25% fee. In response, Grayscale launched its Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) in March 2025 primarily to offer a lower-cost alternative to GBTC’s fee, while also diversifying its product lineup amid intensifying competition. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment in 2013 as a private trust, before offering an ETF in January of last year, alongside several other ETF issuers. All this rolled into place after Grayscale won a landmark case against the then-Gensler-led SEC to convert its trust to an ETF. When a trust converts to an ETF, key aspects of its structure change. From a closed-end form, it becomes open-ended, allowing shares to be redeemed based on demand. Because their distribution and transaction costs are different and often lower, the expense ratios for ETFs have been "historically less than those for corresponding mutual funds," the SEC explains. As such, ETFs "can be more tax efficient" because ETF shares are generally redeemable "in-kind," the SEC notes. In April last year, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein claimed that the fees "will come down" as the ETF market matures. The largest single-day outflow for GBTC was recorded on March 19, 2024, totaling $618 million, according to CoinGlass data. At this pace, it could run out of Bitcoin by July 8, though James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Decrypt that its outflows would "slow from here."

Charlie O’Donovan took home the top prize with his landscape photograph “The Race” The Race by Charlie O'Donovan won top prize. Photo: Charlie O'Donovan Charlie O'Donovan being presented with his prize by Ita Hegarty, President of the Irish Photographic Federation. Photo: Arthur Carron Charlie O'Donovan receives his award A photo of rowers racing on Cork’s River Lee has taken top prize at this year’s Irish Photographic Federation’s national competition. Arthur Carron, council member of the Irish Photographic Competition, said the competition is an opportunity for beginners to “help develop their craft”. Charlie O’Donovan, of Cork Camera Group, won Image of the Year with his photo of the rowers in front of Blackrock Castle, titled “The Race”. Virtual beginners have entered and done very well According to Mr Carron, it’s important for photographers to focus on capturing what they enjoy. He said: “Lots of people like capturing seascapes or people. Photograph what interests you, that’s how you’ll succeed in the competition. “Virtual beginners have entered and done very well for themselves. The competition can help people develop their craft, it’s an inclusive, enjoyable experience. I would encourage people to get involved in their local camera club and give it a go.” Charlie O'Donovan being presented with his prize by Ita Hegarty, President of the Irish Photographic Federation. Photo: Arthur Carron Mr Carron took home a second-place prize in the people section for his photo of an older man and a horse. The federation aims to help Irish photographers “advance the standard of their photography”. Along with running its annual championships, the organisation also hosts lecture tours by international photographers. Its annual national competition, which has been running for over 30 years, is an all-Ireland event, with regional qualifiers in the north-east, mid-east, mid-west and in the south run by the Southern Association of Camera Clubs. The competition requires entrants to be a member of a camera club, with the overall winner chosen from gold medal winners of each of its six categories: people, landscape, creative, activity, macro and urban. Popular categories in the last number of years include portrait and landscape. There were 1,600 entries to the qualifying rounds, with 700 entries in the final round held at the Westgrove Hotel in Clane, Co Kildare, and judged by members Gabriel O’Shaughnessy, John Mischelly and Ann Cassidy. Overall winner Mr O’Donovan took home €1,600 to spend on new camera gear at Bermingham Cameras, Dublin. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Yo, what’s good, crypto fam? It’s your boy Eric Kim, droppin’ the hottest Bitcoin news straight from the X streets, April 28, 2025. Let’s cut through the noise and get to the real talk—Bitcoin’s makin’ moves, and the vibe is straight-up electric. Here’s the top scoop, served with that Kim swagger. 1. Bitcoin ETFs Are Eatin’ Good, Fam! Aight, check this: Bitcoin ETFs are out here flexin’ like nobody’s business. Word on X is that Ark 21Shares scooped up 1,360 BTC worth $116.1 milly on April 21, while ARK Invest dropped a cool $267 milly on Bitcoin. BlackRock? They ain’t slouchin’ either—$84 milly for their spot ETF. That’s big money movin’, y’all, and it’s got the market buzzin’. Posts from @Cointelegraph and @BitcoinMagazine are straight-up hyped, sayin’ this institutional cash is pushin’ Bitcoin toward new highs. With BTC sittin’ pretty at $94K, you know the bulls are runnin’ wild. Eric’s Take: Yo, this ain’t no retail FOMO—this is Wall Street suits stackin’ sats like it’s their day job. When the big dogs like BlackRock and ARK are goin’ all-in, you know Bitcoin’s about to pop off. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause this could send us to the moon, fr. 2. Senator McCormick’s Stackin’ BTC, No Cap Hold up, we got a US Senator in the game now! @unusual_whales and @BitcoinMagazine dropped the tea that Senator Dave McCormick copped up to $250K in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF. A politician bettin’ on BTC? That’s wild, fam. X is lit with folks sayin’ this could mean friendlier crypto laws down the road. If the suits in DC are hodlin’, you know Bitcoin’s gettin’ that mainstream glow-up. Eric’s Take: A senator stackin’ sats is straight-up bullish. This ain’t just about one dude’s portfolio—it’s a signal that crypto’s creepin’ into the Capitol. If more politicians jump on the Bitcoin train, we might see some real policy moves. Big W for the crypto crew. 3. Price Predictions Got Us Dreamin’ of Lambos X is poppin’ with price predictions, and they’re lookin’ juicy. @Vivek4real_ is hypin’ Bitwise’s call that Bitcoin could hit $200K, especially if countries start scoopin’ it up. @AltcoinDailyio’s teasin’ a video with end-of-2025 price targets, and you know it’s gonna be wild. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the OG, droppin’ bars on @BitcoinMagazine, sayin’ BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gonna be the biggest ETF in a decade. With BTC at $94K and that cup-and-handle pattern poppin’ off (@Bitcoinmeraklsi), the chart nerds are losin’ it. Eric’s Take: $200K? Bruh, I’m already picturin’ the Lambo. But for real, these predictions ain’t just hype—big players are backin’ it with cash. Saylor’s callin’ it like he sees it, and when institutions and charts align, you better strap in. We might be lookin’ at six figures real soon. 4. Whales and Institutions Runnin’ the Show Here’s the tea from @HHorsley: Bitcoin’s at $94K, but Google searches for it are mad low. What’s that mean? Retail ain’t drivin’ this pump—it’s the whales and institutions, baby. @whale_alert caught a fat 564 BTC ($53 milly) movin’ from Antpool to Binance, and @Bitcoinmeraklsi’s talkin’ big transfers too. X is sayin’ the big boys are buyin’ while the crowd’s still sleepin’. Eric’s Take: Yo, when the whales are feastin’ and retail’s snoozin’, that’s when you know the smart money’s movin’. These dudes are stackin’ like it’s a cheat code. If you ain’t payin’ attention, you’re missin’ the wave. Time to wake up and get in the game. 5. CZ Droppin’ Truth Bombs on the Ecosystem My man Changpeng Zhao (CZ) got X shook with some real talk. @erhanunall posted that CZ’s sayin’ this bull run is all about Bitcoin ‘cause of them ETFs, but the altcoin season’s gotta pop off for the whole crypto ecosystem to thrive. That’s got folks on X debatin’ whether BTC’s hoggin’ the spotlight or settin’ the stage for the alts. Eric’s Take: CZ’s spittin’ facts. Bitcoin’s the king, no doubt, but the alts need some love too. If we get that altcoin pump, the whole crypto space is gonna be eatin’. Keep an eye on them smaller coins, ‘cause they might be the next to moon. Why This Matters, Fam This ain’t just news—it’s the pulse of the crypto game right now. Bitcoin’s flexin’ with ETF money, political clout, and whale moves, all while the X community’s hypin’ it to the stars. The sentiment? Bullish AF. But don’t get it twisted—@HHorsley’s point about low retail vibes means this is the calm before the storm. When the crowd catches up, it’s gonna be a whole vibe. Eric’s Final Word: Yo, Bitcoin’s out here makin’ power plays while the world’s still tryna catch up. Whether it’s senators, ETFs, or Saylor’s big bets, the game’s changin’. Stack them sats, stay humble, and don’t sleep on this wave. We in the future, fam—let’s ride it. Peace! Key Citations Note: This is written in the energetic, conversational style of Eric Kim, inspired by his YouTube vibe—hype, relatable, and a bit braggadocious, but always keepin’ it real with the crypto community.

For instance, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF bought 1,360 BTC worth $116.1 million on April 21, 2025, while ARK Invest purchased Bitcoin worth $267 million, and BlackRock acquired $84 million worth for its spot ETF. These moves highlight growing institutional interest, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price upward. Institutional and Political Interest The involvement of political figures is also noteworthy. US Senator Dave McCormick invested up to $250,000 in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF, suggesting increasing acceptance among policymakers. This could have implications for future regulations and policies affecting Bitcoin. Market Sentiment and Price Predictions Bitcoin is currently trading around $94,000, with analysts predicting it could reach $200,000 or higher, driven by institutional demand and potential country-level adoption. Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, predicted that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF could become the world’s largest ETF within a decade, emphasizing Bitcoin’s long-term potential in traditional finance. Market Dynamics Despite the high price, research suggests retail interest is low, with Google searches for “Bitcoin” near long-term lows.

Title: Google Declared An Illegal Monopoly For The Second Time In A Year, Digital Ad Network Under Fire

Google's ad services are an illegal monopoly, according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema. The decision, which was handed down April 17, is the second antitrust ruling against the company in the last year. In her opinion, the judge ruled that the company's ad business, which matches website publishers with advertisers and determines which banner ads appear on which sites across the web, has violated antitrust law. Don't Miss: "For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets," Brinkema wrote in her 115-page ruling. Continuing, "Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anti-competitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features." According to the Associated Press, the construction of the monopolizing ad system began back in 2008, when Google bought online ad specialist DoubleClick for $3.2 billion. At the time, U.S. regulators approved the purchase. Now, they've realized that move enabled the company to manipulate ad prices. The Justice Department argued that Google controls all three corners of the digital ad market— one side that allows website publishers to sell ad space on their websites, the other is the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of viewers, and the third is the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions that connect buyers and sellers. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective," Lee-Anne Mulholand, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, the media reports. According to the AP, the company's lawyers argued that the government is basing its case on antiquated concepts that were relevant a decade ago, but are no longer a good framework for understanding the highly competitive market for advertising that exists currently. The decision marks the Justice Department's second victory over the tech giant in a year. Last August, US District Judge Amit Mehta, ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly on search. In that ruling, the judge said that the company's exclusive contracts, which secured them the spot as the No. 1 search engine on smartphones and web browsers, violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. And back in 2023, a federal jury found the Google app store to be an illegal monopoly. The cases are expected to play out over the next several years as Google appeals the decisions.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) – China’s top market regulator said on Sunday it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s 0001.HK planned sale of most of its ports operations to a BlackRock-led consortium and parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. The sale by the Hong Kong conglomerate, which contains two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized amid intensifying U.S.-Sino trade tensions. “No concentration of undertakings shall be implemented without approval, otherwise legal liability will be incurred,” the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The statement was in response to a Wall Street Journal article on April 16. The MSC shipping empire, which is part of the BlackRock consortium, has held discussions on moving ahead with the bulk of the deal while disputes over the two Panama ports are resolved, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal has two components with different ownership structures – one for the Panama ports and one for everything else, the report added. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take back the Panama Canal and has hailed the deal as a “reclaiming” of the waterway. Chinese state media, however, have criticized the planned sale as a betrayal of China’s interests. Trump said on Saturday that American military and commercial ships should be allowed to travel through the Panama Canal and Suez Canal free of charge. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison announced last month it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $22.8 billion. Singapore’s PSA International, which owns the other 20%, is also exploring a sale of its holding, sources have said. Overall the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal.

Title: Defunding DEI: Here’s how the Trump administration has undone Biden’s very prized programs

Ohio State Sen. Jerry Cirino weighs in on Democratic opposition on the Buckeye State banning DEI practices at public colleges. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden’s efforts. The president, just hours after taking the Oath of Office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government. He also quickly signed an order making it "the official policy of the U.S. government to only recognize two genders: male and female." WHITE HOUSE OPM ORDERS ALL DEI OFFICES TO BEGIN CLOSING BY END OF DAY WEDNESDAY A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) That move quickly forced those offices to take down all outward facing media — websites, social media accounts, and more — for those DEI offices, and required the withdrawal of any final pending documents, directives, orders, materials and equity plans. Trump also canceled current and impending contracts focused on DEI initiatives, with Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that move saved the federal government $420 million. The president also issued two other executive actions that day targeting DEI. One was an executive order to end discrimination in the workplace and higher education through race and sex-based preferences under the guise of DEI. The other was a memo to eliminate a Biden administration policy that prioritized DEI hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration. In the memo rolling back Biden's DEI hiring practices at the FAA, Trump ordered the secretary of transportation and FAA administrator to immediately stop Biden's DEI hiring programs and return to nondiscriminatory, merit-based hiring. TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS Trump also required that the FAA administrator review the past performance and performance standards of all agency employees in critical safety positions and make it clear that anyone who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure flight safety and efficiency. A sign marks the entrance to the FAA headquarters in Washington DC on October 7, 2024. (J. David Ake/Getty Images) "Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence," the memo read. The memo stated: "All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication." Trump also rescinded Biden’s order on diversity initiatives, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government," which he signed on his first day in office in 2021. In February, the Department of Education also warned state education departments that they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. That move came after Trump signed executive orders directing agencies to provide a plan to eliminate federal funding for "illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. A new study revealed that nearly half of U.S. college students don't DEI courses mandated in their schools. (Fox News) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency’s "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of Biden’s term, to peel back any DEI requirements. That Biden-era policy said that DEI was an "integral" part of "the entire scientific process," and pushed NIH's chief scientist and top scientific integrity official to "promote agency efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion." It also instituted agency-wide policy directives ordering supervisors at the NIH to "support" scientists and researchers who are "asexual" or "intersex," while imploring NIH leadership to "confer with relevant offices" when additional DEI expertise is needed. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI "The Biden administration weaponized NIH’s scientific integrity policy to inject harmful DEI and gender ideology into research," said Health and Human Services Department spokesperson, Andrew Nixon. "Rescinding this (scientific integrity) policy will allow NIH to restore science to its golden standard and protect the integrity of science." The Biden administration also funded grants related to DEI, such as one for roughly $165,000 that was focused on "queering the curriculum" for family medicine doctors to guide them in their treatment of transgender patients. Those grants have been canceled. And earlier this week, multiple federal agencies told Fox News Digital that they have dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services over the business social network’s embrace of DEI. The Departments of Treasury, Interior and Veterans Affairs dropped LinkedIn — a move to comply with the president’s executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "Every American taxpayer should be angry that the Biden administration wasted so much money on contracts like these," an Interior Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "Under the leadership of President Trump, we have been combing through hundreds of thousands of contracts here at the Department alone and are canceling wasteful, woke, and downright ridiculous contracts that do not align with the will of the American people." LinkedIn DEI services (LinkedIn) A LinkedIn spokesperson told Fox News Digital, in response, that: "Like every business, the organizations that use our products change, often driven by shifts in their budgets and priorities.

Title: My Stock Market Abundance Plan

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted April 27, 2025 by Ben Carlson I liked Abundance by Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein because the theme of the book is about doing stuff rather than scarcity. The big ideas from the book revolve around the fact that there’s too much red tape when it comes to things like housing, energy, healthcare and technology development. If nothing else, the idea of making it easier to build more housing is something I’m completely on board with. But there was one area of the book that was lacking — the stock market. I thought I could help these guys out and give them the Ben Carlson Stock Market Abundance Plan. Here’s the deal: Roughly 60% of American households own stocks but the top 10% owns 87% of the market. We need more people involved in the stock market. I have a two-part plan to make this happen. Just half of all Americans have savings in a retirement plan such as a 401k. We need to fix that. The Thrift Savings Plan is the defined-contribution retirement plan for federal government employees. It’s the best 401k plan there is. There are just five individual fund options, all extremely low-cost1 index funds — U.S. large cap, U.S. small cap, international, aggregate bond, and U.S. treasuries. Plus they have targedate funds made up of these fund options. The funds are managed by BlackRock and State Street. Why is this plan only available to government employees? It should be open to anyone with a job. Many employees have no access to a 401k. Part one of my abundance plan is that anyone who earns a paycheck and pays taxes has the ability to access the TSP retirement plan. In fact, you should be auto-enrolled and forced to opt out of the plan if you don’t wish to contribute. Part two of my plan involves a little more long-term thinking. I want $10,000 from the government into a Roth IRA account for every child born in America today. Don’t worry — there are stipulations on this account. It has to go into the stock market or a targetdate fund. You can’t touch it until age 21. And you can only take the money out at that age to pay for things like student loans, a down payment on a house or to start a business. Otherwise you have to let it ride in the market. After 21 years at 8% growth, $10k turns into $50k. Over 30 years, $10k turns into $100k. Just think about how helpful that would be to young people trying to get their footing in life. It would ease the burden on parents. It would allow young people to take more risks. It would make it easier for them to start a life after school. Would it be expensive? Yeah but it’s an investment in our future. Are there things I haven’t accounted for in my analysis? Sure. But I don’t want the stock market to be just a place for the upper echelon of society. The top 1% owns 50% of the stock market. The bottom 50% owns 1% of the stock market. We should make it easier for more people to save for retirement and invest in the stock market. That’s my abundance plan. Michael and I spoke to Derek about the book, how it relates to the current environment, trade wars and more: ﻿ Podcast version here: 1The small cap fund costs 5 basis points.

Title: The implications of Trump’s big bet on tariffs
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/politics/tariffs-trump-trade-war/index.html
Time Published: 2025-04-27T12:12:40Z
Full Content:
Editor’s Note: President Donald Trump’s massive wager on tariffs with your money came together over years. It took just days to fall apart. This is Part 4 of an in-depth, contemporaneous look at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. When the stock market started chewing through retirement accounts like a wheat thresher, business owners began howling about the risk of ruination, and economic analysts commenced clanging warning bells of a possible worldwide recession, many political watchers thought surely President Donald Trump would take notice. They were certain he would finally see the existential danger of slapping punishing tariffs on scores of countries and step back from his potentially catastrophic plan. Instead, in the 10th week of his new term, the 47th president is leaning into his latest favorite metaphor: that international trade is a high-stakes card game and he is the master strategist. Only he knows which countries hold a strong hand, which do not, and how bets should be placed. And he is laying down a massive wager. “For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he proclaims to an adoring crowd of Republican VIPs. They have assembled at the White House to celebrate what he calls his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Up at the podium, Trump gleefully displays a chart thick with numbers purporting to show just how much each country will pony up for access to the great American marketplace. But experts who have played the trade game much longer quickly call Trump’s big move on the second day of April a fool’s bet — one that could poison US trade relations with those friendly partners he mentioned and open the door for less friendly competitors to capitalize on his misstep. Skeptics say Trump is flirting with the kind of failure that can unwind a presidency. Trump meets their warnings with a jutted jaw and declarations that he will not blink. To understand how Trump came so quickly to such a perilous spot after much talk, many threats and occasional applications of tariffs in much smaller degrees, it’s worth considering what those close to him have said for years. He truly believes the ability to tax imported goods is a near-mythical power to wipe away trade deficits, stop illegal immigration, control trafficking in illicit drugs, and make the world bow to his will. Aside from military force, he seems to see tariffs as the most direct way a president can rule over not just the United States, but everyone, everywhere. “I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said back on Inauguration Day just as he had on the campaign trail, “because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.” It’s an intriguing claim considering how little good came out of his initial tilt with tariffs. Over the four years of Trump’s first term, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping took turns levying tariffs on pork, solar panels, steel pipes, fruit, nuts, intellectual property, recycled aluminum and more. They eventually worked out an agreement, satisfying Trump’s need to declare himself the master negotiator. But subsequent studies found the promise he extracted for China to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods and services went almost entirely unfulfilled. President Joe Biden maintained those tariffs, but as a practical matter, Trump’s first trade war ended in a draw. Still, this time around Team Trump insists it is making a bigger, longer play. By squeezing world markets simultaneously, the US will drive other countries away from their protectionist tendencies. Better trade balances will follow. Jobs that once moved away from America to find cheaper labor will come back to avoid higher import fees. Gleaming new factories will spring up like wildflowers. Trump will triumph. “Remember the armies of millions of millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones? That kind of thing is going to come to America!” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” raising the specter of factories full of laborers as a grand vision for the future. But then Lutnick clarifies: Any modern factories will undoubtedly include massive amounts of automation. He’s talking about other, better jobs for the people he says will benefit from Trump’s big tariff gamble. “High school-educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.” For many economists, labor analysts and technology specialists, it is a laughably far-fetched idea. Even if tariffs can offset some of the lower wages elsewhere, big investments in big properties — such as manufacturing plants — take years, even if investors are fully confident in the political stability of the host nation. What’s more, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden had already boosted American manufacturing jobs to higher levels than Trump ever saw in his first term. Indeed, 20% of domestic factories that are underproducing say a shortage of workers is to blame. By 2033, some researchers say more than half of all new manufacturing jobs in the US could be unfilled. CNN’s Matt Egan, one of the most astute economic reporters around, spoke to a former Ford executive and came away with a cautionary tale. Even that giant of American auto production “had trouble finding qualified workers to work in their assembly plants,” Egan says. And some of those they did find? “They ended up quitting because they didn’t realize just how difficult the job would be.” In a broad sense, Trump is right to say many of America’s once-thriving, old-fashioned factory towns descended into dust and decay in part because other countries used tariffs to protect their manufacturing industries. Some statistics show that most of America’s big trading partners have higher import fees, making US goods more costly and putting US exporters at a disadvantage. But there is precious little evidence to support Trump’s notion that America’s future economic glory will come from pushing its citizens back to assembly lines that, based on his descriptions, often sound like the kind of heavy production of the post-World War II years. And make no mistake: Despite everything Trump says, foreign nations will not pay all these tariffs. Instead, economic analysts overwhelmingly say American consumers will foot most of the monumental bill for what those experts call Trump’s taxes. Perhaps it should be no surprise then, that within days of Trump’s “Liberation” event, even nominal friends who supported him in the election are skimming wild cards toward the president’s carefully stacked tariff deck. “We’ve got to become friends with Canada again,” Joe Rogan says on one of the most popular podcasts in the world with millions of listeners per episode. “I can’t believe that there is anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. This is the dumbest f**king feud.” “The idea that this is good and makes the American economy inherently stronger is wrongheaded,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro says to his own vast audience. “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public or congressional input.” Estimates start appearing in the news about cars costing thousands of dollars more; the price of televisions, bananas, clothing, computers and sporting goods skyrocketing. Considering that voters’ anger over inflation helped propel Trump back to the White House, the idea that he would risk driving prices into the stratosphere with such a big, early move is alarming to even some GOP lawmakers. “High prices are obviously something no one wants to pay — I understand the concern they have,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, tells CNN while nodding to the hope that other countries might cave to Trump’s demands before the worst hits the home front. On the Democratic side, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky says the damage is already being done by Trump’s weeks of threatening tariffs, imposing them, then pausing them. “It’s the uncertainty,” McGarvey says. “It’s the on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again. … Our phones are ringing off the hook right now. People see their 401(k)s, they see their college funds for their kids just cratering.” CNN’s Jamie Gangel sees lawmakers of all stripes looking at the days and weeks ahead and quaking. “They don’t know what Donald Trump is going to wake up and decide.” The Yale Budget Lab says Trump’s tariffs will raise costs for the average American family by $3,800 annually. Some analysts picking apart how the administration calculated those retaliatory tariff rates noted the tariff formula released by the White House seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a formula generated by ChatGPT. As if to underscore the administration’s seemingly slapdash approach, the Trump plan is found to include a 10% tariff on some Antarctic islands where there are no people. Only penguins. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump in the election, posts his concerns online. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war,” Ackman writes, “we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country.” The metric for fear on Wall Street (there really is such a thing) is pegging at levels not seen since Covid-19 shattered global supply chains. The stock market is splashing red across newscasts, showing $6 trillion in lost value over a week. Respected financial institutions are putting the odds of a recession well above 50%. Even Elon Musk takes an apparent swing at Trump’s call for a 20% tariff on Europe. The richest man in the world — and a top adviser to the president — tells a right-wing political conference in Italy he’d like to see a “zero tax situation … a free trade zone between Europe and North America.” A chief architect and defender of Trump’s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, suggests Musk is trying to protect his electric car business. The Tesla CEO calls Navarro a “moron … dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk will later apologize — to bricks. “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” the president posts on Truth Social, pushing for a rally. At a fundraiser for congressional Republicans, he insists the White House is being flooded with messages from abroad. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” Trump says, implying that his refusal to give an inch is paying off, as Republican lawmakers keep praising his steel spine. “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” the leader of the free world says as if he is about to lay his winning hand on the table Less than 24 hours later, he folds. The president imposes a 90-day suspension for many of the tariffs he had declared nonnegotiable. It happens so suddenly that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is testifying in a congressional hearing when he hears about the new strategy. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, rips into the White House witness for claiming to know what was happening — and then seeming just as surprised as everyone else. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” Horsford shouts. “There is no strategy! This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop!” Amid reports that an alarming shift in the bond market — a key pillar of US economic power — is what made Trump retreat, the president’s team insists he did not buckle at all. Although many were praising him hours earlier for refusing to budge on his tariff demands, they are now crowing about his wily genius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this was Trump’s “strategy all along.” Brilliant. The ultimate dealmaker. The praise is unending among Republicans, and the financial markets come surging back for their best day in 16 years. Trump declares victory. In the cold light of morning, reality returns. Commentators outside the MAGA echo sphere start saying all Trump did was push the world dangerously close to an economic disaster and then proclaim himself a hero for backing away from the calamity he created. The prediction of the Yale Budget Lab adjusts upward — now placing the annual tariff tax on families at $4,700. To make matters worse, some analysts say Trump’s brash bet substantially weakened the faith of other nations in the reliability of the US government. “Biggest winner is China. Hands down.” On the “Pivot” podcast, which scrutinizes the intersection of business, tech and politics, entrepreneur and New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway pulls no punches. “Every Chinese diplomat and businessman … they’re all working overtime and they’re going to European capitals; they’re going everywhere … and they are saying, ‘You may not agree with us, but you know what? We’re good partners.’” Analysts note, through all the ups and downs, the financial markets have still not returned to Inauguration Day levels when all of Trump’s tariff talk was still theory. What’s more, a social media post from Trump saying “this is a great time to buy” a few hours before his about-face brings accusations of illegal insider trading, to which the White House accuses Democrats of playing “partisan games.” In addition, when it becomes clear how many tariffs have not been suspended, and how China is now facing at least a whopping 145% fee to send goods into the US, the markets nosedive again. China calls Trump’s policies a “joke,” strikes back with its own 125% tariff on US goods, and financial experts refuse to lower their predictions of a possible recession. Indeed, Larry Fink, the CEO of the gargantuan, global investment company BlackRock, says on CNBC in mid-April, “I think we are very close, if not in a recession now.” Trump says he’s waiting on a call from China to discuss some sort of deal, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” But it appears they don’t — at least not at the levels they did when voters put him back into office. A University of Michigan study, taken before the tariff uproar, is released and shows consumer sentiment at its second lowest level since 1952 with fears of inflation charging upward. Farmers go back to worrying about what will happen to overseas sales of their crops. Businesspeople return to fretting about rising costs and ebbing sales. Working families brace for it all to come crashing down on their bank accounts. Less than one hundred days into his second turn at the presidency, Donald Trump has bet the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Americans on his deep affection for tariffs. He has started the most significant trade war in generations. It is not clear whether he can end it. CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Shatter $2,780,000,000 in Net Inflows in Just Seven Days, According to Lookonchain

Full Content:
A prominent on-chain analytics firm says the 10 largest Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed massive inflows over the past week as BTC surged above $90,000. On the social media platform X, Lookonchain says the Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of 29,321 BTC worth $2.78 billion in just seven days. Net inflows refer to the number of coins entering an ETF minus outflows or coins leaving the investment vehicle.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this week as traders bet on a recovery of so-called risk assets and ... More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: It’s Time To Buy Muni Bond Funds—Here’s Why And Where

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. Bad news: This is a treacherous field. It is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. For tax-sheltered accounts like IRAs, munis are inappropriate; there, use this survey of taxable bonds and bond funds. For taxable accounts, munis are a buy. Says Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in ten years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early (see rule #3 below), but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. What about that talk of making interest on all state and municipal debt federally taxable (for the first time)? Haskell: “Am I threatened? No.” If this happens, he says, existing bonds will be grandfathered. And if the wise people in Congress decree that henceforth states and cities can issue only taxable debt, his job is not over. The same sewers and school buildings would have to be financed, and the clientele for the bonds would expand to include investors who don’t touch them now, like foreigners and endowment funds. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. This fund survey aims to make the investment easy. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: We narrow the roster of those worth looking at to 40. First, exchange-traded funds, the newer kind of fund that until recently had scarcely anything to offer to muni investors. Here’s a list of 24 of them. These ETFs have annual expense burdens no higher than 0.18%. They each average a daily trading volume of at least $1 million, meaning that you can probably get in and out without getting eaten alive by the bid/ask spread: The older style of fund is a mutual fund. No-load mutuals impose no trading costs but tend to have higher expense ratios. Alas, the subset of municipal-bond mutuals with bargain expense ratios is tiny. All of the funds shown here come from Vanguard. Note: Where Vanguard has both a small-stakes share class starting at $3,000 and a large-stakes version for buyers putting in $50,000, the table displays only the latter. There are two problems with individual tax-exempt bonds. One is that they are hard to research. The IOU you thought was backed by a city or state may in fact be backed only by the revenue from a decrepit nursing home. Do you really want to spend your free time reading fine print? The other matter is that muni bonds are hard to trade. You were perhaps planning to hold until redemption, but things happen. You might need to raise cash. Or you might want to take a tax loss during a spike in interest rates. To get an idea of what befalls small investors trying to sell, take a look at the bond offerings on your brokerage platform. How many are listed as available for sale but with no quote on the bid side? A blank spot for the bid is an indication that, if you need to unload in a hurry, you will get hosed by a middleman. Cashing out a muni fund, in contrast, is easy. To swap for a tax loss, find a substitute fund that isn’t exactly the same. Example: Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index behaves much like iShares National Muni Bond but is sufficiently different that the IRS can’t call the swap a wash. After 31 days you can go back where you were, if you want to. It’s easy to find a well-managed fund costing an annual 0.1% or less. It might make sense to pay a little more to get what you want in duration (rate risk) or timing (as with those target-date funds). But not a lot more. Don’t be led astray by the double-tax-free allure of a fund holding only home-state bonds. State income tax rates are usually less than 10%, and muni yields about 4%. There is, that is, not a lot of state tax to be avoided. Kentucky’s flat tax rate is 4%, so the most that a rational Kentucky resident would pay in incremental cost to avoid local tax is 4% of 4%, or 0.16%. How curious that holders of the class C shares of the Nuveen Kentucky Municipal Bond fund pay 1.93% in annual fees, 64 times what they’d pay to hold a muni bond index ETF from Vanguard. Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary, has another 24 single-state funds on offer for the mathematically challenged. Simple rule of thumb: If Vanguard has a single-state fund for your state, buy it. If Vanguard doesn’t, buy a national fund. The customary practice for a state or city borrowing money is to offer a fairly high coupon on a bond due in 30 years, while reserving the right to call the bond in early beginning in 10 years. For the bond issuer this arrangement is rather nice. For the bond buyer it’s awful. It turns the investment into a heads-you-break-even, tails-you-lose proposition. If interest rates go down, the issuer calls in the bond. That is, the buyer has the good coupon for only 10 years. If rates go up, the issuer stands pat, leaving the buyer stuck for another 20 years at a below-market yield. This unwanted 20-year bond will trade at a discount. The lopsided set of possible outcomes makes quite a contrast to the bet on a noncallable 30-year Treasury bond. Long Treasuries are risky, but the risk is symmetric. They fall in value if interest rates climb, but they are just as likely to rise in value as interest rates go down. Muni owners should be cognizant that they have made asymmetric bets on interest rates. In other words: Muni bond yields overstate expected returns. By how much? To properly answer that question you need to assess, using each bond’s coupon, call date and maturity date, the effect of 10,000 possible paths that interest rates might take between now and 2055, and assign a probability to each path. Such a calculation would be a bit impractical. But you can get a sense of how harmful call provisions are by observing how much compensation investors demand for putting up with them. For AAA-rated munis the yield curve (2 years out versus 30 years) is 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, steeper than the yield curve for Treasuries. A portfolio of long-dated callable bonds has embedded in it some appreciable fraction of that 50 basis points as an expected loss from rate volatility. The following table of net yields aims to deliver rough justice to the situation. It debits the officially reported yields on long-term muni funds for an estimate of call damage. Taxes are allowed for, as well, at different income levels, in two high-tax states. Conclusion: For people in moderately high or very high tax brackets, municipal debt is usually more rewarding than Treasury debt. It’s just not quite as good a deal as bond salesmen would have you believe. The 22% federal bracket, which starts at $96,950 of taxable income on a joint return, is where muni bond interest begins to beat out Treasury bond interest. In the next bracket up, 24%, most couples are also paying a 3.8% investment tax, for a combined federal rate of 27.8%. What about the alternative minimum tax? This affliction largely evaporated with the passage of the 2017 tax law. If the problem reappears, which would happen if Congress fails to extend that law, AMT is still likely to matter only in money-market muni funds and in high-yield muni funds. In short, it’s not worth paying extra fees to get a fund labeled “AMT-free.” State rates, which never apply to U.S. Treasury interest and usually but not always apply to interest on out-of-state municipal bonds, range from 0% to 14.8%. Two states with stiff taxes, New York and California, are home to low-fee double-tax-free funds. New York bonds have pretty good yields. California yields, however, are not terrific and investors there are often better off buying a national muni fund. A peculiarity of the tax code gives fund investors an advantage over bond investors. Say a bond comes out at par and sinks to 90 cents on the dollar as rates rise. If you buy at 90 and redeem at 100, the 10-point gain is taxed as ordinary income (which is totally unfair). Now let’s say a fund buys bonds at 100 and, as interest rates rise, the bonds fall in price to 90 and the fund shares fall in price from $100 to $90. You buy the fund at $90 and see its shares gradually recover as its bonds mature and get cashed out at par. You now sell the fund at $100. Your $10 gain is taxed at the lower capital gain rate.

Title: Trade-war panic is so overblown that it's a great time to buy, these Wall Street strategists say

Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation. It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market. However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets. Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market. To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further. "Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh," Levine told BI. "The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios." Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession. Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up. "There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here," Levine said. DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view. "Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive," DeSpirito told BI. Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies. "In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property," DeSpirito said. "A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming." DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon. "In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side," DeSpirito said. Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the "sell America" narrative is overblown. Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap. "This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that," Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector. "Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come," Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven. It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said. "In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years," Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze. "This is a great opportunity to be dollar-cost averaging into the weakness that we've seen," Schulze said. "A lot of negativity has been priced in a short period of time for US equities, and I don't see any structural excesses in the economy that would cause a deep recession." Jump to

Tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Amid the booming tokenized real-world asset market, it appears that only a few major players are controlling the overall market. According to data from the real-world asset platform rwa.xyz, tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Tokenized U.S. treasuries on the blockchain were valued at $4.01 billion in January 2025. Since then, their value has surged by 53.62%, reaching $6.16 billion. This sharp increase highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in blockchain as a tool for modernizing fixed-income markets. The data also reveals that six entities—BlackRock BUIDL, Franklin Templeton BENJI, Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, Circle USYC, and Ondo OUSG—control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries. BlackRock’s BUIDL, representing the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, has emerged as the industry leader in blockchain-based U.S. treasuries. It holds a market capitalization of $2.5 billion, making it 360% larger than the next biggest fund. The other top contenders are: Collectively, these six funds control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries issued, underscoring their dominance in the space.

Title: BTC Price Action Tightens: Market In Consolidation Phase Ahead Of A Potential Break

This week, markets across the board have remained relatively calm, with price action reflecting a clear consolidation phase. The Nasdaq, for instance, has formed an inside bar on the weekly chart, meaning the current candle is trading within the high and low of last week's range. This often signals indecision or a buildup before a larger move. Bitcoin is following a similar pattern. After several weeks of upward movement, the cryptocurrency has entered a tight trading range, consolidating just below key resistance levels. This type of price behavior typically precedes a breakout, and the direction of that breakout could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Don't Miss: Weekly Analysis: Bitcoin Trading Within a Defined Range On the higher timeframe, Bitcoin remains locked within a clear weekly range. Earlier this week, it dipped below the swing low from March 10, capturing liquidity beneath that level before bouncing back. This kind of price action suggests that buyers are still active and willing to step in at lower prices. However, Bitcoin has not yet pushed through the key range high near 88,742. This level has now acted as resistance twice, reinforcing its importance. If price returns to this area, how it reacts will be crucial. A clean break above it could open the door to a move toward the 92,000s and possibly set the stage for a run toward all-time highs. On the other hand, another rejection could mark the formation of a local top and increase the chances of a deeper pullback. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Key Levels and Market Scenarios to Watch As of now, Bitcoin is holding above 83,000, showing signs of strength despite the consolidation. If it continues to trade above this level and gains momentum, the next upside targets to monitor are 88,000 and then the 92,000s. These levels will be essential in determining whether the current consolidation leads to continuation or reversal. Should Bitcoin break below 83,000 with conviction, particularly on daily closes, a move down toward the low 80,000s becomes likely. If that support fails to hold, price could revisit the mid-74,000s, an area of previous consolidation and strong demand. For bullish momentum to remain intact in the bigger picture, Bitcoin needs to stay above 66,000, which marked the low around the election period. As long as price holds above this key higher low, the broader uptrend remains in place, and any pullbacks can be viewed as potential buying opportunities. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Wrapping Up Bitcoin is currently in a state of pause after a strong run-up, with price coiling beneath resistance and holding above key support. This kind of consolidation often precedes a decisive move, and traders should be prepared for volatility to return once the range is broken. Whether the breakout comes to the upside or downside will depend on the strength of the next move around the 88,000 and 83,000 zones. As always, staying patient and reactive to price behavior at these key levels will be critical for navigating the next phase in Bitcoin's trend. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

There is something very satisfying about having a newspaper in your hands. Photo: Getty Sunday Independent newspaper Sir — Reading news printed on paper is not the same as listening to news on the radio or looking at it on the television or on your phone. Buying a newspaper in a shop, holding a newspaper or placing it on a table to read, turning the pages, choosing the order in which you read it, doing the crossword, placing a cup of tea in the middle of the page you’re not reading, cutting out an article to keep, folding the newspaper or rolling it and putting it in your back pocket, putting it in the recycle bin, or the tempus fugit frisson you get when you open and read a crumpled ball of newspaper once used to wrap a rediscovered vase in the attic — have no equivalents in other media modalities. Newsprint on paper has a physicality all of its own. Newspapers hold a mirror to society; they also hold a lamp — to expose what is ignored or what lies hidden or buried or forgotten. The quality of newspapers is an indicator of the quality of a society. In a world of 24/7 newsfeed, Sunday newspapers occupy a special place — more content, more investigative scoops, more reflective, more glossy, more supplements, more entertainment, more time to read, more news. Newspaper journalists and editors are key workers who provide an essential service; we saw this during Covid and we see it every time there is a crisis; we also see it when we look at countries where newspapers and media are organs of propaganda or in places where journalists are denied access. Being a newspaper journalist or editor is a challenging job, not least having to compete for readers who are being bombarded on all sides by free, fake, sensationalist news. In this context I would like to thank you, in your final edition, on the job you did as editor of the Sunday Independent. Chris Fitzpatrick, Terenure Road East, Dublin 6 Sir — Pope Francis ­re-energised Catholicism by ­living a simple life based on gospel values. By his energy, ­humanity, openness, humility, compassion, repentance and reforms, he regained the confidence of the flock. His successor needs to be cut from the same cloth as him. The decline in active priests ­requires consolidation and best use of its resources by the Catholic Church. Goodwill and generosity of spirit are required at all levels of the church, which must continue to adapt and modernise to meet the spiritual needs of contemporary society. Gender inequality and compulsory celibacy are denying the faithful the service of many fine individuals who would make ­excellent priests. Women have given outstanding ­service, devotion and loyalty to the church, but are denied ordination. Imag­ine the reinvigoration and energy, in addition to a substantial increase in available priests, that would permeate all levels of the church if women could become priests. A priest should always have the right to remain single but should also be entitled to marry. Likewise, ordination should be available to a married person. In a society where the role of the Catholic Church must be predominantly pastoral and inclusive, the sacraments of holy orders and matrimony can no longer be mutually exclusive. Francis has ensured the sustainability of Catholicism into the future. It will be less ­influential in secular society. It must co-exist and co-operate with other religions and none. It will have to work hard to retain the confidence of the laity. However, as long as it’s grounded in Francis’s values of social justice, humility, altruism, equality and reconciliation, count me in as an active and committed member. Billy Ryle, Spa, Tralee, Co Kerry Sir — In 2005, Paddy O’Gorman on his radio programme interviewed a betting man in a Cork bookie shop who had landed a healthy accumulator a few weeks earlier. Pope John Paul II had died the previous day, and our friend decided to use the manna from heaven to attend the funeral. So off they popped, the pious punter, his wife and sister-in-law. Rome, of course, was packed with mourners — roadblocks and diversions everywhere, thousands at the checkpoints. But our Leeside trio were ushered forward at every turn, right up to the cortege and with the best viewing points wherever they went. Apparently, the authorities and security crews assumed they had come from Poland, the Pope’s homeland, and gave them preferential treatment. They were wearing their Cork GAA jerseys. Des Nix, Raheny, Dublin 5 Sir — I am sure Saint ­Francis of Assisi would be so proud of his namesake, our humble Pope Francis, for his empathy for the poor and marginalised. Looking back on his visit to Ireland in 2018, it was difficult for him as he didn’t have the ­euphoria that marked Pope John Paul II’s wonderful time here. At the state event in Dublin Caste to honour his visit, Francis sat thoughtfully listening to then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s warm welcoming words, which were also laced with pointed criticism of the Catholic Church. There was a sense he was being chastised for all the church’s failings in Ireland and, perhaps, even those of the State. Pope Francis, with humility and dignity, acknowledged the shared pain of what he called the “repugnant crimes” of ­clerical abuse. He also saw the fun and the good in the person, whether believer or not. His sense of hum­our must have lightened the heavy burden on his heart and soul. On Easter Sunday, no doubt gravely ill, he still was giving, praying and smiling. The world and the church will be the poorer for his leaving us. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Sir — On the passing of dear Pope Francis The TV flashback showed him visiting the Capuchin monks Who feed the poor and destitute. They interviewed a homeless person there; she said: “If I wasn’t homeless I would never have met the Pope.” Derek Seymour, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Sir — I happened to find ­myself in possession of two diff­erent sized Cadbury Twirl Easter eggs (retailing at €10 and €6 respectively) and discovered the two eggs were the same size and weight (155g). The only difference in content between the two eggs (apart from the obviousinflated packaging of the more expensive egg) was one Twirl bar. Orla Maguire, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — I googled “Who can be elected Pope?” and was advised that any baptised male could be elected. Is the church aware of the definition of misogyny? M McMahon, Malahide, Co Dublin Sir — Reading comments last Sunday concerning the general subject of letter-writing brought me back to the days when the handwritten letter was the norm. My late mother said to me on several occasions that very intelligent people in some instances had poor handwriting. Given my own scrawl, I always felt that in her subtle way she was reassur­ing me that intellectually I wasn’t quite a write-off. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Sir — Education Minister ­Helen McEntee’s recent threat to introduce legislation to compel schools to take in pupils with special needs is an attempt to distract from the real problem. There is not a school or teacher in Ireland that would refuse admission to children with special needs if the proper facilities were provided by the minister and her department. I acknowledge that there is a serious problem for parents trying to get places for their children. Compelling schools is not necessary and certainly not the solution. There have been a few small units built to cater for children with special needs, but now the department and the minister are no longer providing the necessary grants. Instead, they are suggesting that existing classrooms be used if there are spare ones. In discussion with two ­National Council For Special Education reps recently when I was chairman of a board of management, I asked them about the sensory provision for the pupils. “You can hang a ­curtain in the corner of the classroom,” was the reply I got. Such absurdity I have never heard in my 40 years of involvement with a school. This just proves that the department and the minister are more interested in getting the numbers up than providing the proper facilities. Schools, principals, teachers and boards are absolutely willing to take in children with special needs. Ms McEntee, you need to provide the funding to properly upgrade classrooms or provide the necessary funding to build new units. The solution is in your hands. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Carlow Sir — On buying your ­paper last weekend, I hurried to read the articles on Rory McIroy’s ­triumph at the ­Masters. ­Eamonn Sweeney, Tommy ­Conlon and Paul ­Kimmage were excellent, but Declan Lynch nailed it. John McCann, Donegal Sir — Tom Gilsenan (Letters, April 20) opines that there is “a donkey in the White House”. If I were The Donald, I would take that as a compliment of the highest order. Anyone familiar with donkeys will know of their unbelievable qualities: hard-working, calm in stressful situations, wonderful with children, low-maintenance, soothing company, productive. More “donkeys” and fewer high-maintenance temperamental racehorses are needed in ­positions of authority as far as I’m concerned. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir — Eilis O’Hanlon’s article last Sunday on trans ideology was a damning indictment of both government and opposition parties for their failure to acknowledge what the vast ­majority of people believe. The other elephant in the room that her same arguments apply to is illegal immigration. For the past number of years the last government (with Sinn Féin complicit by their silence) ­ignored the law of the land to the extent that there are now 6,000 asylum-seekers from safe countries Georgia and Algeria out of a total of 33,000 in the direct provision system. These numbers are unsustainable, even without impending tariffs. And all sides of the Dáil are silent — shame on them. Bernie Cronin, Clondalkin, Dublin 22 Sir — I was heartbroken by Maeve Sheehan’s report in last week’s Sunday Independent (‘Grace: Harrowing neglect of severely disabled young girl’).It seems to me that the HSE didn’t ward Grace due to the fact that this case was so bad, it was afraid of what would be disclosed. It must be very frightening for disabled people if they know that the agency entrusted with caring for them is going to keep secrets and is not going to be open, honest and transparent regarding their care. This presents immense fear for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters of many disabled people and for disabled people themselves. We must remember that disabled children are three to four times more likely to be abused. It is much more challenging if one doesn’t have a voice. However, we must always be cognisant of the fact that these children can communicate. They communicate by how they behave, so it’s a question of learning what that means. We can often pick up what is going on when a child is initially happy, and then all of a sudden their behaviour changes. Examples of such changes in behaviour are evident if a child starts to hit their head or if they start to bite or scratch. Doctors, nurses, social workers and gardaí need to be properly trained in this area . I would like to know the level of expertise that was involved in the Grace inquiry. It seems to me a lot of solicitors and barristers were involved and not a lot of specialists. There is a gap in our understanding of disability and abuse. If we don’t learn from the Grace case, we will find similar cases emerging. Perish the thought. John O’Brien, clinical psychotherapist, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Sir — Reading the Farrelly Commission report is very depressing. It is unconscionable that a state organisation entrusted with the protection of all vulnerable people should hide the truth to protect itself. We now know that some in the HSE have different ethical codes of practice. This is very worrying and alarming. Those of us who are whistleblowers and know the issues despair of a failed HSE system not fit for purpose. We demand urg­ent political action that leads to safeguarding of our most vulnerable citizens. Dr Margaret Kennedy, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — In recent times I have read advice from financial experts telling workers to join their work pension scheme as early as possible in their working life, as this will put them in a more favourable financial position when they retire. That is good advice. There is another side to this. When a worker starts to draw their pension, they may have a reasonable expectation that their pension payment would keep them within shouting distance of the increasing cost of living. However, my experience has not achieved that expectation. I retired in 2010 after 34 years working for a very profitable company. When I was working I received annual increases in pay, but since I retired my modest pension has not increased by one cent in 15 years. Having not received any increase in my pension payment, I contacted the company and was told that because the pension plan was in deficit, the company had “decided not to award a discretionary increase this year”. I am not a member of any trade union or retirement group. I am a lone voice without power, except for my trusty pen. I note that the CEO of this company is paid millions. The rich are getting richer. Don’t worry about the “old” people. David Riedy, Co Limerick Sir — David Quinn claims that protests on US university campuses “should not be euphemistically described as merely ‘pro-Palestinian’” (‘Student politics is no joke — radicals are sounding alarm bells’, April 20). He is correct, but for the wrong reasons. The protesters in question, like their fellow students elsewhere, are demonstrating in support of international humanitarian law and for ending the impunity that the state of Israel — plausiblyaccused of genocide by the International Court of Justice — enjoys, thanks to the unconditional support it receives from US and EU governments. It is natural that those who support that impunity should experience “hostility”, but to attribute such sensitivity to their being Jewish or Israeli is merelyto accept the Israeli state’s tactic of attributing all opposition to its crimes as antisemitic. In the days of South African apartheid, I’ve little doubt that supporters of white supremacism in South Africa suffered similar unease in the face of protests over racial equality. Raymond Deane, Dublin 7 Sir — David Quinn states that the “Boycott, Divest, Sanction” movement … essentially wants to destroy the Jewish State”. This is not true. Boycott, Div­estment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. It upholds the principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as everyone.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh By María Paula Mijares Torres Apr 26, 2025 (Bloomberg) –President Donald Trump called for “free of charge” passage of American ships through the Panama and Suez canals, renewing his focus of expanding US influence over critical commercial and naval waterways. While Trump began pushing for an exit of Chinese port operators around the Panama Canal soon after returning to the White House in January, the post on his Truth Social network on Saturday also turned attention to the Suez Canal, which cuts through Egypt to link the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. “Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America,” Trump said, adding that he’s asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. Trump’s focus — with tariffs and other measures, such as proposed fees at US ports — has been on Chinese commercial shipping and shipbuilding, with the ultimate goal of promoting a revival of US shipbuilding. The US government argues that China’s dominance in ship construction was achieved unfairly and harms US interests. US commercial shipbuilding, once a global leader, has shriveled since the 1980s due to subsidy cuts and foreign competition.
