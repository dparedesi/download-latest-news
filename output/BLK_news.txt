Bitfinex Securities and NexBridge, a digital asset issuer focused on tokenization of financial assets, have teamed up to launch the first tokenized US Treasury bill in El Salvador. The tokenized T-bill, USTBL, leverages Bitcoin technology. Specifically, the issuers are leveraging the flagship digital asset’s Liquid Network and Blockstream AMP, an asset management platform that allows users to issue and manage crypto assets on the Liquid Network. According to a press release, the product will have an initial offering soft capped at $30 million, and will offer investors access to US Treasury returns in USD. USTBL is backed by iShares Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF, the short-term Treasury bond ETF of asset management giant BlackRock. Initial subscriptions open on November 19, 2024, and closes on November 29. However, investors will also get access via further subscription windows. Subscriptions are initially available in the stablecoin Tether (USDT), while the issuers have plans to add support for Bitcoin (BTC). “The inclusion of USTBL tokens in investment portfolios will enable investors to balance digital asset exposure with the stability of traditional finance, offering a new level of diversification that can help reduce overall portfolio risk,” Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, said in a statement. Michele Crivelli, founder of NexBridge, added: “By leveraging Bitcoin’s technology and infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for a globally accessible financial ecosystem, bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to investors worldwide while maintaining full regulatory compliance.” This launch comes amid massive traction across real-world assets tokenization. The RWA on-chain market has grown rapidly with products such as funds, bonds and credit. According to rwa.xyz, the global RWA market is currently over $13 billion, with tokenized US treasuries, bonds and cash equivalents at $2.4 billion.

Title: COP29 Must Deliver the Goods

Geopolitical turmoil must not be allowed to distract global decision-makers from the urgent imperative of tackling climate change. There is no excuse for letting COP29 conclude without delivering ambitious, credible financing commitments to support climate action – including the clean-energy transition – in developing economies. MADRID – Last week, the World Leaders Climate Action Summit took place within the framework of the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan. But the gathering attracted less fanfare than it has in the past – a change that does not bode well for our collective future. One reason for the reduced attention to COP29 is the watered-down attendance list: the leaders of the world’s 13 highest-emission countries have decided to skip the event altogether, partly because a G20 summit was scheduled at the same time. The heads of major financial institutions, including Bank of America and BlackRock, have also stayed away from this year’s conference, despite its focus on finance. And the decision to hold the event in Azerbaijan – a country heavily reliant on natural gas – has elicited accusations of “greenwashing” by environmental activists. As with last year’s COP in Dubai, the choice of host highlights the need to come to terms with natural gas as a long-term energy source. More broadly, the world has a lot on its mind. As the Ukraine war approaches its fourth year, a Russian counteroffensive to retake land in the Kursk region – supported by more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers – appears to be imminent. Meanwhile, Israel is fighting on two fronts, in Gaza and Lebanon, and escalation into a wider war appears far more likely than de-escalation. And while it is impossible to predict exactly what the capricious Donald Trump will do once he returns to the White House, the risks of geopolitical instability, democratic erosion, and a sharp reversal on climate policy loom large. A longtime climate-change denier and proponent of the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, Trump has pledged to withdraw the United States from the “horrendously unfair” Paris climate agreement, as he did during his first term in office. According to some reports, an executive order to begin this process has already been drafted. Trump also plans to increase US gas production and exports, and terminate the Green New Deal – which he calls the “Green New Scam” – by rescinding all unspent funds under the “misnamed” Inflation Reduction Act. Recent remarks by Myron Ebell, who helped lead a transition team during Trump’s previous administration, are ominous: “We’re not going to worry about emissions anymore,” he declared bluntly. The “sooner you forget all this stuff about reducing emissions, the better.” While one should not underestimate the threat that Trump poses to the climate, there is reason to hope that the worst-case scenarios will not materialize. During his first term, Trump’s bombastic declarations were not always followed by the promised action. Moreover, states, cities, organizations, and individuals stepped up to protect the climate, partly offsetting the federal government’s failures.

Subscribe Now In any case, the scale of the Trump shock to the environment will become apparent only after he takes office in January. COP29 is happening now, and its objectives cannot wait. Dubbed the “finance COP,” the gathering in Baku is supposed to address the vast climate-finance gap faced by developing countries. The much-touted $100 billion annual target – which developed economies agreed in 2009 that they would meet by 2020 – was reached for the first time just two years ago. The delay notwithstanding, it is nowhere near enough: the annual financing needs of emerging and developing economies (excluding China) are expected to reach about $2.4 trillion by 2030. Against this backdrop, participants at COP29 are attempting to negotiate a New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. One hopes that the figure ultimately adopted is ambitious. But whatever it is, it will almost certainly fall short of developing countries’ needs. Moreover, implementation will pose a major challenge, as it will have to be handled largely by the private sector, especially private financial institutions. In many countries, particularly in Africa, the clean-energy transition is complicated by a lack of access to electricity. The strong correlation between consistent baseload power and economic prosperity sends a clear message: a reliable, affordable power supply is essential to development. And yet 570 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa still lack access – 80% of the global total – and the number has grown since 2021. Rapid population growth in the Global South is set to exacerbate the problem. Africa alone is expected to be home to 2.5 billion people in 2050 – up from 1.5 billion today. Renewable-energy sources are simply not reliable enough to meet the mushrooming demand that this implies. Hydrogen and nuclear can help to fill the gaps, but both require huge upfront infrastructure investments, which public budgets cannot cover. Mobilizing private capital is thus crucial. To this end, governments must devise effective strategies to mitigate risk and foster a supportive investment environment. Strategic partnerships among governments, international financial institutions (IFIs), and the private sector will be crucial. While many IFIs are still in the early stages of developing their green industrial strategies, they must play a central role in catalyzing private-sector investment and smoothing the clean-energy transition in emerging and developing economies. This includes helping to de-risk investments for first movers and supporting governments in setting ambitious goals, defining pathways to achieve them, and establishing policy frameworks and standards. The Baku Initiative for Climate Finance, Investment, and Trade is a step in the right direction, as it aims to encourage the creation of national, regional, and sub-regional platforms to maximize all three. But, without global buy-in, the impact of such initiatives will be limited. Even at a time of growing geopolitical disruption, we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from the imperative of tackling climate change.

Trump is correct…we don’t have a climate emergency that needs extravaganzas like COPS or the UN Paris accord.. This is borne out by the Climate Realists able to take the IPCC data and show “no emergency and no need for NetZero” and they make a very good argument... Its only the IPCC admin that are using the emergency tag to get a payday from the west.When you study the scientific facts on the impact of the climate so far, it’s not been an issue with most impact indicators showing no change or even decline. Its only the predictions using models that keep getting it wrong that show any risk. Further our ability to adapt has improved considerably with technology, and I must say, with the use of Fossil fuels.Saying we are “beyond debate” and that “the science is settled” won’t cut it any more with most of the population wanting much more review… Also, many don’t support the notion that the west owes the rest anything in terms of wealth transfer. I would argue they owe the west a lot for the free trade and technology, and I would even say some of the colonization we provided greatly assisted many of them move toward a modern society. I am not suggesting we don’t need to focus on sustainability and continue the great work so far on reducing our load on the environment (But not the climate with mitigation) and the best way to get that done is with pushing prosperity on a global scale as poor people wont focus much on what is needed or control their population for that matter… so we may have to rethink our NetZero journey and allow the use of fossil fuels which is the lowest cost energy that exists across the globe to grow prosperity rapidly before we can even think about NetZero that certainly looks unnecessary, technologically unattainable, economically unviable and extremely foolish.More at https://nigelsouthway.substack.com/p/no-netzero It appears that you have not yet updated your first and last name.

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet is this week’s World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | What are your biggest snubs for the 2024 Game Awards? The War Within Season 1 continues and we’ve made another full circuit of all the World Bosses with the return this week of Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time.The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin.The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters:Ring is Critical Strike/Haste, with Critical Strike providing most of the secondary statsCloth classes can get a Chest that matches the Priest appearance or a Belt that matches the Warlock setLeather classes have a chance at Legs that match the Demon Hunter set or Boots that match the Monk appearanceMail classes can receive a Chest that matches the Hunter appearance or Boots that match the Shaman setPlate classes have a chance at Legs that match the Death Knight set or a Belt that matches the Paladin appearanceAs always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Azj-Kahet, World Boss, World QuestAdvertisement The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair.

Title: Lessons For Sustainability Investing From The 2024 Election
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2024/11/19/lessons-for-sustainability-investing-from-the-2024-election/

The future may lie with a carbon tax, private sector innovation, economic inclusion of communities left behind and muscular corporate governance. Businesses will continue to treat ESG problems as business problems. Republican elephant US Presidential Election 2024 Banner with infographics of republicans. American ... [+] Election campaign statistics or results of republican party. Electoral symbol with map and graphs. Vector illustration. The scale of the defeat of the Democratic party in the 2024 election is staggering. They have lost the House, the Senate, the Presidency and one might argue the Supreme Court. The question now is what, if anything, can the sustainability movement learn from this defeat? What can one do over the next four years? To answer this question, consider arguments under E/S and G categories, for expositional ease. 1.0 Environment: 1.1 Reporting as the theory of change to address climate might have peaked: Did we burn too much political capital on the theory of change caused by extensive reporting of emissions and climate risk exposure? The theory, loosely speaking, was to force firms to disclose their emissions. Market participants could then channel capital away from firms that disclose more emissions and hence increase their cost of capital. Capital would flow to firms that report smaller or even negative emissions (as they remove carbon) and hence encourage innovation in producing scalable cheap green energy. The theory proved to be somewhat simplistic as my co-authors and I have shown in several papers. Green innovation took off thanks to subsidies not reporting. It is not obvious that divestment in equity of the so-called sin stocks hurts the cost of capital of firms that sell sin. The SEC climate risk rule will probably be shelved although more and more firms are voluntarily disclosing scope 1 and 2 emissions anyway. Abandoning the SEC’s climate risk rule makes the ISSB the de-facto ESG/sustainability standard setter for the world. The ISSB is shareholder focused and is hence more likely to strike a balance between decision usefulness of new data points for valuation and risk assessment relative to compliance costs imposed on firms, unlike CSRD, CSDDD and the like asked for by the EU. The extra-territorial requirements imposed by the EU disclosure rules and California’s emission disclosure requirements will force most US multi-national and inter-state companies to report on climate risk and emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3 for California) anyway. But pushing reporting as the theory of change to address climate risk may have peaked with the 2024 election. 1.2 Push for a sensible carbon tax: Instead of worrying about net zero commitments that very few firms were on track to fulfil anyway, should we instead advocate for a price on carbon? Neither side of the political spectrum is happy with how the current system works. We have defaulted to a world where we hold fossil fuel manufacturers, asset managers and financial institutions to account for high carbon products and services. As a result, we have implicitly absolved politicians and consumers from their responsibility to reduce society’s carbon footprint. Creating a set of rules for red states separately from that for blue states is not sustainable in the long run. By asking banks and other companies to deprive fossil fuel firms of investment, we expose ourselves to the risk of energy insecurity as supply demand imbalances will spike gas prices as we saw after the Ukraine invasion. Making public companies report carbon emissions will create incentives for high carbon emission units to go dark or go private. Such arbitrage, in turn, only enables a small number of individuals or funds to make outsized financial returns at the cost of societal pain. A carbon tax would automatically increase the prices of carbon intensive goods, lead to lower demand for such goods and hence coax consumers to switch to low carbon alternatives, wherever available. If low carbon alternatives are not available, innovation dollars will more readily flow to try and discover such alternatives. Indigent citizens, dependent on high carbon products such as commuting and heating oil, will naturally have to be shielded from the economic pain of a carbon tax for a while via subsidies that are financed from the revenue that flows in from carbon taxes. Banks and financial companies will have to then account for the impact of the carbon tax explicitly on the cash flows and credit worthiness of the companies they finance. The cost of capital to finance carbon friendly solutions will automatically fall. On top of that, a gradually increasing carbon tax will provide much needed certainty to businesses about the US’s regulatory response to climate change. In sum, we need a cohesive agenda where every citizen has skin in the game to address the climate crisis. A carbon tax is perhaps the only viable tool at our disposal. Without a carbon tax, climate losses will keep escalating and will eventually be borne by the taxpayer, one way or the other. A targeted well designed carbon tax now will stop worse outcomes in the future such as energy insecurity and social unrest. I hope both the red and blue stripes of our country can come together around a carbon tax. The alternative is a much bigger bill for taxpayers and the planet in the future. Thankfully, a small bipartisan caucus supporting a carbon tax does exist. Is it time to get to know and empower that caucus? 1.3 Coalesce around innovation and bipartisan agreement: There are several small wins that both sides can agree on. Republicans are unlikely to be averse to setting up a carbon market with adequate guardrails. Both Republicans and Democrats can come together on permitting reform. The Republicans will potentially push for permits for oil and gas firms and the Democrats for renewables. Presumably both agree on the focus on nuclear energy. It is interesting to observe that Microsoft, Amazon and Google have invested in nuclear power to deal with the ravenous power needs of the AI revolution. The political left would also do well to stop calling for the end of fossil fuel companies as the pace of the energy transition is likely to slower than previously thought possible and because we have not given consumers an alternative to fossil fuel in most cases. Perhaps one could focus on opportunities to innovate out of the climate hole in the form of new technology to make green technology affordable at scale. Out-innovating China and Europe is surely the best version of an “America First” policy. 1.4 Live with segmented markets in the US and overseas: Turning to green bonds, net zero commitments and green financing in general, markets are geographically segmented as Europe has pursued these initiatives more vigorously than we have. Blue states are also likely to pursue decarbonization and transition at the local level (city, municipality) via building codes, traffic tolls and the like. Impact and ESG investors are likely to cluster in the blue states and in Europe. For instance, BlackRock sells sustainable investing strategies more successfully in Europe than in the United States. The rhetoric fueling the anti-ESG movement in the red states will hopefully die down. The blue states might double down on ESG almost as a means of resistance. Fragmentation in rules will lead a Balkanized regulatory framework that will increase a firms’ cost of compliance and risk management. Of course, the business reality on the ground is much more complex and displays shades of red and blue. Texas, for instance, is already a leader in clean energy. My co-authors, Dhruv Aggarwal and Lubo Litov, and I have just discovered that the state pension fund that votes the most aggressively against “Say on Pay” proposals related to CEO compensation was not New York, or California but Florida! 2.0 Social factors: It is quite clear from the data that voters in rural areas and small towns did not vote for the Democratic party. The educational, healthcare and social support infrastructure in these areas leaves much to be desired. Recognizing fully that it is not necessarily the remit of companies to address social problems, could we consider a world where: · we provide subsidies to companies to open distribution centers or factories in these regions. Perhaps the state picks up the health care costs of private sector workers located in these areas. Healthcare is a significant driver of outsourcing and the temping of America. · we in-source our call centers from overseas to these regions. · we find opportunities for folks in rural areas to work remotely for larger firms. · we provide a quota for rural and small-town poor students in our elite universities, with family incomes below a certain threshold, and add service back home as a criterion for such assistance. · we provide subsidies for universities or community colleges or coaching academies to train the workforce in these areas for service jobs, given that manufacturing is not coming back to the US. A quick glance at the 50 poorest counties in the US suggests that most of them host prisons or correctional facilities. The US census finds that roughly 20 million people lived in a persistent poverty county in the 30-year period spanning 1989-2019. The 341 counties identified in persistent poverty were not evenly distributed throughout the US. Over 80% were in the South and nearly 20% of all counties in the South were in persistent poverty. Many were clustered in informal subregions such as the Southwest border, the Mississippi Delta, the Southeast, Appalachia, and in some counties with higher amounts of American Indian and Alaska Native tribal lands. Although, this is not just a red state problem. It turns out that 21% of the counties in New York state are persistently poor. Can companies that aim to do well by doing good play a part in addressing persistent poverty, with appropriate attention and help from the Government? 3.0 Push on G: Make the lives of activists and short sellers easier: The implicit idea that sustainability investing is about long-term corporate thinking or long-term EPS, as opposed to next year’s EPS. It is hard for me to believe that long term thinking is somehow out of fashion after the election or less needed than before. Indexers will continue to hold stocks for decades. The question is whether we want them to be disengaged owners. If yes, will the new administration consider empowering short sellers and activists such as Elliott Management or Trian to release capital trapped in overvalued firms and invest more capital in undervalued firms? As I have written many times before, there are hundreds of firms in the S&P 1500 that have not earned a return that covers the opportunity cost of investing in US treasuries. Finally, it is worth repeating that businesses, even without ESG investing, will do what it takes to address changing social norms of the customers, workers and communities they interact with. This is because most ESG problems are business problems, as articulated next. 4.0 Most sustainability/ESG problems are business problems I have stated several times that, to me, sustainability/ESG problems are mostly business problems. I am not sure much is going to change on this dimension. To illustrate this argument, consider the risk factors disclosed by Waste Management, a company headquartered in Houston Texas (a red state), in its 2023 10-K. I have classified these risk factors as E and S. One does not expect to see G flagged as risk factors as no CEO wants to suggest that his governance ecosystem is not effective. I have left brief comments under a few risk factors to indicate whether the new administration will mitigate relevant risks for Waste Management (WM). E risk factors 1. We utilize an energy surcharge and other mandated fees. 2. Supply chain, regulatory or permitting disruptions or delays could detrimentally impact the execution timeline for our planned expansion of our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy businesses. · It is hard for me to believe that WM will quit the recycling business because of the new administration. 3. Our operations must comply with extensive existing regulations, and changes in regulations (environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, limitations, bans, taxes or charges on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste, significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation, environmental regulatory changes; new information about waste types previously collected, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) or other emerging contaminates and other reasons, governmental entities have increased their interest in implementing EPR regulations to reduce municipal spending on recycling programs). · Some of these regulations will ease. But class action lawyers might end up becoming more aggressive if enforcement agencies back off. 4. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity at our landfills, due to land scarcity, public opposition or otherwise, which can require us to identify disposal alternatives, resulting in decreased revenue and increased costs. 5. We have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices, and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments. · Businesses make long term investments that are harder to simply unwind because of a new administration. 6. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance may not be indicative of our future results. · Good businesses, regardless of whether they are in a blue state or a red state, worry about the cash flow implications of climate change. 7. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. · It is again hard to believe that the entire apparatus of environmental, health and safety laws will be abandoned by the new administration. 8. Our sustainability growth strategy includes significant planned and ongoing investments in our WM Renewable Energy segment; changes to federal and state renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance, and such investments may not yield the results anticipated. 9. The impact of climate change, and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs, could increase our costs to operate. · The costs of having to comply with climate change legislation may fall but WM operates in California and is hence subject to that state’s Clean Fuels Program and Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act. S risk factors 10. Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. · This is the textbook argument for why companies have incentives to worry about stakeholders in the long run, even if there are no regulations mandating such a focus. 11. We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel. 12. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. 13. If we are unable to attract, hire or retain key team members and a high-quality workforce, or if our succession planning does not develop an adequate pipeline of future leaders, it could disrupt our business, jeopardize our strategic priorities and result in increased costs, negatively impacting our results of operations. 14. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. 15. Increases in our labor costs as a result of labor unions organizing, changes in regulations related to labor unions or increases in employee minimum wages, could adversely affect our future results. 16. We may not be able to achieve our sustainability related goals, including reduction of our greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, or execute on our sustainability-related growth strategy and initiatives, within planned timelines or anticipated budget, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact the benefits anticipated from our investments. · These risks will dramatically fall under a Trump administration. 17. Focus on, and regulation of, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance and disclosure can result in increased costs, risk of noncompliance, damage to our reputation and related adverse effects. · These risks will dramatically fall under a Trump administration. 18. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. · One could argue that customer preferences will encourage innovation in private structures to effectively signal participation in green initiatives. 19. Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business, subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability. 20. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans. The long and short of this review is that it is difficult to imagine a radical rehaul of firms’ strategies, which intentionally or otherwise are designed to care for stakeholder interests, just because of the 2024 election. In sum, the sustainability movement would do well to pivot to innovation around affordable green energy at scale, a carbon tax supplemented by a well-functioning carbon market and corporate social responsibility at home to address the plight of those left behind in the last three decades. Neither party wants managers to waste capital that can be released by doubling down on G. Businesses will do what it takes to address changing social norms of the customers, workers and communities they interact with. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: How NationSwell Is Catalyzing Impact Through Collaboration And Purpose-Driven Leadership

Founded as a B-Corp, NationSwell is a force for social, economic, and environmental progress In the world of purpose-driven business, few organizations exemplify leadership and impact as clearly as NationSwell. Founded as a B-Corp, NationSwell is a force for social, economic, and environmental progress. Its mission? To empower impact leaders across sectors with the community, support, and capabilities they need to accelerate their work and drive systemic change. Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell, recently sat down with me and shared the organization’s purpose and vision and how it tackles some of today’s most pressing challenges through collaboration and innovation. “We’re a B-Corp that draws inspiration from impact leaders who are driving progress and working to build the future we need. We built a company to be in deep service to those leaders. Our mission at NationSwell is to provide the expert community and the essential support those leaders need to lead at their best.” NationSwell’s vision, he added, is to be “the world’s leading partner powering a thriving social impact ecosystem: supporting the community of cross-sector partners working together to make the world more fair, just and prosperous for everyone.” A Diverse, Cross-Sector Community NationSwell’s community is intentionally curated, comprising around 150 leading companies, investment firms, financial institutions, private foundations, nonprofits, and individual visionary and community-based leaders, who were invited to join the membership community and with whom NationSwell actively partners. This diverse membership spans industries and sectors, creating a vibrant, collaborative network. “We’ve sought to curate the community with authentic and committed leaders doing inspired work – and have intentionally designed the community to cut across industries and sectors,” Behrman explained. “So often impact leaders know the person in their role in their space. NationSwell helps to open the aperture,” he added. The goal is to foster cross-sector collaboration and partnerships that spark innovation and drive systemic change. NationSwell’s unique model focuses on deep, impact-driven, and human-centered engagement, offering members a range of services including insights and best practices; catalytic connections and relationship development; intimate and actionable conversations and experiences; and award-winning strategic consulting, thought leadership, and creative storytelling. “Our members are busy. A lot is coming at them, and a lot is demanded of them. They are also service-minded and always thinking of how best to support others,” Behrman noted. “Our nimble, personalized model enables us to be the partner that is there to serve them. They deserve it.” Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell Supporting Leaders in Turbulent Times The current landscape is rife with uncertainty, and NationSwell is stepping up to help its members navigate these challenges. Behrman described how the organization is providing vital insights, resources, and connections to help leaders stay effective and inspired. “We are helping our members and partners to navigate uncertainty and turbulence by ensuring they have exposure to what others are doing and thinking, and line of sight into what’s working best,” says Behrman. Through curated conversations with peer leaders and visionaries, NationSwell fosters collaboration and shared learning. Additionally, they’re focusing on supporting leaders; and broader impact teams, recognizing the critical role of the emerging leaders in shaping the future of the field. Driving Collective Action Through Collaboratives A cornerstone of NationSwell’s work is its Collaboratives—intensive programs that unite funders, experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. These initiatives are designed to facilitate shared action, providing the structure and expertise necessary for impactful collaboration. “Our Collaboratives are designed and optimized to provide a range of support. Through Collaboratives we bring together incredible groups of funders, experts, practitioners, and community-based leaders — taking them on a shared action journey designed to help them learn, connect, elevate their work and grantees; refine their strategies and efforts; and identify opportunities for co-investment and shared action,” Behrman explained. Recent efforts include programs like Case for Childcare and Place-Based Impact, both of which recently earned Anthem Awards. Those Collaboratives were launched in partnership with organizations like Pivotal Ventures, Annie E. Casey Foundation, BlackRock Foundation, Starbucks, Mass Mutual, Cisco, KPMG, and American Family Insurance. At Climate Week this year, they launched a new Collaborative on Clear Air in partnership with Coupa. This week, they are launching a new Collaborative on Collective Wealth Building, developed in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Travelers, and other key funders to address wealth disparities and promote community prosperity. Behrman highlighted the value these Collaboratives bring: “Each Collaborative also produces one-of-a-kind resources that fill a gap and help advance the field.” A cornerstone of NationSwell’s work is its Collaboratives—intensive programs that unite funders, ... [+] experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. Pioneering Partnerships and Initiatives NationSwell’s impact extends far beyond its Collaboratives. Behrman highlighted several key initiatives, such as a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to advance health equity and a collaboration with Omidyar Network to explore responsible uses of AI. In the workforce development space, NationSwell is currently partnering with JP Morgan Chase - and a range of other leading local stake-holders - to design a system-wide strategy in Columbus, Ohio. It also partnered with Stacey Abrams, her sister Andrea, and the team at American Pride Rises to support DEI initiatives. On the democracy and civic engagement front, NationSwell produced Civics Inc., a report that explores how companies can activate their employees and communities. This report, developed with Patagonia, recently won an Anthem Award and was highlighted in a Fortune article co-authored with Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert. Advice for Purpose-Driven Leaders Behrman’s advice for leaders navigating today’s complex landscape? Three things. Stay deeply anchored in core values and deepest beliefs, remain curious and open to listening, and recognize the vital role of impact leaders. “Their vision, voices, and values will light the way forward,” he emphasized. NationSwell’s work is a testament to the power of collaboration and the potential for purposeful leadership to drive meaningful change. As Behrman put it, “I believe impact leaders will do their best and most important work in the years ahead. That provides me with purpose and hope.” One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Snowflake Inc (SNOW)’s AI Edge: Why Analysts Are Betting on Future Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. According to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, artificial intelligence models capable of performing at human levels may emerge as early as 2026. That is, if current advancements hold steady. Amodei compares the path to general artificial intelligence with educational stages. Currently, he notes that we’re starting to get to PhD level, while last year we were at the undergraduate level. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Making Waves Today and 10 AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News and Analyst Ratings “If you just eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we’ll get there by 2026 or 2027”. He also acknowledged that possible setbacks may exist, such as data shortages, limitations in scaling AI clusters, and potential geopolitical issues impacting microchip supply chains. Previously, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a similar claim, noting that artificial general intelligence can be achieved in five years with the current hardware. According to Altman, the benchmark would pose “surprisingly little” change to society. How fast we can get to AGI is a debate of its own. In the meantime, let’s take a closer look at the latest developments and innovations shaping the world of artificial intelligence. In its first, a robot has been trained by watching videos of seasoned surgeons, performing the same surgical procedures skillfully as human doctors. The findings, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, were illuminated at the Conference on Robot Learning in Munich, a top event for robotics and machine learning. “It’s really magical to have this model and all we do is feed it camera input and it can predict the robotic movements needed for surgery. We believe this marks a significant step forward toward a new frontier in medical robotics.” In other news, CNBC’s David Faber reports that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. Musk’s AI startup seeks to “understand the true nature of the universe. Last year, xAI released a chatbot named Grok, modeled after “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” The chatbot aims to directly compete with companies including ChatGPT creator OpenAI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer at work, surrounded by a wall of computer monitors connected to a 'Data Cloud' platform. Market Capitalization: $42.2 billion Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is an artificial intelligence data cloud company. It integrates AI and machine-learning capabilities into its platform allowing customers to create generative AI applications and build large language models. On November 15, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne maintained a “Buy” rating on Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and set a price target of $170.00. The buy rating comes from a slight quarter-over-quarter improvement in sentiment. Moreover, survey results conducted with decision-makers at 15 large partners also suggest the company’s product growth may accelerate in 2025, with a possible increase in pace. The analyst notes speeding up in case its artificial intelligence (AI) features help boost data usage. Overall, SNOW ranks 10th on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SNOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The oil industry is currently undergoing a massive consolidation wave. Sector leader ExxonMobil kicked things off by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources in a more than $60 billion deal. Several other oil companies also struck deals to acquire smaller rivals, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which bought CrownRock in a $12 billion deal. Palantir is one of the hottest artificial intelligence stocks on the market. Trump Media stock surged on Monday following a report the company is in advanced talks to acquire crypto exchange Bakkt.

Title: Jim Cramer Sees Bright Future for Broadcom (AVGO) Amid AI Expansion and Strong Client Deals

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Mad Money Episode: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's "easy" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some "serious gains." "I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense." Cramer said banks do not "care" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation. "I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds."

A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130 Commenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said: “I am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don’t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.” Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Companies say RTO mandates make work more creative — it might take more than that
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandate-may-not-be-enough-to-boost-creativity-collaboration-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-19T09:49:10Z

Companies are betting that asking employees to return to the office will help boost creativity. HR pros say that's only the start. While being physically present may boost collaboration and the flow of ideas, workplace specialists told Business Insider that RTO mandates alone might not be the answer. To get the rest of the way, companies need bosses and a culture that fosters creativity. "You can have a fully in-person organization and still not optimize those things because your culture and your leadership don't bring them out in their people," said Leena Rinne, the vice president of coaching at the corporate training platform Skillsoft. "If you have a really stifling and unsafe culture, but you're trying to get more creativity, bringing people back together is not going to get you there." Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told all corporate employees they had to be in the office five days a week. Goldman Sachs, Salesforce, and JPMorgan have done the same. Bosses want "the water cooler effect" of spontaneous collaboration, said Cary Cooper, a professor of organizational psychology and health at the Manchester Business School. Whether they get it is another question — research on RTO benefits has been inconclusive. Some studies found that returning to the office doesn't really improve employee performance and may drive them to quit. Others suggest it can improve collaboration and strengthen bonds between employees. Alongside any office-return rules, employers should "rethink the role of the manager," Cooper said. He recommended prioritizing soft skills that will help leaders motivate their teams, particularly Gen Zers new to the workplace. "We've been recruiting the wrong kind of manager for this generation," he said. Those staff "want a better work-life balance," Cooper said. "And they want a good quality of working life. That means somebody has to create that, and that somebody has to have good social skills." Workers often don't love being asked to return to the office. At Dell, almost half of US staff rejected the back-to-office call. At Amazon, some employees have joked that they would rather be fired than comply. Jeri Doris, the SVP of people at the HR and payroll platform Justworks, said companies need to justify the working setup they choose, not just mandate it. "We need to treat people like adults," Doris said. The goal should be "creating an environment where people can grow, thrive, and feel seen." Doris recommended tying office attendance to particular tasks, like coming in for particular meetings. Rinne, the workplace-coaching pro, cautioned against an "executive nostalgia" that pushes old-school bosses to want workers where they can see them. "We're not going back to the workplace of yesteryear," she said. "It's different now. We feel different. We have different skills." She said that creativity and personal resilience at work both proliferated with the rise of remote work. Poorly-executed returns can erode them. "If we want more collaboration, what do our people and our leaders need to be doing to accelerate collaboration?" Rinne said. "Because it's not just me and you sitting in the same room that makes us collaborate." Overall, strategy isn't what gets results, Rinne said. "It's your people who get your results," she said. "How I show up to work every day drives what I accomplish and how I contribute to this organization," she added. "If I'm leaning in and excited about it, that's very different from leaning out and doing the bare minimum." Jump to

Tuesday, 19 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor (pic) over the alleged purchase of luxury goods from 1MDB's monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah's application to recuse him from presiding over the case. ALSO READ: ‘US$346mil luxury goods linked to 1MDB, SRC scandal’ In his brief decision on Tuesday, JC Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah's supporting affidavit, she stated that the JC was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. "After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. "In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge," JC Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah has applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. ALSO READ: Rosmah amassed RM1.63bil worth of jewellery, designer goods with 1MDB funds, court told On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah's recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before JC Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). Other plaintiffs are Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as the first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) as the second defendant. They claim that Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on behalf of Rosmah. The plaintiffs claim that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities - including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery - before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. "A total of 320 such payments totalling US$346,010,489 were made," the plaintiffs stated. They further claim the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs have an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: BlackRock Bags Abu Dhabi’s Operational License For AI And Private Markets

Written by Rida Fatima Crypto Journalist Fact Checked by Asad Gilani Crypto Editor Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key takeaways The prominent global investment and asset management company BlackRock has received Abu Dhabi’s operational license. A November 18 Bloomberg report disclosed this newest development regarding BlackRock’s expansion moves. The report noted that the license will enable the asset manager to diversify its AI and private markets in the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). BlackRock also seeks a license to operate in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial hub in the region. This new office will enable the company to work closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers, and Abu Dhabi-based investment entities. ADGM stands out due to the participation of several crypto-related entities, including M2, Blockdaemon, Laser Digital, and others. In a statement to Bloomberg, Charles Hatami, BlackRock’s Middle East Head, disclosed the company’s scope of activities via its expansion to Abu Dhabi. He pointed out that BlackRock will focus on artificial intelligence infrastructure and private markets in the region. Further, Hatami applauded Abu Dhabi’s proactiveness and commitment to innovation, labeling the region as a “global financial center.” He noted that the region has become an attractive hub with its friendly policies for different companies and businesses. Hatami stated: “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” BlackRock’s latest operational license in Abu Dhabi comes at the heel of another license from Saudi Arabia last month. The asset manager received approval to establish its regional headquarters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This move aligns with BlackRock’s efforts to expand within the region. Earlier this year, the company disclosed its readiness to allocate $5 billion from its Public Investment Fund to invest in the Middle East and develop a Riyadh-based investment team. BlackRock remains distinctive as the issuer of the largest US-based spot Bitcoin ETF. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, boasts net inflows of over $29.28 billion and total assets worth $42.89 billion as of November 15. The UAE has recorded a growing dominance in digital finance. According to an August report from investment migration consultancy company Henley & Partners, UAE ranked third in a crypto adoption index. The nation’s capital, Abu Dhabi, has become one of the regions with a favorable environment for innovative technology and financial growth. This friendly atmosphere has attracted various AI companies and investments. In April, Microsoft revealed its $1.6 billion investment in an Abu Dhabi-based AI tech entity, G42. Also, in September, Microsoft disclosed its plan to develop two AI centers in the region. This move aligns with the tech company’s goal of global AI expansion. Microsoft highlighted that one of the centers will help AI projects that resolve key societal goals. Meanwhile, the other center will concentrate on creating industry standards for the responsible use of AI. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

(NYSE: MUI, the Fund) tender offer (a Tender Offer) for up to 50% of its outstanding common shares (the Shares). The Tender Offers, which expired at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on November 15, 2024, was oversubscribed. Therefore, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, the Fund will purchase Shares from all tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis, after disregarding fractions, based on the number of Shares properly tendered (Pro-Ration Factor). The final results of the Tender Offer are provided in the table below.

Questions regarding the Tender Offer may be directed to Georgeson LLC, the Information Agent for the Tender Offer, toll free at the numbers disclosed in the Fund's Offer to Purchase. Conversion to an Unlisted Interval Fund As previously announced, the Fund will be converting from an exchange-listed, closed-end fund to an unlisted, continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts periodic repurchases of its shares, also known as an interval fund (the Conversion). The Fund's Shares will continue to trade on the NYSE until the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE, which will be announced at a later date. It is currently expected that the Conversion will occur in the first quarter of 2025, on such date as will be announced by the Fund. Shareholders who continue to hold Shares following the completion of the Tender Offer, but who do not wish to hold Shares of an unlisted interval fund, may sell their Shares in the normal course on the NYSE prior to the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE. Please note that, following the Conversion, the Fund's Shares will no longer trade on a stock exchange and shareholders will therefore have limited options to sell their shares outside of the Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the Fund's Shares.

As previously announced on November 15, 2024, the expiration date of the Repurchase Offer, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's depositary agent, indicated that 439,157 Shares (approximately 12% of the Fund's Shares outstanding as of November 15, 2024) were validly submitted for tender and not withdrawn. Since more than 5% of the Fund's outstanding Shares were validly submitted for tender, the Fund repurchased validly tendered Shares on a pro rata basis. However, the Fund accepted all Shares validly submitted for tender by stockholders who owned, beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than 99 Shares and who validly tendered all of their Shares, before pro rating Shares validly tendered by other stockholders. Consequently, approximately 42% of Shares validly submitted for tender were accepted for repurchase. On November 18, 2024, and subject to pro ration as applicable, validly tendered Shares were repurchased by the Fund at $9.80 per Share, the Fund's net asset value per Share determined as of 4:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 18, 2024 less the Repurchase Fee. Shares validly tendered and accepted will not be entitled to receive any Fund dividend or distribution with a record date on or after November 22, 2024. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide stockholders with current income and gains. None of the Fund, its investment adviser or its Board of Directors made any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering Shares in the Repurchase Offer. For client-specific information regarding the Repurchase Offer, please contact your broker or financial advisor, or in the case of registered stockholders, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., which is acting as the depositary agent in connection with the Repurchase Offer.

Title: ‘He’s been unbelievably helpful’ – Thomas Clarkson thanks Cian Healy for his assistance in ‘surreal’ week

Ireland's Thomas Clarkson during the Autumn Nations Series clash against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile Thomas Clarkson got to make his debut twice on Friday night, the Wicklow native able to get a feel for things when he came on as a temporary replacement when Finlay Bealham was in the sin-bin during the first half against Argentina before getting 28 minutes after half-time. At the end of this month, he’ll go back to Leinster as a fully-fledged Ireland international and his next task will be to force his way into the match-day squad for the biggest games when he’s competing with Tadhg Furlong and former France international Rabah Slimani. This week, his involvement will be impacted by the health of Furlong and Tom O’Toole and whether Andy Farrell reckons he did enough against Argentina to merit another go. Realistically, he’s fifth in line behind Furlong, Bealham, O’Toole and Oli Jager, but injuries have opened the door and the 24-year-old has shown he can cope at the highest level. Certainly, Farrell has challenged Clarkson and Sam Prendergast to build on their debuts. “It was a big old task for Tom Clarkson coming on, especially when it’s a game of collision-winning and they’re going to test you through the forwards. They’re a good scrummaging pack and I thought he did really well,” he said. “It’s not about one cap, is it? It’s what you do with that one cap and how hungry you are to kick on now to gain on that experience.” Clarkson is still listed as a ‘training panellist’ rather than a full squad member and he was due to leave the set-up once their pre-New Zealand camp in Portugal was complete. Then came a tap on the shoulder. “I wasn’t supposed to be kept on after Portugal so to be kept on and end up playing it was a bit crazy,” he said. “We were gyming on the Monday and the team was announced Tuesday morning, so he [Farrell] kind of gives lads a heads up about what they are doing. “So, he was like, ‘You are going to be involved, 24th man for the New Zealand game’ because obviously Tadhg had been in and out with a few niggles so I was half expecting it. “It was either me or Jack Boyle because they normally take a tighthead so I kind of had a rough idea but he confirmed it there before we left. “I’m delighted and obviously incredibly grateful to the staff that they put a bit of trust in me it was a great day for me and my family and everyone else. “It was a bit surreal, like coming out for the anthem, it hadn’t been that full for the warm-up and then coming out and the fact it was dark as well so that added an extra bit. I had a big family there for the day. I think it was 10 so it was class. “I was still pretty nervous coming on [the second time]. “I wasn’t expecting 30 minutes as well so I was just trying to just make sure I was going at it from the start. Probably blew my load a little at the start, I was running around like a headless chicken there for the first 20 minutes, the last 10 I kind of died a little. “But I suppose that’s what you might expect, first cap.” Clarkson, whose grandfather Tony worked on the Irish Independent Sports desk and remains one of his biggest fans, began playing rugby at Wicklow RFC before attending Blackrock College. A talented swimmer who competed for national titles in the butterfly at U-12s, he is a dual national with an Italian mother and Irish father. He played alongside Ryan Baird, Harry Byrne and Craig Casey on the Grand Slam-winning 2019 U-20s team and was part of the 2022 Emerging Ireland squad, but he’s had to be patient at Leinster where he’s been involved in one Champions Cup game to date. Making the step up to international rugby was big, but Clarkson says Cian Healy was a huge help in settling him down in the build-up as he prepared to make his own milestone appearance. “He has been unbelievably helpful,” he said of the 133-cap veteran prop. “Just, sitting down watching training every day, making sure I understand, because I didn’t really get that many reps during the week because there was only two tightheads training. “He sat down with me and made sure I understood everything he was doing so I could do the same thing.”

Short bitcoin investment products saw inflows of US$49m. Full report: https://t.co/W1BDGvhJ3B pic.twitter.com/45YkiVTOyV — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) November 18, 2024 CoinShares tracks funds around the world that give investors exposure to digital coins and tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Europe and Asia. “This recent surge in [investing] activity appears to be driven by a combination of looser monetary policy and the Republican party’s clean sweep in the recent U.S. elections,” the report said. It added that most of the money was focused on U.S.-listed spot ETFs, giving sophisticated and retail investors exposure to Bitcoin. Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), approved 11 new spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The funds—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to small-timers using their phones the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in a streamlined and regulated way. Following Donald Trump’s White House win earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price has surged to new highs above $93,000—partly driven by investors buying into the American ETFs. CoinShares’ report added that enthusiasm around Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset, also surged: $646 million hit products, giving investors exposure to the coin last week. Since the Republican presidential victory on November 8, money has flowed into the crypto space. The week before, investors put nearly $2 billion into crypto funds. President-elect Trump has promised to help the digital asset industry, making various promises on the campaign trail.

Title: Canadian pension funds exposed as battery maker Northvolt struggles to survive

Time Published: 2024-11-18T23:22:31Z
Full Content:
Workers walk at the site of the Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, north Sweden on Feb. 23, 2022.JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images Several Canadian pension funds have sizable financial exposure in the event of a bankruptcy filing by Northvolt AB, the Swedish battery maker that is burning through cash as growth in demand for electric vehicles lags expectations. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Investment Management Corp. of Ontario (IMCO), Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec participated in US$2.3-billion in convertible debt financings for Stockholm-based Northvolt, joining major automakers and financial institutions to support the European battery hope as its future looked bright. OMERS also bought an undisclosed number of Northvolt shares in 2021. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Northvolt is considering seeking protection from creditors in the coming days after talks about a rescue package collapsed. The company is still trying to secure short-term financing, but time is getting short, the FT said, quoting unnamed people involved in the negotiations. Northvolt has suffered this year as EV demand growth slowed and a US$2.15-billion battery order was cancelled. In recent months, it has cut a fifth of its staff and shelved many of its expansion plans. Meanwhile, the fate of a $7-billion factory planned for Quebec has yet to be decided. Northvolt said little about its current predicament when contacted by The Globe and Mail on Monday. “Financing negotiations are ongoing,” Northvolt spokesperson Emmanuelle Rouillard-Moreau said in an e-mail. “We are maintaining close communication with our investors and key partners. We will share updates and the outcome of these discussions once decisions have been finalized.” The terms of Northvolt’s convertible debt – including under what circumstances it would be swapped for equity – have not been disclosed, which makes it hard to gauge where the four Canadian pension funds rank in terms of seniority in the event of a bankruptcy, or how much of their initial investments are at risk of being wiped out. Lenders typically rank ahead of equity owners when a company is restructured. Northvolt’s ownership group also includes some of the biggest automotive and financial names, such as Volkswagen AG VWAGY, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Goldman Sachs. The latter was said to be leading ill-fated rescue-package talks that were aimed at securing a reported US$300-million. The total exposure among the Canadian pension funds is murky, making it difficult to glean the precise values of the funds’ investments from public disclosures. The four pension-fund managers participated in a series of debt issues in 2023, including a US$400-million investment from IMCO. CPPIB invested US$55-million, while OMERS and BlackRock Inc., which is the world’s largest asset manager, also participated as Northvolt expanded its existing US$1.1-billion convertible debt program to US$2.3-billion. In November, 2023, the Caisse took on US$150-million in convertible debt. OMERS was an earlier backer of the battery maker and has made three investments, starting with the purchase of an undisclosed stake in a US$2.75-billion private placement of equity alongside a host of other investors, including Swedish pension funds, Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen. OMERS has not disclosed the size of its equity position. Spokespeople for OMERS, CPPIB, IMCO and the Caisse all declined to comment beyond confirming investments that were publicly announced. In September, Northvolt announced it was cutting its Swedish work force by 1,600 and suspending a number of its expansion projects. It retreated from its growth strategy as automakers such as General Motors Co. GM-N, Ford Motor Co. F-N, Volvo Car AB VOLVF and Volkswagen tempered their EV outlooks and spending to deal with high capital costs and some resistance among car buyers, who face sticker shock and still-spotty charging infrastructure. In June, BMW cancelled a US$2.15-billion order for Northvolt battery cells. All of this turmoil has raised questions about the Quebec plant, which has been awarded billions of dollars in loans and production incentives from the federal and Quebec governments. Northvolt has said that it is conducting a strategic review of the facility in Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Que., and results are expected in the coming weeks.

Title: Tokenization’s Tailwinds: Payment Networks and Real-World Assets
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2024/tokenization-tailwinds-payment-networks-real-world-assets/
Time Published: 2024-11-18T22:03:32Z

No matter the application, the guiding principle behind tokenization remains the same: replacing sensitive data with a digital representation (token) that protects that data. Recent weeks and months have seen the rise of what we might term two “tracks” of tokenization. There’s payment tokenization, and then there’s the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The former protects card-level details and the cardholder through a digital representation of the 16-digit card details that is without value. The latter streamlines the transfer of assets, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, between parties. Mastercard, for example, plans to phase out the need to enter card numbers, static passwords and one-time codes when making online purchases by the end of the decade through tokenization and biometric authentication. The company’s tokenization technology has reduced cart abandonment and increased transaction approvals by 3 to 6 percentage points, while also minimizing the risk of fraud, as 30% of the payments network’s transactions are tokenized. During Visa’s most recent earnings call Oct. 29, management said more than 30% of the firm’s transactions are tokenized, and Visa has issued more than 11.5 billion tokens. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Tokenization Innovation Report: The Future of Security and Personalization” found that 78% of merchants enable network or payment tokens. Larger merchants are more familiar with tokenization. Eighty percent of merchants generating $10 million to $50 million in annual revenue are “very or extremely familiar” with payment data tokenization solutions, more than the corresponding 35% of those generating $1 million to $5 million and 14% of those generating less than $1 million in annual revenue. Another 97% of payment service providers use network tokens to provide digital wallet payments. The growing awareness of tokenization comes as roughly two-thirds of merchants said they had experienced payments fraud; more than three-quarters said they had seen at least some online transactions fail, per the report. Total tokenized market capitalization could reach $2 trillion by 2030, McKinsey estimated. Last month, Visa debuted its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), which allows banking partners “to create and experiment with their own fiat-backed tokens in a VTAP sandbox.” In an initial use case, the platform enabled the issuance, transfer and redemption of a bank token on a blockchain, along with interactions of the token with smart contracts. Last week, Tether launched its own RWA tokenization platform, dubbed Hadron, which lets users “tokenize anything, anywhere,” including everything from stocks to loyalty points. In March, BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The company said last week that it expanded the offering, “by enabling BUIDL to be used within leading blockchain-based financial products and infrastructure across ecosystems.” In another example, Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree in February to explore the tokenization of private markets. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crypto boom 'more than just a fad'

Time Published: 2024-11-18T21:46:00Z

The crypto boom following the US election has pushed the price of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, to a new all-time high of more than 3 million baht, say industry executives. The surge in crypto prices after the US election is more than just a fad, indicating a major shift in the global financial system amid political and policy changes that are having a wide impact, said Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance. A combination of favourable policies, institutional acceptance and technological developments are laying the foundation for a new financial system, he said. "We are at a critical turning point. The growth of the crypto market is not just about price, but a fundamental change in the way we manage and access financial services. This change will affect all sectors of the global economy and will determine the future of the financial system for the next decade," Mr Nirun said. Peerapat Hankongkaew, chief investment officer of Cryptomind Advisory, said president-elect Donald Trump has a policy to make Bitcoin the national reserve currency of the US. When that policy takes root, Bitcoin will again set a new record high price, he said. "Investing in Bitcoin now would be worthwhile to capitalise on the long-term trend," said Mr Peerapat. Bitcoin may be an asset to protect itself from inflation. In addition, the increasing demand has caused the price to rise even higher. "If the US can make Bitcoin a reserve currency, other countries will have to follow," he said. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) that takes about 20 years to reach a value of US$30 billion, but investing in the Bitcoin ETF took only one year to reach a value of $30 billion, said Mr Peerapat. He said over the long term, Bitcoin can maintain its bull run. "The increase is just starting and now is the time to buy," said Mr Peerapat. "Bitcoin is seen as a store of wealth. It is a new asset that can substitute for money. The amount to invest in Bitcoin should match your level of knowledge of the cryptocurrency." Speculation on Bitcoin after the US election drove the price to surpass $91,000 on Nov 14. "This market movement is not just about price, but a structural change in the financial ecosystem that will determine the future of the global financial system," said Mr Nirun. "Financial institutions are making major adjustments to meet growing customer demand and business opportunities. We are seeing a clearer convergence between traditional and digital finance, driven by policy and institutional acceptance," he said. "This reshuffle signals a clear recognition of the role of crypto at the policy level. We expect to see the development of a more pro-innovation legal and regulatory framework, while maintaining a focus on investor protection and system stability." The development of technological infrastructure, the creation of new products and services, and the development of personnel with expertise in digital assets are occurring rapidly in the financial sector. These changes will help increase efficiency and reduce costs in the overall financial system. In terms of investment product development, the industry is starting to see the rise of more sophisticated financial instruments, such as digital asset-based ETFs, derivatives and structured products that combine digital and traditional assets. These financial innovations will increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market. The integration of traditional and digital financial markets is accelerating, especially in terms of infrastructure, payment systems and risk management. Leading financial institutions around the world are investing heavily in blockchain technology and digital systems to support the growth of the digital asset market, he said. "The future of capital markets will be a seamless integration of traditional and digital systems. This shift will affect the allocation of capital worldwide, especially in emerging markets that may benefit from easier access to funds, lower transaction costs and increased fundraising efficiency," said Mr Nirun.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

Title: Is Rio Tinto Group (RIO) the Best Nickel Stock to Invest in?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nickel Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stands against other best nickel stocks to invest in. Investing News Network highlighted that Nickel witnessed strong price momentum in H1 of the year as the prices took support from investor sentiment and speculation throughout commodity markets which saw a surge in prices for precious and base metals. Nickel prices remained volatile during Q3 2024 due to market speculation, Chinese stimulus, and oversupply. Among the contributing factors was the supply of laterite nickel out of Indonesia, which led to mine curtailments in New Caledonia, Australia, and Europe. Furthermore, the increased demand for battery production in China is yet to reach the levels required to make up for the increased supply. Despite the EV sector in China showing a YoY increase of 32% during the first 9 months of 2024, the industry's nickel demand was not able to make up for shortcomings in the broader economy. Nickel remains a critical component in NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, which are used in EVs. For the last few quarters, the market saw a significant oversupply of nickel from Asian markets, mainly from Indonesia. As per S&P Global, mined nickel production from the country saw an increase of 99,000 metric tons during Q3 2024 and is expected to be in the 2.4 million metric ton range by 2024-end, making up 57% of total global production. Despite growing demand for batteries, the oversupply situation has not been under control. This is mainly because of a weak Chinese economy. China has been tagged as the largest consumer of nickel in the world as a majority of the metal is being used in stainless steel production. However, a difficult real estate sector and broad economic deflation impacted the demand. Investing News Network went on to say that Nickel found pricing support in September, with the Chinese government rolling out stimulus measures focused on fueling economic growth. The measures also included a 0.5% cut to the mortgages and a reduction in the downpayment to buy a home to 15% from 25%. Even though there was an initial surge in nickel prices after the package, the prices retreated once again. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Despite the challenging market conditions, Nickel’s long-term demand in the EV industry is robust. According to EV Magazine, as automakers prioritize the high-nickel battery chemistries because of range and performance advantages, nickel consumption should be fueled as a result of the global shift toward electrification. As per Benchmark estimates, the battery nickel demand is expected to triple by the year 2030. Mid and high-level performance EVs are expected to fuel the growth of battery nickel demand in the coming years, mainly in Western markets. Benchmark projections demonstrate that nickel-based chemistries will capture 85% of battery cell production capacity outside of China by the year 2030. The batteries should make up for more than 50% of nickel demand growth by 2030, touching 1.5 million tonnes of nickel demand by the decade's end.

In order to compile a list of the 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now, we utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best virtual reality stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Average Upside Potential: 29.5% Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is a multinational mining and metals company, which is engaged in producing nickel and other minerals. Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s definitive agreements with GravitHy in a bid to ramp up the decarbonization of steelmaking in Europe. As a part of this collaboration, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) will supply high-grade direct reduction iron ore pellets from Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) operations to GravitHy’s planned operation, and manage the sales and marketing of ultra-low carbon Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) GravitHy produces. The steel produced with low-carbon emissions is a critical component of the net-zero energy transition. As per Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), the production of iron and steel contributes ~8% of global carbon emissions and needs new technologies, redesigned processes, and new infrastructure to decarbonize. This collaboration is aligned with Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s steel decarbonization strategy to ramp up the development of low-carbon Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking with high-grade iron as feedstock. This should enable Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and create valuable decarbonized pathways for high-grade iron ore. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) remains focused on its decarbonization efforts. In this regard, the company signed an MoU with China's Nanjing Iron and Steel Co. on decarbonization technology in ironmaking. Both firms would be exploring pelletizing using extracts from the Rio Tinto site in Pilbara, Western Australia. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) has moved from strategy to action on decarbonization and continues to make clear progress towards its climate targets: a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050. These alliances point to Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s decarbonization efforts, which should result in a reduction of carbon footprint and reach climate goals. Overall, RIO ranks 3rd on our list of best nickel stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of RIO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than RIO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Analyst Upside as of November 18, 2024: 29% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks that could 10x over the next three years. The semiconductor company makes chips for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. TSM attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its presence across the world. The company recently formed a joint venture with major partners in Germany and expanded its partnership with Amkor to facilitate advanced packaging in Arizona, fueling the semiconductor ecosystem in the region. In addition to that, the company expects to spend $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, allocated to advanced process technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and testing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) expects revenue from AI chips to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall TSM ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Energy Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) stands against the other promising energy stocks. In the next decade, global power demand is expected to grow by over 30%, largely fueled by economic growth in emerging markets and the electrification of various sectors. Data centers and artificial intelligence are becoming major energy consumers, increasingly relying on renewable sources like solar and wind power. Although efforts to improve energy efficiency may help mitigate some of this demand, the Asia-Pacific region is projected to account for a significant portion of the increase, capturing 66% of the total growth in electricity demand. In response to the rising demand, there is a strong focus on clean energy sources to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, as well as to qualify for tax incentives, reshaping the entire industry. Renewable energy is projected to increase by more than 740 gigawatts each year from now until 2035. By that year, carbon-free resources, including renewables, hydropower, nuclear energy, and battery storage, are expected to make up 70% of the total installed generation capacity. This shift is also driving significant investments and various initiatives across the industry. This includes renewable energy startups, traditional oil and gas companies, and associated manufacturing and technology firms. Investment in the energy transition is gaining momentum, with the US experiencing a 22% increase in 2023, reaching $303 billion. While this amount is substantial, it remains relatively small compared to the global total of $1.77 trillion. Read Also: 7 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now and 13 Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the United States, fossil fuels and nuclear power together account for 75% of energy production, while renewables contribute just under 25%. On a global scale, renewable sources now represent 30% of electricity generation. Another emerging trend in the energy sector is the rise of mergers and acquisitions. According to Bloomberg, over $155 billion in deals were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, exceeding the total from the previous five quarters combined. As companies face challenging market and economic conditions, consolidation within the oil and gas industry, particularly among upstream, midstream, and oil field services companies, is expected to continue. Oil prices significantly influence the performance of energy stocks, leading to a volatile year for the sector. Stock prices have fluctuated in response to changing oil prices. Despite this volatility, there are still investment opportunities within the energy sector, including traditional oil and gas companies, midstream businesses, and firms focused on renewable energy. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the 10 most promising energy stocks according to hedge funds. To shortlist the 10 most promising energy stocks, we used stock screeners like Yahoo Finance and Finviz to identify the largest energy companies. From there, we refined our selections to 10 stocks based on hedge fund sentiment using our database of 912 top hedge funds as of Q2 2024. The most promising energy stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them. Note: Although the theme of the article is Oil and Gas stocks, we've also added renewable energy stocks since many oil and gas companies are also diversifying in renewable energy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73 Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is a US-based independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production, purchase, transport, and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas on a global scale. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) has kept a steady dividend payment record since 1987. Recently, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, marking a 14.3% increase from the previous dividend. The company is set to be acquired by Chevron (NYSE:CVX) for $53 billion. This acquisition aligns with the broader trend of major energy companies expanding their shale oil production footprint in the United States. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shareholders will receive 1.025 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares for each of their Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) shares, making the deal attractive for investors. The company’s stock has been rated a “Moderate Buy.” Bailard Inc. was the leading hedge fund investor in the company as of Q2 2024, with a stake worth over $2.5 million. Overall HES ranks 5th among the most promising energy stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of HES as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Read Also: 7 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now and 13 Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks To Buy. In the United States, fossil fuels and nuclear power together account for 75% of energy production, while renewables contribute just under 25%. On a global scale, renewable sources now represent 30% of electricity generation. Another emerging trend in the energy sector is the rise of mergers and acquisitions. According to Bloomberg, over $155 billion in deals were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, exceeding the total from the previous five quarters combined. As companies face challenging market and economic conditions, consolidation within the oil and gas industry, particularly among upstream, midstream, and oil field services companies, is expected to continue. Oil prices significantly influence the performance of energy stocks, leading to a volatile year for the sector. Stock prices have fluctuated in response to changing oil prices. Despite this volatility, there are still investment opportunities within the energy sector, including traditional oil and gas companies, midstream businesses, and firms focused on renewable energy. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the 10 most promising energy stocks according to hedge funds. To shortlist the 10 most promising energy stocks, we used stock screeners like Yahoo Finance and Finviz to identify the largest energy companies. From there, we refined our selections to 10 stocks based on hedge fund sentiment using our database of 912 top hedge funds as of Q2 2024. The most promising energy stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them. Note: Although the theme of the article is Oil and Gas stocks, we've also added renewable energy stocks since many oil and gas companies are also diversifying in renewable energy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:NEE) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Electric utilities were the top contributors for the quarter, with U.S. utilities NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and Public Services Enterprise Group (PEG) the lead performers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing. The regulator has initiated an inquiry into the licensing framework for satellite-internet providers to provide clear rules for potential operators in the country.

In Japan, multinational conglomerate Softbank has partnered with chipmaker NVIDIA in a partnership that aims to turn communication base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets. The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services. Softbank estimates a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.

Title: D&D: ‘Monster Manual’ Previews Hidden In The Free Adventures

Time Published: 2024-11-18T17:52:48Z

Trending Topics Follow BoLS Explore our other sites It won’t be out for a few months yet, but these Monster Manual previews, scattered in some of the new adventures, foretell things to come. The new 5.5E Monster Manual won’t be out for a few months yet. February is, at press time, not yet right around the corner. Which is a relief, because I’m finally getting the hang of September. But though time stands between you and the completion of the 5.5E core rulebook set (first printing), you can still catch a glimpse of what lies in store. Monster Manual previews are scattered throughout the books and adventures released so far. Scions of Elemental Evil, Uni and the Hunt for the Lost Horn, and the adventures included in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, as well as stat blocks in the Player’s Handbook, all point to what the new Monster Manual will be like. Here are a few things we’ve learned. First things first, Monsters in 5.5E look a lot like they did in 5E. The wheel hasn’t been reinvented; it’s just had its numbers crunched a bit more. At least, that’s what they say. I haven’t actually done a number crunch myself. Every time I think of the phrase “number crunch,” my brain just sort of short circuits to WoW Guild Pals For Life’s seminal video about a man who returns from being AFK to grab some chicken, which came out 19 years ago now. But we’re not here to see what happens when Blackrock Whelps overwhelm a party. We’re here to talk about the Monster Manual previews sprinkled throughout the adventures. One of the first lessons we learn is all about mages and other magic-using enemies. And that is the return and evolution of the “magic attack” from Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse. In Hunt for the Lost Horn, we see the Mage, a new CR 6 NPC that could potentially be an enemy or ally NPC spellcaster. It follows a familiar format. A unique “magic attack,” in this case an Arcane Burst, which is a ranged or melee spell attack that does 3d10 damage and can be made three at a time thanks to its multiattack feature. The mage also has a handful of spells, including Fireball and Cone of Cold. Another quick lesson we learn from the same adventure is that some previous things like Pack Tactics seem to have been folded into the attacks themselves. It’s like weapon mastery properties but for monsters. Take the Worg from the same adventure. It has a Bite Attack. But an innate part of the bite attack is that the next attack roll made against a target bitten by a Worg has advantage. It’s no longer a separate trait DMs are likely to forget. It’s a subtle change, but one I think makes Monsters a bit more dynamic and interesting. Another thing we see is a lot more monsters with ranged attacks. The Bugbear Warrior, featured in Scions of Elemental Evil comes with a Light Hammer. Ignore for now that Light Hammer is an awful name for a weapon. Because while it’s a bad name, the hammer can be thrown or used in a grapple. Sometimes, though, your enemies will roll up armed with a brace of pistols. Take the Pirate Captain out of Scions of Elemental Evil. They can just shoot you with a pistol as much as they like (up to three times per round). Each shot does 2d10 + 4 damage on a hit. They get to ignore the Loading property of a pistol. But if that bothers you as a DM, don’t worry. You can just say it’s a brace of pistols and determine when they run out. D&D being the way it is, they’ll be dead before they can make more than a handful of attacks. But this is a trend we see a lot of: monsters with multiple attacks and multiple modes of attack. I think monsters may feel a little more dynamic overall. The DM may have more options for monsters to use to adapt to the unfurling situation of combat. Look for the Monster Manual in February 2025!

That’s what the hedge fund legend said in an interview last month, and it's part of why he's long been an outspoken Bitcoin bull. And Tudor Jones walks the walk, too: His hedge fund has massively upped its exposure to “digital gold” via the largest Bitcoin ETF in the United States. A new 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week shows that Tudor Investment Corporation held over 4.4 million shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), as of September 30. That stash was worth about $160 million at the time, but is now valued at $230 million at the current price. Back in June, the hedge fund held just 869,565 shares of the ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now allows more traditional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin via its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. An ETF is a popular investment vehicle allowing people to buy shares that track an underlying asset—which could be anything from foreign currency and gold to U.S. equities or copper. The SEC in January approved Bitcoin ETFs, allowing them to trade on stock exchanges and opening the doors to a new class of crypto investors. BlackRock’s ETF has received the biggest inflows and day-to-day trading action. Jones, who has spoken about Bitcoin for years, earlier this month said that he thought the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was a good bet because of increasing U.S. federal debt. He added that gold and commodities were also what he’s favored for his portfolio as of late. “I think all roads lead to inflation,” he said in a CNBC interview. “I’m long gold, I’m long Bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously underowned—so I’m long commodities.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Home completions have jumped nearly five-fold in a decade, Glenageary in south Dublin has the highest average monthly rent in the State while the average price paid for a property in Dublin is now over €600,000. These are just of some housing data points contained the Central Statistics Office’s (CSO) new housing hub, described by the agency as a “one-stop shop” for key information about the sector. “The purpose of this new housing hub is to collate statistics on housing in Ireland from the CSO and other public sector organisations in one easy to find location,” the agency said. It comes as housing emerges as the main political issue in the general election campaign with parties presenting different policies for dealing with the crisis. The CSO denied the launch had anything to do with the election though, noting the hub “has been in development for months and has been on our online release calendar since mid-September”. The CSO said its new resource provided a range of information, broken down into four main themes: home building; home prices and rents; cost of building homes; and housing features. It showed the top 10 highest average monthly rents were all located in Dublin, with Glenageary being the highest at €2,808 followed by Sandymount (€2,654), Dalkey (€2,651), Booterstown (€2,549), Ballsbridge (€2,523), Sandycove (€2,506), Clonskeagh (€2,497), Pembroke (€2,482), Blackrock (€2,455) and Killiney (€2,439). The most expensive area outside Dublin was Greystones, Wicklow (€2,155) followed by Bishoptown, Cork (€1,912) and Castletroy, Limerick (€1,849). The hub also indicated that the average or mean price paid for a home nationally in the 12 months to August this year was €419,893 while the average in Dublin was €613,492. The figures also show that in 2022 the population grew by 8 per cent while the State’s housing stock grew by 5 per cent. They also show that new dwelling completions rose from just 6,994 in 2011 to a post-crash high of 32,548 last year.

Title: 'I'm One Of You' – How 'Anti-Woke' Warrior Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire At Only 38

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Vivek Ramaswamy is a name making waves. Whether it's his stance against corporate "wokeness" or his ambitious political moves, people have started paying attention to him. But behind all the headlines, Ramaswamy has an intriguing story: a child of Indian immigrants who turned his biotech gamble into a billion-dollar fortune – all by age 38. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett Flipped His Neighbor's $67,000 Life Savings Into A $50 Million Fortune — This Would Be Worth Over $500 Million Today Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Born to Indian immigrant parents, Vivek Ramaswamy grew up with a strong work ethic. Forbes reports his dad worked as an engineer and patent attorney while his mom was a psychiatrist. He didn't coast by in school – Ramaswamy graduated from Harvard with a biology degree and cofounded a startup that helped student founders pitch business ideas to investors. It wasn't a big moneymaker but gave him a taste of entrepreneurship. After Harvard, Ramaswamy worked at QVT, a hedge fund specializing in pharmaceutical investments. By 28, he had become a partner, earning about $7 million. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. At 29, Ramaswamy took a big swing. He left his hedge fund job to found Roivant Sciences (NASDAQ:ROIV), an investment company focused on rescuing abandoned drugs. His bet? That some forgotten treatments could still be worth billions. He was right. Just a year after founding Roivant, one of its subsidiaries, Axovant, went public with a valuation of $2.2 billion. Ramaswamy had bought the Alzheimer's drug that Axovant was based on for only $5 million. While that drug ultimately didn't work out, it didn't stop Ramaswamy from scoring big elsewhere. However, as Forbes writes, in 2020, a Japanese pharmaceutical company bought several of Roivant’s drugs for $3 billion. That sale alone made Ramaswamy an instant multimillionaire. By then, he'd pulled in about $260 million in salary, bonuses and capital gains from Roivant. He invested his gains wisely, mostly in stocks and bonds and riskier bets like Bitcoin, ethereum and Rumble, a YouTube competitor. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share In 2021, Ramaswamy decided to switch gears. He stepped down as CEO of Roivant and focused on politics. He wrote a book called Woke, Inc., where he tore into corporate America’s focus on social justice and the environment. He argued that big companies forgot about making quality products and focused too much on "good PR." The book turned heads and put Ramaswamy on the map as a vocal critic of what he called "woke capitalism." Not long after, he launched Strive Asset Management, an "anti-woke" version of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), one of the largest asset managers in the world. Ramaswamy's firm encouraged businesses to focus on profits, not politics. Investors seemed to like it; Strive was recently valued at about $300 million. Heavy hitters like Peter Thiel, Bill Ackman and Joe Lonsdale even backed it, helping Ramaswamy grow his wealth further. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Ramaswamy has tried to position himself as a regular guy, unlike other wealthy figures. He's got two homes in Ohio worth $2.5 million combined, which may sound like a lot, but it’s far less than many other political figures. He insists that his lifestyle is modest compared to other rich people, though he does admit to owning stakes in three private jets. "If we could buy time, we would buy time. And that's the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family," he says. See Also: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you. During a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a woman thanked him, a billionaire, for visiting the "cow-town people." Ramaswamy smiled and said, "I'm one of you." He's not, of course – and that might be part of the appeal. People see someone who took big risks, succeeded and isn't apologizing for his wealth. Now, Ramaswamy is stepping even deeper into public life. Recently, President-elect Donald Trump appointed him and Elon Musk as coheads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new initiative to cut government waste and slash regulations.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) stands against the other immunotherapy stocks. The global immunotherapy drugs market is rapidly expanding, with projections to grow from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2033. The growth is driven by the global rise in chronic diseases such as different types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Cancer, particularly is becoming more prevalent among people globally. The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, which highlights the increasing burden of cancer worldwide. In 2022 alone, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease. By 2050, annual cancer cases are expected to reach 35 million, driving demand for innovative treatments like immunotherapy. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to traditional therapies, and its applications are expanding as research advances. It can be applied to various types of cancer, either alone or alongside treatments like chemotherapy. Immunomodulating agents, a type of non-specific immunotherapy, help improve the body’s immune system's capability of detecting and attacking cancer cells.

Due to the growing demand for treatments, leading pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in research and development to expand the range of immunotherapy drugs available. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. Combining different therapies and tailoring treatments to individual patients is helping to unlock new applications for immunotherapy, positioning it to revolutionize cancer care and other areas of medicine. North America led the global immunotherapy drugs industry in 2023, capturing over 48.19% of total revenue, driven by medical advancements and regulatory approvals, particularly in the US. The FDA's approval of immunotherapy for cancers with specific genetic traits, regardless of origin, highlights the region's leadership in innovative treatments like tumor-agnostic therapies. With over 2 million new cancer cases expected in the US in 2024, demand for effective treatments like immunotherapy will continue to grow. Organizations such as Canada’s National Research Council are also developing new immunotherapies, aiming to provide hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers like B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We selected stocks from ETFs with immunotherapy exposure and narrowed down the list to the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The hedge fund sentiment has been sourced from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A research facility with medical professionals surrounded by diagnostic equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading genomics company that provides advanced tools for analyzing DNA and RNA. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) plays a key role in advancing immunotherapy research, particularly through its next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These tools help scientists study the mechanisms by which tumors evade the immune system and identify therapeutic targets that could boost immune responses against cancer. Wall Street analysts and investors are optimistic about Illumina, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ILMN) future, especially after the Grail spin-off in 2024 and the acquisition of Fluent Biosciences to improve its single-cell analysis and multiomics capabilities. In Q2, Illumina exceeded expectations, achieving Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and operating margins of 22.2%, supported by steady progress on its strategic goals. The stock has received a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy.” Here’s what Patient Capital Management said about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a good example. We entered the name late last year as the company began to trade at a 5-yr low. The company is a leader in the genomic sequencing space but made an ill-advised acquisition of Grail, a blood-based multi-cancer early detection product, in 2021 for $8B dollars. Grail was an annual ~$600m drag on profitability hitting the financials at the same time that competition began to pick up and the overall demand environment began to weaken. Despite increased competition in the genome sequencing space, Illumina continues to be a leader with ~80% market share today. With the successful separation of Grail Inc. (GRAL) in June, Illumina has now returned to a pure-play sequencing company. As the company returns to historical profitability post Grail spin-off and as the demand environment normalizes post COVID, we believe you can buy a market leader in a secularly growing industry for less than a market multiple.” Overall ILMN ranks 5th on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ILMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ILMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: There are 'no natural sellers' in stocks: BlackRock's Rick Rieder

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. “There are no natural sellers,” Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He’s the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. “I think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.” Second, “The technicals are crazy for equities,” Rieder said. That’s in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. "Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations," he said. "We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years." Of course, that’s not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited “animal spirits” in the market. “I think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,” Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed, and in addition to that, a lot of deregulation. So we're upping our estimates for what profit margins are going to be doing over the next couple of years.” Rieder and Stoltzfus agree that a far-off potential risk for stocks and the economy more broadly could be the ballooning of the US deficit and debt, and a possible resultant buyers' strike in the Treasury market that could send yields higher. However, markets aren’t concerned at the moment. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rieder said. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026 unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and, then obviously, inflation relative to that.” Last week showed euphoria was dampened but perhaps not eliminated. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, falling 2.1%. That also means it closed 2.1% below its record high of 6,001.35, a level that could be quickly surpassed if the “animal spirits” that Yardeni invoked reassert themselves.

Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have surged to become some of the fastest-growing ETFs of all-time following their January debut and led by BlackRock's $42 billion bitcoin fund, could be about to be approved for options trading after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an advisory notice. "[I]n light of relevant precedents in the courts, it is substantially likely these spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities," a CFTC spokesperson wrote. "Therefore, [the Division of Clearing and Risk's] DCR position is the listing of these shares on [Security and Exchange Commission] SEC-registered national securities exchanges does not implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options by OCC would be undertaken in its capacity as a registered clearing agency subject to SEC oversight." Bitcoin spot ETF options were given the green light by the U.S. SEC in September when BlackRock's proposal to list and trade options for its IBIT fund was approved, with the CFTC notice the "second hurdle they needed to clear," according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas.

November 18, 2024 08:15 ET | Source: Watershed Watershed SAN FRANCISCO, CA & LONDON, UK, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watershed, the enterprise sustainability platform, announced today that it has facilitated the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) on behalf of customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block. The purchases, coordinated with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), will add high-integrity sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) directly to Alaska Airlines passenger flights, and the SAFc will be applied to the companies’ corporate footprints to compensate for business travel emissions. This investment supports the production and use of SAF, an emerging climate technology for air travel. The purchases are part of SABA’s largest-ever collection of deals, announced in April 2024: commitments expected to result in $200M of SAFc worth roughly 50 million gallons of SAF, or 500,000 tonnes of abated CO2e over the next five years. Watershed is an aggregator partner of SABA, which accelerates investment in, and adoption of, sustainable aviation fuel. With this purchase, Watershed customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block are participants in SABA. “We see collective engagement in the SAF market as a compelling demand signal,” said Claire Kiely, Head of Watershed Marketplace Carbon Supply. “Watershed consolidates our customers’ demand for high-impact, low-carbon technology like sustainable aviation fuel, then works with SAF suppliers, airlines, and experts through SABA to meet that demand and grow an essential new sector. By participating in this historic investment, Watershed customers are providing a powerful demand signal for SAF and affirming the role SAFc will play in corporate emissions reduction initiatives.” “Alaska Airlines is all-in on advancing the market for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical element in the path to decarbonize aviation,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Alaska Airlines. "We are one of the founding members of SABA’s Aviators group because we know that we will only reach our destination if we’re tackling this challenge from all angles–business, policy, financing, and more. Investing in SAF alongside partners like Watershed, BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block helps us scale up use and provides critical demand signals for the market. We’re grateful for their leadership and partnership, and look forward to even more collaboration as they join SABA." “Aggregator partners like Watershed play a pivotal role in helping accelerate the growth of green commodity markets. By consolidating demand among its customers, Watershed is helping SABA send a larger demand signal to the SAF market while enabling us to welcome a new set of leading corporations. SAFc purchases from BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block further our efforts to decarbonize the future of flight,” said Kim Carnahan, Head of SABA’s Secretariat and CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation. "Ripple remains committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and joining the push for sustainable aviation fuel is an important step in our journey to net-zero carbon by 2030,” said Ken Weber, VP of Social Impact & Sustainability at Ripple. “We’re thrilled to work with SABA, Watershed, and alongside other leading organizations to help advance the most promising, scalable climate positive energy solutions. We see sustainable aviation fuel as a key pathway toward decarbonizing air travel, a vital global industry, and through collaboration with Watershed and SABA we are not only supporting the growth of SAF, but also empowering other companies to take similar meaningful steps in reducing their emissions footprint.” SAF is made with renewable or waste feedstocks. It can be used in today's aircraft without investments to upgrade existing fleets and infrastructure, and can significantly reduce the carbon emissions from flights. SAF purchased through the SABA transaction will achieve, on average, an 80% reduction in carbon intensity relative to conventional jet fuel. While the industry is growing rapidly, SAF still makes up less than 0.5% of global jet fuel supply and today sells at a premium compared to fossil jet fuel. To scale and meet its full potential, the nascent SAF sector needs both market support—through strong corporate demand and investment—and robust infrastructure. SABA’s book and claim model is designed to set up intentional, high-integrity market infrastructure for the long term. In addition to pooling corporate demand for SAF purchasing, SABA has put in place tracking, registry, and reporting mechanisms that validate SAF as a carbon dioxide reduction commodity. ### ABOUT WATERSHED: Watershed is the enterprise sustainability platform. Companies like Airbnb, Carlyle Group, FedEx, Visa, and Dr. Martens use Watershed to manage climate and ESG data, produce audit-ready metrics for voluntary and regulatory reporting including CSRD, and facilitate real decarbonization. Watershed is the platform of choice for companies seeking to reduce emissions, meet customer, investor and regulatory requirements, and modernize their sustainability programs. Watershed customers also have exclusive access to a marketplace of pre-vetted, high-quality carbon projects and groundbreaking virtual power purchase agreements.

Title: ‘Dying A Slow Death’: Has Ethereum Lost Wall Street’s Favor To Bitcoin?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2024/11/18/dying-a-slow-death-has-ethereum-lost-wall-streets-favor-to-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-11-18T12:51:05Z
Full Content:
Blackrock Ethereum has broken an eight-year support trend against Bitcoin, raising questions about the second-largest cryptocurrency’s future. “Dying a slow death”—that’s how Tuur Demeester, founder of Bitcoin hedge fund Adamant Capital, described Ethereum, pointing to the broken trendline to a canary in the coal mine. Crypto analysts blame Ethereum’s setback on slow institutional adoption, where Bitcoin continues to dominate. This could have deeper implications for Ethereum’s positioning as an asset class. Ethereum’s struggles come during a mixed week for the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s price is flat Monday, hovering around the $90,000 mark, while Ethereum has dropped 0.3% to $3,080. Altcoins are a mixed bag: Solana is up 4.6%, Dogecoin is flat, XRP has gained 7.2%, BNB is down 2.3%, and Cardano is up 2.9%. According to Kaiko, a crypto data firm, Bitcoin’s dominance over Ethereum is due to its superior adoption among institutional investors, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The disparity became more evident with the launch of crypto ETFs—with Bitcoin ETFs drawing significantly higher trading volumes than Ethereum ETFs. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs garnered more than $47 billion in assets within their first 30 days, while Ethereum ETFs brought in just over $6.7 billion, according to Amberdata, a crypto analytics firm. “The divergence in performance and on-chain activity can also be attributed to the distinct value propositions of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Amberdata noted in a recent report. “Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ has a simple and well-defined narrative as a store of value and inflation hedge, thanks in part to its fixed supply of 21 million BTC.” Bitcoin benefits from its fixed supply and simpler use case. Ethereum—though more versatile—suffers from scalability challenges and regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding its transition to a proof-of-stake model. The divide extends to institutional endorsement. Bitcoin ETFs have already earned their name on Wall Street. For example, earlier this year, Fidelity added Bitcoin ETFs to 401(k) plans, while Morgan Stanley allowed its financial advisors to recommend these ETFs to clients. Ethereum, by contrast, has not received as much institutional backing. Even the best-performing Ethereum funds lag behind Bitcoin in terms of adoption and media attention, according to Amberdata. Demeester’s remark may be a bit of a stretch, but it reflects growing concerns about Ethereum’s positioning as an alternative asset class. To regain its edge, experts argue that Ethereum must address scalability issues and redefine its role as a technology-driven asset rather than competing directly with Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Until then, institutional dollars appear to favor Bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Representing tangible and intangible assets like real estate and private credit digitally on blockchains, RWAs are redefining asset ownership by enabling fractional ownership and boosting liquidity. This innovation is reshaping global finance, offering retail and institutional investors more accessible and diversified portfolios. FBS analysts emphasize the significant advantages of RWAs, including reduced barriers to entry, streamlined operations, and democratized access to high-value assets. The surge in adoption is evident, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where institutions like BlackRock and UBS are integrating tokenized assets into their offerings. These advancements highlight the role of RWAs in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, addressing inefficiencies and expanding global market participation. However, FBS also notes the challenges that come with this innovation. Scalability, regulation, and the need for robust blockchain infrastructure are key hurdles. FBS analysts suggest that as technology advances, solutions to these challenges will further solidify RWAs as a cornerstone of future financial ecosystems. For traders, understanding the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market is critical, offering new opportunities to align with emerging trends. Tokenization offers the potential to unlock trillions of dollars in otherwise inaccessible assets, broadening their availability to a wider audience. This innovation is reshaping industries like real estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property. By integrating RWAs into the global economy, tokenization is driving changes in asset management, trading practices, and portfolio diversification strategies. FBS analysts highlight the importance of keeping a close eye on the tokenized asset space. By staying informed about regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market trends, traders and investors can strategically position themselves to capitalize on this transformative wave. RWAs represent a significant evolution in financial systems, marking a shift toward a more inclusive and efficient global financial ecosystem. FBS remains committed to equipping traders with actionable insights and cutting-edge tools to navigate such dynamic shifts in the financial landscape.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 7 shareholders own 52% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Every investor in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.5% increase in the share price after a year of 33% losses as a sign that returns may to begin trending higher. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. Check out our latest analysis for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.
