While the populist consensus is that MAGA is killing off diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in corporate America, that may not always be the case in some of the nation’s biggest companies. According to one report, shareholders of some leading companies, including Costco, Apple, Levi’s, John Deere, Goldman Sachs, and others, have voted against proposals targeting DEI programs. Those proposals included asking companies to ditch their DEI policies and examine the legal risks of pursuing them. Two conservative think tanks, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center, are reportedly behind most of the DEI-killing measures. In January, Breitbart News noted that Costco had dug in its heels after a shareholder proposal urged the “wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risk posed by its” DEI practices, according to AP. “‘But Costco’s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion,’ an AP report stated, noting their message to shareholders claimed that having a diverse workforce and suppliers resulted in greater customer satisfaction.” DEI in the workplace results in employee training, resource networks, and recruiting practices that advance representation of different races, genders, and classes, people with disabilities, veterans, and other groups. But opponents like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO, and President Donald Trump himself, say DEI is unfair to qualified workers and represents “reverse racism.” Dozens of companies, including Target and Meta, have dialed back or eliminated their diversity programs in recent months under pressure from the Trump administration. Opponents sometimes cite that DEI violates the spirit of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated racial preferences in college admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. But as Breitbart reported at the time, that decision only applies to state governments and institutions. Shareholder votes are where DEI opponents are losing, reported CNN Business. The rejections of anti-DEI proposals “reveal that the investor community doesn’t think that having a tough stance on DEI makes financial sense,” Matteo Gatti, a professor of law at Rutgers University who studies corporate governance, told the network. “Investors are saying they don’t want ideological shareholders to drive business.” That “community,” however, appears to be dominated by Wall Street’s big players. “Large institutional investors” apparently call the shots at many multinational corporations. Mega investors “such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the top shareholders of most companies. “They typically oppose outside shareholder resolutions,” the network reported, “siding with company management in around 90% of the votes.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Rhode-based Ivy League Institution Brown University disclosed in a recent regulatory filing that it is holding exposure to Bitcoin via BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares. This marks the first time the academic institution has sought exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Add Brown University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to Bitcoin. A new 13F-HR filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, worth roughly $4.9 million, as of March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed in the previous quarter’s filing. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is credited with rekindling the spot BTC ETF movement, after the SEC time and again rejected such products since 2013. These novel investment products give traditional investors access to Bitcoin without the hassle of buying and storing it themselves. Pundits believe the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marks one of the most successful financial product launches in history. Notably, IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with a staggering $57 billion in assets under management. It’s worth mentioning that Brown is not the first university to have exposure to Bitcoin. The University of Austin (UATX) partnered with Bitcoin services company Unchained in May 2024 to launch a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then, in October of the same year, Atlanta-based Emory University disclosed ownership of more than $14 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds, publicly listed companies, and nation states are racing to gain access to the apex crypto. The Bitcoin price soared above $97,500 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. The asset is currently trading hands at $96,170, according to data from CoinGecko.

The holdings report filed on Friday shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, valued around $4.9 million as of the first quarter’s end on March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed on the previous quarter’s filing. The shares are currently valued at about $5.8 million. While a significant investment, the position is just a drop in the bucket for an endowment that increased to more than $7.2 billion at the end of its 2024 fiscal year. “Over the past few decades, the financial markets have significantly increased in complexity, and as the value of the endowment has grown, Brown has adapted,” its 2024 endowment report reads. “Today, a team of professional investors pursues a diverse set of investment strategies that require high levels of expertise and investment acumen.” The university’s portfolio includes diversified holdings that include “investments in stocks, bonds, private companies, real estate, and commodities.” Brown is not the first university to seek exposure to Bitcoin. In May 2024, the University of Austin (UATX) collaborated with Bitcoin services company Unchained to create a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then in October, Atlanta’s Emory University reported nearly $16 million in Bitcoin exposure via the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Its most recently filed holdings report shows a reduction in shares, but around $22 million in Bitcoin exposure thanks to the asset’s price rise. It also showcases more than $1 million worth of shares in leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The trio of universities fit alongside a growing list of institutions—from publicly traded companies to world governments—that are racing to gain access to crypto’s largest asset by market cap. The price of Bitcoin neared $98,000 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. It's currently priced at $96,330.

Title: Elon Musk and His DOGE Bro Have Cashed In on Americans’ Retirement Savings

Full Content:
By Matthew Cunningham-Cook In the lead up to the April 1 election for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court, a little-known private equity executive by the name of Antonio Gracias joined Tesla billionaire Elon Musk on stage as the latter launched into a tirade clearly inspired by the white supremacist Great Replacement Theory — the discredited canard that the Biden administration was letting in millions of “illegals” to engage in mass voter fraud. On the dais, Gracias described how his foray into Social Security had revealed something already widely known to immigration policymakers: that the Biden administration had substantially expanded the Temporary Protected Status program, allowing millions of immigrants to enter and work in the country legally. These noncitizens were given Social Security numbers, as is completely standard — in fact, the process was automated during Trump’s first term — but Gracias and Musk, the world’s richest man, treated it like a scandal. “We started at the top of the system mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where the fraud was — this is what jumped out at us,” Gracias said. “When we saw these numbers, we asked ‘What is this?’ In ‘21, you see 270,000 people, it goes all the way to 2.1 million in ‘24. These are noncitizens that are getting Social Security numbers. … This literally blew us away. We went there to find fraud, and we found this by accident.” Noting that his parents and siblings, like Musk, are immigrants, Gracias added, “I’m pro-legal immigration — this is about America and the future of America.” The crowd of conservatives gasped as the billionaires made it sound as if they and their team at Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency had finally found proof of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Social Security Administration that Musk has repeatedly talked about — examples that might help justify the massive upheaval that DOGE has created within the agency that manages America’s core retirement program. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Under their watch, DOGE has moved to fire thousands of SSA workers, shutter dozens of field offices, and implement sweeping changes that are expected to make it more difficult for Social Security recipients to get their payments on time, if at all. The administration has reportedly declared millions of people dead within the Social Security program, making live people fight for their payments, and has started deliberately marking some immigrants as deceased. (A White House spokesperson says SSA’s “death data” is “being reviewed by three separate teams,” and that the immigrants targeted were either “on the terrorist watch list” or have “FBI criminal records.”) Meanwhile, Social Security beneficiaries may have to wait until November to receive the higher payments they were promised in a law passed last year. Despite all of Musk and Gracias’ rhetoric about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Social Security, scant attention has been paid to how the pair has become phenomenally wealthy with support from Americans’ retirement funds. It’s well-known that Musk’s space company, SpaceX, has long cashed in on federal contracts — a trend turbocharged by Trump’s administration. Gracias, for his part, has relied on significant investments from public retirement systems to fund his firm’s deals. In the past decade, Gracias’ private equity firm, Valor Equity Partners, has received at least $1.7 billion in investment commitments from state and local pension funds — which manage the retirement savings of unionized teachers, firefighters, social workers, bus drivers, and cops — according to a Rolling Stone review of public documents. Much of this money has come from Democratic states and locales. For its most recent fund, Valor received $800 million in investment commitments from a range of state and local pension funds. Investors include the California Public Employees’ Retirement System; the California State Teachers’ Retirement System; the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund; the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System; a range of New York City pension funds; the Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement; and the Hartford Municipal Employees Retirement Fund in Connecticut. Related Content Democrats Denounce Rubio Holding Four Roles in Trump Administration Trump White House Engages in 'Star Wars' Cosplay to Demonize Immigrants Trump Lies About Gas and Grocery Prices, Defends Tariffs Trump Says 'I Don't Know' When Asked if He Has to 'Uphold the Constitution' Valor disclosed in a press release last August that this same fund has invested in Musk’s SpaceX and his artificial intelligence company xAI. Musk recently used xAI to purchase his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) at a valuation of $33 billion, a 25-percent haircut from the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter. (The platform’s ad revenues have cratered under Musk’s stewardship.) With a typical management fee of two percent, Gracias’ firm stands to accumulate tens of millions of dollars annually from the public funds no matter how its investments perform. While Gracias complains about 1.3 million immigrants being on Medicaid — numbers that have not been independently verified by Rolling Stone, but would mean these immigrants are getting access to preventive care and saving hospitals money on emergency room expenses — Gracias himself is accruing large profits from the management fees that his firm charges government retirement systems. Valor and DOGE did not respond to Rolling Stone’s requests for comment. A 54-year-old University of Chicago Law School alum who has been associated with Musk since the PayPal days, Gracias has played a key role in helping prop up Musk’s embattled yet sprawling business empire. He’s a longtime investor in Musk’s companies, a significant Tesla shareholder, and former Tesla board member. Gracias’ longstanding friendship and business dealings with Musk have been lucrative for both men. Musk is worth an estimated $386 billion, in large part due to his Tesla holdings. Gracias has a net worth of $2.2 billion, much of it tied to his holdings of Tesla stock. Gracias lent Musk $1 million early in Musk’s ownership of Tesla, and his firm has invested in nearly every Musk company, including SpaceX. The Trump administration has been good to them. SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from government contracts, has raked in billions more under the Trump administration. Agencies across the federal government are increasingly using Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet business. SpaceX and defense contractor Anduril, another company that Gracias’ firm has invested in, are the frontrunners to build Trump’s proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield, a proposal that experts estimate will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In late April, the Wall Street Journal reported on Gracias’ lucrative side hustle — selling stakes in Musk’s private companies like SpaceX. A White House spokesperson says, “As for concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.” As Trump and Musk have run roughshod over the law to pursue drastic cuts of the federal government through DOGE, they have been supported by an eclectic cast of characters. While 19-year olds or those with openly racist proclivities or nicknames like “Big Balls” get the bulk of media attention, arguably nobody has been more important to implementing DOGE’s slash-and-burn agenda than Gracias. With his entry into the heights of Washington policymaking, Gracias, like Musk, has brought an overall mentality to the Trump administration with well-defined origins in private equity. Core to the history of private equity is a conception that government is a vehicle for private profit, and that the point of business is to extract as much cash as possible from targets, no matter the impact. Private equity started in earnest thanks to a rule change by Jimmy Carter in 1979 that allowed private equity to fundraise from private sector pension funds. (Public pension cash began to flow shortly thereafter.) But with the critical benefits of millions of Americans at issue, along with basic principles like the rule of law and a government that functions, the stakes couldn’t be higher. “It does seem like Musk and DOGE are applying private equity tactics to the government,” says Brendan Ballou, a former attorney at the Department of Justice who wrote the 2023 book Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America. As an example, Ballou notes, “They’re exploring sale leasebacks to sell underlying government property and lease it back to itself,” a hallmark of the private equity model. “They’re pursuing the same type of cost-cutting techniques that private equity firms pursue when they take over a company, which end up costing you vastly more money in the long run. Slashing the IRS might save you money for one year, but it’s devastating in the future. It’s almost comical how similar it is to the takeover of a company by a private equity firm, what they are doing to the government.” As Gracias is primed to reap a windfall from the Golden (no, not Teapot) Dome, the DOGE-led Social Security cuts he has helped to oversee could send the program cratering down the road to privatization — another classic hobbyhorse of a Wall Street eager to profit from the nearly $3 trillion in the Social Security Trust Fund that is currently invested in U.S. Treasuries. (BlackRock, whose CEO Larry Fink recently resuscitated the long-discredited idea of investing part of Social Security in Wall Street-controlled private accounts, did Musk a massive favor last year when the financial firm voted its investors’ proxies in favor of Musk’s record-setting $46 billion Tesla pay package.) Gracias began working with the Social Security Administration in early February. By the end of the month, the SSA had announced its intentions to cut 7,000 positions out of the agency’s 57,000-person workforce. Dozens of Social Security offices are expected to close, while DOGE pushes major technological changes that could make more people need to visit those offices. A White House spokesperson says SSA has only lost 2,000 workers so far, with most departing voluntarily, and adds that “the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office.” “President Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency to modernize government operations and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” the spokesperson continues. “At the Social Security Administration, the DOGE team has delivered — upgrading technology systems, implementing anti-fraud tools, improving the accuracy of death records, and stopping illegal aliens from collecting benefits. President Trump remains committed to always protecting Social Security.” Additionally, Gracias has reportedly led a DOGE task force working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to integrate sensitive personal data from Social Security, with the apparent goal of aiding Trump’s deportation dragnet. Speaking about DOGE’s efforts in the Social Security Administration, former SSA Commissioner Martin O’Malley said in March, “Most of the actions necessary to create a total system collapse of the Social Security Administration have been taken.” In late April, the Trump SSA pledged that they would seek to convert large swaths of SSA employees to “Schedule F,” which would effectively eliminate longstanding civil service protections and serve to speed up firings at the agency. DOGE appears to have been able to circumvent a federal judge’s March ruling barring its access to SSA data with Trump appointing one of DOGE’s own as chief information officer of the Social Security Administration. That role is currently being held by Scott Coulter, who used to work for private equity giant Blackstone and Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund, and has worked as a DOGE apparatchik. All of this is out of the private equity playbook, says Samir Sonti, a professor at the Murphy Institute at the City University of New York. “Private equity has profited immensely in recent decades off of asset stripping — using public resources to plunder businesses and communities, leaving behind carcasses of enterprises in many cases,” he says. “Fundamentally, private equity is really about devastating the public good for private gain. DOGE is executing something very similar at the federal level. But they’re gutting not just a specific enterprise or community but the entire federal government, to advance a longer-term desire among corporate interests in this country to free themselves from any public or social oversight. In many ways, what we’re seeing with DOGE is the private equity asset stripping model [taken] to its logical conclusion.” Private equity firms in the U.S. — anchored by big names Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, and KKR — manage over $3.1 trillion in assets, and control outright major firms like Medline, the largest medical supply firm in the U.S., and Allied Universal, the world’s largest private security firm. Companies owned outright by private equity firms employ over 12 million people in the U.S., according to research by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. Employees of private equity firms spent $236 million on campaign contributions in the 2024 election. The American Investment Council, a lobbying group for private equity, has estimated that about half of private equity’s capital that is invested in America comes from U.S. public pension funds. Private equity is distinguished by its lack of regulation, limited transparency, high fees, and vulnerability to misconduct. A leaked 2020 report from the FBI found that private equity firms, along with their closely related siblings in asset management, hedge funds, are widely used to conduct illicit money laundering operations. “Public pension funds are one of the biggest sources of capital for private equity firms,” says Oscar Valdés Viera, who analyzes private equity at Americans for Financial Reform. “Workers indirectly fund private equity’s predatory practices through their pension funds. The private equity billionaires benefit from tax loopholes and giveaways that the rest of us do not get,” he says, pointing out the carried interest tax deduction, which allows private equity managers to get much of their income taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate than the ordinary income tax rate. “They charge a lot of fees, like management fees, professional fees, director and officer fees, accounting fees, transfer agent fees, and most of these fees are coming directly from pension funds and similar investors,” he says. “It’s just insane the amount of fees that they charge from these pension funds.” Reflecting the broad secrecy of his industry, much of what Gracias is doing at DOGE remains closed off to the public eye. On April 21, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Social Security Administration for failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests related to its handling of the personal data of millions of Americans, stating: “The American people have an urgent need to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized by Trump’s unaccountable team of unvetted outsiders.” Trending Stories People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Lady Gaga Performs to Record-Breaking Crowd at Rio's Copacabana Beach Elon Musk: It Is ‘Outrageous’ to ‘Claim That I’m a Nazi’ Trump White House Engages in 'Star Wars' Cosplay to Demonize Immigrants Brett Christophers, a professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University who has studied asset management, tells Rolling Stone that the actions of DOGE clearly resemble foundational principles of the private equity industry. “When private equity investors go into operating companies, the most consistent theme across all their investments is cost cutting as a way in theory to maximize their investment and make companies lean and more valuable to other potential investors,” he says. “It sounds like what’s going on with DOGE is that Musk and the people working with him are trying to treat the government in the same way.” We want to hear it.

Title: Bitcoin set for $3B short squeeze! How it will fuel BTC’s $100K rally

Can institutional cash into IBIT rocket Bitcoin past $100K and into six-figure territory? Bitcoin [BTC] is on the brink of something big. With over $3 billion in short positions stacked below $100k, a massive short squeeze is primed for takeoff. And this time, BlackRock’s IBIT spot ETF could be the spark that sends BTC soaring into six-figure territory. BlackRock is absolutely dominating the scene with 52% of the spot Bitcoin ETF market, holding a hefty 604,049 BTC in its treasury. Meanwhile, rivals Fidelity and Grayscale are trailing with just 17%. Together, spot ETFs account for 5.82% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, with a combined 1.154 million BTC. Given BlackRock’s commanding position, it is a key player in Bitcoin’s next big market move. Source: X Since the 21st of April, IBIT alone has seen nearly $4 billion in inflows, right as Bitcoin smashed through the $85k resistance wall. Hence, tightening supply and turning up the pressure on short sellers. And institutional adoption? It’s not just talk. Brown University just allocated $4.9 million to IBIT, a 2% chunk of its $216 million endowment. That’s a signal that even Ivy League capital is leaning into the Bitcoin narrative. Meanwhile, net flows into rival spot ETFs remain flat, reinforcing the idea that BlackRock is driving the lion’s share of institutional momentum. With IBIT absorbing the bulk of inflows, BTC’s push toward the $100k mark could be fueled not by “hype” — but by cold, hard capital. According to AMBCrypto, fear is baked into the equation. A clean break above $100k would take Bitcoin back to early Q1 highs – prime territory for profit-taking. Short-term holders who’ve morphed into long-term holders may see this as their exit ramp, and bears won’t hesitate to pounce. Even now, as BTC grinds against the stubborn $96k resistance, market sentiment remains fragile. Over 63% of Binance’s BTC/USDT perpetual traders are skewed short, highlighting the hesitation. But that could flip fast. With institutional cash flooding into Bitcoin via IBIT, a liquidity sweep could turn that fear into FOMO in no time. At $97.5K, there’s already $12.46 million in leveraged positions active on the 12-hour lookback chart. A quick move could trigger liquidations and send BTC toward higher targets.

Title: Leinster may be semi-final specialists, but getting any further is often a coin toss

Is there a sudden outbreak of Leinster “big-game fatigue” out there? Let’s pause for a moment and put this weekend’s Champions Cup semi-finals into context. It actually is an achievement to be one of the last quartet in any competition. Leinster and Toulouse are specialists at reaching this stage in the Champions Cup. Everyone else should be so lucky. To start with the bleedin’ obvious, only four teams out of the 24 which started out this season have managed the feat. As the URC, Top 14 and Premiership pauses, the other 20 would happily swap places with those hogging the stage this weekend. Of course, reaching a final belongs to an even more exclusive club. Take Leinster. In the 30 years of what is now the Champions Cup, their encounter with Northampton on Saturday will be their 16th semi-final. If you stop and think about it, that truly is exceptional. Unsurprisingly, the only club to have reached more semi-finals are Toulouse. Against Bordeaux Bègles on Sunday, they will be playing their 17th semi-final. By contrast, Northampton are playing in their fifth and Bordeaux Bègles just their second. What might be a little more surprising is that even for the two highest achievers in the history of the tournament, there are no guarantees for Leinster and Toulouse when it comes to this stage of the tournament. Of Leinster’s 15 semi-finals to date, they have won eight and lost seven. For their part, Toulouse have also endured their fair share of disappointment at this stage, winning eight and losing eight of their previous 16. So, if there is a small element of big-game fatigue among Leinster fans, perhaps understandably, like all of us they have short memories. Admittedly it’s 30 years ago since Leinster reached their first semi-final way back in the inaugural European Cup in 1995-96 when they, as well as Munster and Ulster, were among a dozen teams drawn from France, Wales, Italy and Romania. Furthermore, all Leinster had to do was beat Milan away and Pontypridd at home to reach the last four. Almost despite themselves. Niall Woods was Leinster’s left winger in the province’s competition debut in Milan on November 1st, 1995, when the attendance was recorded as 1,200. “The game kicked off at 2.30 on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was a mudbath. Diego Dominguez was playing,” recalls Woods of the normally prolific Argentinian-born Italian outhalf. “He actually kicked two out of eight. It was filthy, as in the fighting, the gouging, the works. Obviously, I didn’t see any of that, nor was I anywhere near it.” [ Rugby analysis: Leinster attack looking more and more comfortable in chaosOpens in new window ] [ Matt Williams: Leinster can get past Northampton if they have planned for a new and improved opponentOpens in new window ] Despite Dominguez losing his radar, Leinster were losing the game late on. “I got the ball on the 10-yard line, at outhalf from a ruck in the middle of the field. I stepped a fella and was just gone. These were the days when if you broke the first line, then you just had to round the fullback and we won by three points,” says Woods of Leinster’s 24-21 victory. I remember getting a cheque, I think for £175 to play because you were technically allowed to be paid at that stage “The reason I remember is that ‘Munch’ (aka Shane Byrne) was asked in an interview for the best try he ever saw and he said that one. I read it and laughed and said ‘fair play Munch’. We were in [Blackrock] school together, so maybe that’s why.” Five weeks later, on a Wednesday night under lights, in what was also the first season of professionalism, Leinster beat Pontypridd 23-22 in Lansdowne Road to top their “group” and earn a home semi-final. “I remember getting a cheque, I think for £175 to play because you were technically allowed to be paid at that stage,” says Woods. Leinster’s first of 16 semi-finals was against Cardiff in Lansdowne Road on December 30th, 1995. “Conor [O’Shea] was with London Irish and Conor came home on standby in case I failed the fitness test. I failed the fitness test, I’d say at 11 o’clock. It was a horrendous day, blowing a gale and freezing, so I was quite happy. It wasn’t a day for me,” recalls Woods with a self-mocking chuckle. The attendance was 7,350. “Which was big in those days,” he stresses. “You’d get 2-4,000 max in those days in Donnybrook. It was decent, put it that way, although we played Australia in 1992 and there was probably 20,000 people there; they had won the World Cup in 1991 and they were fully loaded.” A European Cup semi-final was unchartered and underappreciated territory. He added: “It was totally unknown. It was something a bit different, playing someone from a different country in a game that meant something as opposed to a friendly. We played against New South Wales that season and I think we played eight games. Up to that point we played four games a year. “Cardiff were the most stacked team of the Welsh at that stage. They were the equivalent of Leinster now. As a spectacle, the game wasn’t great. The wind was horrific. Mary Robinson was President and they didn’t bring her out on to the pitch because it was so windy.” Leinster were beaten 23-14 and nobody was really complaining. “I don’t remember being overly bothered that we lost. We did all right because we got to the semis, even if we only won two matches to get there. It was enjoyable and it was a bit different.” Toulouse beat Cardiff at Cardiff Arms Park in the final a week later, with 21,800 in attendance, to give the European Cup lift-off. Whether it was over-confidence or not I don’t know It was seven years later when Leinster reached the semi-finals, meeting Perpignan at Lansdowne Road in April 2003. As evidenced by the 37,800 attendance, expectations were altogether higher. Woods had retired in 2001 after a playing career with Trinity, Blackrock, Leinster, Ireland, London Irish and Harlequins. He then worked for the English Players’ Union before coming home in January 2003 to set up the Irish Rugby Players’ Union (IRUPA). But in Leinster’s biggest game of the 2002-03 season, their season ended with an anticlimactic 21-14 defeat. “They didn’t perform on the day at all,” says Woods. “Whether it was over-confidence or not I don’t know. They never got going. It was hugely disappointing.” The pivotal matches in Leinster’s history were the Heineken Cup semi-finals against Munster in 2006 at Lansdowne Road and 2009 in Croke Park. Technically, the first was a “home” semi-final, though it was awash in red and felt like an away match. The second was an “away” tie that was more akin to a neutral-venue fixture given the even split between blue and red in a record-setting attendance of 82,208. “In 2006, ‘Rog’ dummies and scores under the sticks and in ’09 Drico intercepts Rog’s pass to score. They were the two defining moments,” says Woods with reference to Ronan O’Gara and Brian O’Driscoll. “The difference in colour was stark. In ’06 it was so red, when the Leinster supporters weren’t as strong as they are now, whereas in ’09 it was even.” Leinster had reached a point of no return. The 25-6 win led to a breakthrough triumph three weeks later against Leicester in Murrayfield. “It had started with the quarter-final in ‘Quins, the bloodgate game and that [6-5] win gave them belief. Even the final in Edinburgh was a poor enough game against Leicester, but it would always be scrappy against them. But they managed to do it. “In the semi, Leinster were notably better on the day. The [2009] Grand Slam probably helped. There was better quality throughout the Leinster team than there had been three years earlier, especially with Isa [Nacewa] and Rocky [Elsom] there.” Leinster have reached another 10 semi-finals since that day, winning seven of them, and the key has been earning home semi-finals through their performances in the pool stages. Leinster have won all six ensuing semi-finals at home, whereas they have won only one of four away from home. Leinster lost away to Toulouse as reigning champions in the 2010 semi-finals, when Johnny Sexton was injured, but have beaten Toulouse in four of the subsequent six semi-finals at home. There was defeat to Toulon in 2015 at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille, when Jimmy Gopperth’s drop-goal attempt to win the game was narrowly wide before Leinster were beaten in extra-time. They lost a last-four tie against Clermont in Lyon in 2017 and lost behind closed doors in La Rochelle four years ago. Viewed in that context, Leinster’s 19-15 win over a brilliant Clermont side [Julien Bonnaire, Morgan Parra, Wesley Fofana, Aurélien Rougerie and co] in Bordeaux in 2012 has arguably been their finest semi-final victory of all so far. “That was the inside pass to Rob Kearney and Cian Healy’s finish,” says Woods – who stepped down as the IRUPA CEO in January 2011 to set up what is now the Navy Blue sports agency – of the famous Joe Schmidt strike play. There was also the end-game stand on their own line, Gordon D’Arcy’s tackle on Fofana to dislodge the ball before he grounded it and Seán O’Brien hanging on for dear life in the jackal to earn the final turnover penalty. “I’d say that was their best ever semi-final win, considering who it was against and it was away from home,” says Woods, and to put that victory in context it was only the second semi-final win in France by an Irish or UK side – Munster having achieved the first in 2000 against Toulouse, also in Bordeaux. Reaching semi-finals should never be taken for granted, albeit as Woods says: “Leinster do have the majority of the Irish team and their budget is massive, above the French clubs as well as the English clubs now. But if Leinster are in any way off, the Saints have enough firepower to do damage.” Indeed, as history shows us, nor do semi-finals, even at home, come with any guarantees. “Go back to ’03, against Perpignan. They should have beaten Perpignan. They should never have lost that.” 1995-96: Leinster 14 Cardiff 23 (Lansdowne Road) 2002-03: Leinster 14 Perpignan 21 (Lansdowne Road) 2005-06: Leinster 6 Munster 30 (Lansdowne Road) 2008-09: Munster 6 Leinster 25 (Croke Park) 2009-10: Toulouse 26 Leinster 16 (Le Stadium, Toulouse) 2010-11: Leinster 32 Toulouse 23 (Aviva Stadium) 2011-12: Clermont 15 Leinster 19 (Stade Chaban-Delmas, Bordeaux) 2014-15: Toulon 25 Leinster 20 aet (Stade Velodrome, Marseille) 2016-17: Clermont 27 Leinster 22 (Matmut de Gerland, Lyon) 2017-18: Leinster 38 Scarlets 16 (Aviva Stadium) 2018-19: Leinster 30 Toulouse 12 (Aviva Stadium) 2020-21: La Rochelle 32 Leinster 23 (Stade Deflandre, La Rochelle) 2021-22: Leinster 40 Toulouse 17 (Aviva Stadium) 2022-23: Leinster 41 Toulouse 22 (Aviva Stadium) 2023-24: Leinster 20 Northampton 17 (Croke Park) © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto-stocks correlation returns as Bitcoin’s rally sparks surge in equities
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-stocks-correlation-returns-as-bitcoins-rally-sparks-surge-in-equities/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T23:00:57Z

Bitcoin’s hike has revived its correlation with equities, driven by institutional interest. Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has appreciated significantly over the last few days, with the same driving renewed interest in the digital asset and equities connected to it. With institutional players increasingly looking towards Bitcoin as an asset class, the relationship between BTC and traditional equities has strengthened too. This alignment can be best evidenced by the performances of companies holding large Bitcoin reserves, as well as those in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Most of their stock prices have been buoyed by Bitcoin’s own momentum. Bitcoin’s remarkable hike in value has had a tangible impact on the stock prices of crypto-related businesses. At press time, BTC was trading at $96,684, following a 1.41% hike in the last 24 hours. Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 550,000 Bitcoins, saw its shares rise dramatically, with a 400% increase this year alone. Similarly, Cantor Equity Partners’ stock surged by 462% after merging with a crypto firm. To put it simply, BTC’s price action has had an effect on not just the cryptocurrency market, but also on the stock prices of companies in related sectors. Here, it’s worth pointing out that the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S equities, particularly the Nasdaq 100, climbed to unprecedented levels recently. In fact, BTC’s 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 hit +0.70 on the charts. This alignment seemed to highlight the increasing parallel movement of BTC with traditional equities, particularly tech stocks. As major tech companies continue to report strong earnings, Bitcoin has tracked these trends closely, reflecting a shared investor sentiment towards risk-on assets. Source: TradingView Institutional adoption of Bitcoin is also a major factor in strengthening its correlation with equities. Bitcoin ETFs have become increasingly popular, with large financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity providing institutional investors with exposure to the cryptocurrency. The growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream investment vehicle is shifting investor sentiment, with BTC increasingly seen as a risk-on asset, much like equities. As a result, Bitcoin’s price movements are beginning to mirror those of the broader stock market. Particularly in sectors such as technology. Now, despite Bitcoin’s strong performance, its volatility remains a concern for many investors. While its recent surge has been impressive, experts believe that Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset is still uncertain. Although BTC has shown resilience, its price swings can be drastic. And, many investors remain cautious about its potential to sustain long-term growth without further market stabilization. However, the increasing institutional interest in BTC and the broader integration of digital assets into the financial system suggest that the future of BTC may be more secure than ever before. Bitcoin’s price surge has affected the cryptocurrency market. However, it has also led to a renewed correlation with equities, particularly in the tech sector. Institutional adoption and the growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream asset have helped drive this shift. While volatility remains a concern, the increasing integration of BTC into traditional markets points to a promising future for both Bitcoin and crypto-related equities.

Title: Major Art Patrons Donated to Trump Inauguration: Report

By Karen K. Ho Senior Writer, ARTnews Major art collectors Warren Stephens, Ken Griffin, and Paul Singer, as well as Charles and Helen Schwab were among the top individual donors to President Donald Trump’s inauguration fundraising committee. The top individual donor to President Trump’s 2025 inauguration was Stephens, who gave $4 million and is a major donor to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Art, according to data released by the Federal Election Commission and new analysis from Open Secrets, a nonprofit research and government transparency group based in Washington, DC. Related Articles Billionaire Art Collector Ken Griffin Says US Is 'Eroding' Its Brand Top 200 Collectors Bernard Arnault, Alice Walton and Jeff Bezos Lose Billions Again After Major Stock Sell-Offs In 2023 the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts announced that Warren Stephens and his wife, Harriet, endowed eight galleries. The couple also chair the museum’s building committee and foundation board, as well as cochairing its successful capital campaign, which raised more than $160 million. Until last year, Stephens was the CEO of his namesake financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock. Trump nominated him to be ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland in December. Stephens was confirmed to the position by the US Senate on April 29. Other seven-figure donations from individuals to President Trump’s 2025 inauguration included $1.1 million from Top 200 collectors Charles and Helen Schwab, $1 million from Top 200 collector and Citadel founder Ken Griffin, as well as $1 million from art collector and Elliott Management founder Paul Singer. Federal filings showed Trump raised more than $239 million for his second inauguration, far exceeding the $107 million raised in 2017. By comparison, Joe Biden raised $61 million for his inauguration in 2021, and Barack Obama raised $44 million and $53 million for his inaugurations in 2013 and 2009, respectively. Many large US companies also made donations to Trump’s 2025 inauguration, including donations of $1 million from Amazon, which was founded by Top 200 collector Jeff Bezos; $1 million from Blackrock Financial Management Inc, whose cofounder and CEO is Top 200 collector Larry Fink; and $1 million from Tyson Shared Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods. The current chairman of Tyson Foods, John H. Tyson, is also chairman of the board at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The institution awards the annual Don Tyson Prize for American Art, worth $200,000, and named for the former chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods. In addition to donations for President Trump’s inauguration fundraising committee, data from the FEC and Open Secrets show that Griffin donated $100 million to help elect conservatives, the fifth-largest amount for individual contributions to federal election spending for 2024. Griffin’s largest disclosed donations were to the Senate Leadership Fund, on four separate occasions, totaling $30 million. He also made donations totaling $15 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, $15 million to the Keystone Renewal PAC and $10 million to Maryland’s Future, a single-candidate super political action committee in support of Republican Larry Hogan for the US Senate. By comparison, Singer donated $64.15 million (including a total of $27 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, and $14.5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund), Stephens donated $23.4 million (including a total of $5.5 million to Senate Leadership Fund, $2.91 million to SFA Fund, and $2.75 million to Congressional Leadership Fund), while the Schwabs donated $9.3 million (including $6 million for the Senate Leadership Fund and $3 million for the Congressional Leadership Fund). Last month, Griffin told Semafor senior editor Gina Chon the US was “eroding” its brand as a result of many of the economic policy changes under Trump. Announcements of tariffs have resulted in volatility in the stock markets, a sell-off in US government bonds, and left art professionals scrambling. Volatility in global stock markets also resulted in the net worth of many Top 200 collectors declining by billions of dollars, including a drop of more than $6.6 billion for Bezos between April 3 and April 7.

Title: Crypto market today: Bitcoin hits $97K as Dogecoin, Sonic, Litecoin & AERO lead altcoin rally
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-market-today-bitcoin-hits-97k-as-dogecoin-sonic-litecoin-aero-lead-altcoin-rally/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T21:00:32Z

Bitcoin rallies past $97K, sparking altcoin gains as net outflows and ETF inflows boost sentiment. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past $97,000, reclaiming a critical level and reinforcing bullish momentum across the market. This move follows weeks of consolidation, and now positions Bitcoin just steps away from testing the psychological $100K resistance. Institutional appetite remains strong, with firms like BlackRock’s IBIT fund surpassing $43 billion in assets under management due to massive inflows over the past two weeks These developments, combined with technical confirmation of a pennant breakout, suggest confidence is returning fast, and price discovery may soon resume above historical highs. Altcoins have mirrored Bitcoin’s momentum, with capital rotating into risk-on tokens as sentiment improves. Market optimism has been fueled by a rebound in social engagement, a rise in Open Interest across derivatives, and declining exchange reserves. Notably, altcoin market dominance has climbed, signaling broader participation. Investors appear to be positioning ahead of potential macro catalysts, including expected ETF-related announcements and further easing in global monetary conditions. As a result, the market outlook has grown increasingly optimistic, with both majors and microcaps seeing renewed demand and stronger technical setups. Several altcoins are outperforming amid the rally, each driven by unique catalysts. Dogecoin [DOGE] is enjoying revived meme coin enthusiasm, backed by surging social dominance and speculative flows. Sonic [S] has gained traction following major integrations and a notable rise in its total value locked, which underscores increasing utility. Litecoin [LTC], long seen as a conservative alternative to Bitcoin, is riding a wave of ETF optimism and broader market interest. Meanwhile, Aerodrome [AERO] is gaining attention as activity on the Base chain expands. These tokens reflect growing appetite for diverse risk profiles during bullish cycles. Institutional appetite continues to be a major catalyst for the current rally, with consistent ETF inflows and strategic positioning by large funds like BlackRock. However, what further strengthens the bullish outlook is the negative exchange netflow data. A net outflow of approximately 259.49 million coins, representing a -1.6% change, indicates that more assets are leaving exchanges than entering. This suggests investors are moving their holdings to cold storage or DeFi protocols, reducing sell-side pressure. When combined with clearer regulatory momentum, this trend highlights a strong conviction in long-term crypto exposure. Source: CryptoQuant The rally appears structurally sound, driven by both macro tailwinds and on-chain strength. With Bitcoin eyeing six figures and altcoins showing sector-wide participation, the market is clearly regaining confidence. If institutional flows and regulatory momentum persist, the current bullish trend could evolve into a sustained move higher across the board.

Title: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know

Highlights Institutional moves this week from state and federal governments, and even Ivy League institutions are providing a growing signal that bitcoin and other digital assets are becoming entrenched in traditional financial operations. Major financial firms like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab and BlackRock are expanding crypto services, from ETFs to blockchain-powered fund classes. The institutionalization of digital assets, especially bitcoin ETFs and stablecoins, is reshaping enterprise treasury strategies — enabling diversification, real-time settlements and cross-border liquidity amid growing regulatory clarity. The first publicly traded bitcoin financial services company rang the Nasdaq opening bell on Friday (May 2). The invitation given to Fold Holdings Inc. is just one signal among many, that, in a span of just a few months, cryptocurrency has entered a new phase of mainstream financial adoption. And it’s just scratching the surface of a week that also saw the Arizona State Legislature move to the governor’s desk a pair of bills that could pave the way to create the country’s first state-level bitcoin reserve, while Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doubling down on its own corporate bitcoin stockpile by raising $84 billion to buy more of the nominal crypto asset. “With over 70 public companies worldwide now adopting a Bitcoin treasury standard, we are proud to be at the forefront in pioneering this space,” Strategy President and Chief Executive Officer said Phong Le said in a Thursday (May 1) earnings press release. Even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. Against this backdrop, observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles. As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration. Read also: The Digital Asset Primer: Corporate Treasury Moves From HODL to Yield It’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms exploring crypto, but 2025 has marked a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its vast E*Trade client base as soon as 2026, potentially introducing millions of retail investors to digital assets through a familiar platform. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is gearing up to launch spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum within the year, aiming to meet increasing demand from traditional investors seeking exposure. These moves are not isolated. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency. Perhaps the most eye-catching development in 2025 has been the Trump family’s foray into stablecoins. The USD1 token, unveiled at a Dubai conference and reportedly used in a $2 billion Binance investment by Abu Dhabi’s MGX, has raised both eyebrows and strategic questions. The token is part of a broader push by Trump allies to position themselves as power brokers in the crypto world. “There’s certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner told PYMNTS in an interview posted April 23. “This is not a confrontational posture.” Together, these developments signify a major realignment of the financial world. Crypto, once believed to be a fringe and risk-heavy domain, is now becoming a potential pillar of corporate strategy. But what does it all mean for corporate treasurers managing enterprise funds? See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects The crypto landscape in 2025 introduces both opportunities and new complexities for corporate treasury teams. With bitcoin ETFs and institutional-grade platforms going live, treasurers have access to new, regulated asset classes. These can be useful for diversification, but they also require clear policy frameworks and risk management strategies. Moves like BlackRock’s tokenization of funds hint at a future where treasury instruments operate on blockchain rails. This could enable real-time settlement, improved auditability and operational efficiencies. As regulatory clarity emerges around stablecoins in particular, they are becoming potentially viable tools for cross-border payments and intra-company fund flows as treasurers investigate their use as liquid, programmable cash equivalents. As PYMNTS covered, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high in April amid strong performance across cryptocurrency sectors. Regulatory maturation, the real-world quest for stablecoin utility, and the institutionalization of digital assets mark a turning point in which the Wild West days of crypto are being replaced by a convergence with mainstream finance, PYMNTS reported April 23.

Title: ‘XRP Is Not Dead’ — Crypto Influencer Explains Why Ripple’s XRP Could Still Be Crypto’s Biggest Sleeping Giant

Popular crypto influencer John Squire has commented on the popular claim within the crypto community from critics labeling XRP as a “dead coin”. In Squire’s view, XRP is “loading,” potentially setting up for a monumental rally. In a May 1 lengthy post on X, John Squire noted that Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP is the only top 10 cryptocurrency to have been mired in a multi-year-long legal battle with the U.S. government and emerged victorious. Now that the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded, Squire believes XRP could witness a floodgate of institutional adoption, which could subsequently propel its price north. According to the pundit, big money is currently warming up as the CME Group prepares to roll out cash-settled XRP futures this month. It’s worth mentioning that a similar product from America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, launched in April, signaling institutional-grade interest in XRP. Squire backed this sentiment by citing rumors of a potential XRP trust from asset management giant BlackRock — arguably the most highly awaited XRP product. He claims this is not retail-driven hype but early indications of Wall Street quietly positioning itself. Squire further suggested that while many crypto projects pursue hype cycles, XRP is focused on the global international payments sector, which currently hovers at $150 trillion annually. Ripple has previously speculated that this market could rocket to $300 trillion by 2030. Ripple currently has active payment rails in Japan, Singapore, and the UAE. Squire stressed that this level of adoption is a sign that real-world use cases for XRP are already in motion. He also predicted that spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now closer than ever after the SEC greenlighted similar products based on Bitcoin and Ether in 2024. Squire believes XRP’s underwhelming price performance is intentional. The asset has held steadily above the $2 mark despite many skeptics often predicting its doom. He further highlighted bullish on-chain metrics such as rising volume and a cooling RSI. Squire argues that smart money does not chase pumps, instead, it buys when the market is boring. In summaryXRP is:✔️ Battle-tested✔️ Institutionally aligned✔️ Legally resilient✔️ Technologically deployedThis isn’t hopium. This is asymmetric risk with real-world traction. That being said, Squire is convinced that XRP could be silently loading in the background, awaiting its moment to go parabolic. And when the sleeping giant of crypto finally awakens, as the influencer astutely puts it, “the whole game changes.”

Title: Natasha Oakley And Devin Brugman Join Hemp Period Brand Rif Care As Investors

ByYola Robert ByYola Robert, Senior Contributor. Rebecca Caputo, Natasha Oakley, Val Emanuel and Devin Brugman. Oakley and Brugman have joined Caputo ... More and Emanuel as investors to Rif Care. In 2020, Val Emanuel went through a major life change after uncovering hormone imbalances and high heavy metal levels in her body. Having struggled with hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, migraines, and painful, heavy periods for years, she decided to rid herself of toxic products and switch to organic personal care products. During this process, Emanuel realized that there were few high-quality, biodegradable, and innovative period care options for women. As a lover of hemp, she decided to pursue making disposable period products from hemp fiber, even though factories told her repeatedly it was impossible. Emanuel launched a crowdfunding campaign a year later, and her best friend and scientist, Rebecca Caputo, started helping. Caputo had also experienced hormone imbalance and infertility. Emanuel brought on Caputo in 2022 and the pair launched the first hemp fiber menstrual pads on the market known as Rif Care. Rif Care founders, Val Emanuel and Rebecca Caputo, pride themselves on educating women on period ... More health and non-toxic living. On track for over $1 million in sales in 2025 and in over 200 retail stores, Caputo and Emanuel have added new investors and founders of Monday Swimwear, Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman, to their cap table. “Our first investor, a C-suite executive at BlackRock, had experience with contracts, M&A and also looked over every single deck and deal. I don’t know if we could have done it without him and he also was our BIGGEST cheerleader. Now, we are looking to bring on more influential women who know how to sell to and talk to other women marketing-wise. Natasha and Devin are amazing at direct-to-consumer selling, so we are using their advice and expertise as a guiding force for growing online. Before the investment, we did 500k in sales with only 10k spent on ads. Most of it has been organic through social media, word of mouth and smaller retail accounts so now we have money to fuel that growth,” they explained. Ashley Graham, Nancy Twine, La Familia Foundation, Crom Carmichael, Techstar and Jumpstart Foundry are also investors in the brand. In addition to direct-to-consumer growth, Rif Care will be using new investments to hire a sales team as they expand into more retailers nationwide. Natashy Oakley and Devin Brugman are Rif Care's newest investors. Brugman and Oakley felt like they shared a common mission with Rif —to celebrate, uplift, and improve the lives of women. Oakley initially reached out via an Instagram message to Emanuel asking to see if Rif was open to new investors. “That alignment really stood out. We’re both female-founded with all-female teams, which creates a strong sense of shared values and vision. I’ve been consistently impressed by Val and Rebecca’s passion and the thoughtfulness behind Rif. Their authenticity and commitment made it a natural decision to get involved,” they shared. “As a first step, we’re working closely with them to build out a diverse, thorough, and effective marketing plan tailored to their key markets. We’re also making some early suggestions on product development to support growth and differentiation.” Women on average are exposed to 168 harmful chemicals every day that can affect hormones and reproduction. Rif Care is one of the only period care brands utilizing hemp for period care, “Hemp is a super fiber that was one of the most utilized materials for thousands of years and then when it became illegal, its use became taboo and its availability became more limited. Hemp produces a high-performing fiber that’s super absorbent and comfortable. It doesn't need any pesticides to grow. It is naturally antibacterial, antimicrobial and grows with less water than cotton. Hemp is also an amazing fiber as a non-woven, which is its newest use that we brought to market. We also think there was an opportunity to make hemp less crunchy and more modern, and approachable to women,” shared Caputo and Emanuel. Rif carries organic hemp tampons, pads and leak-proof period underwear. Educating women is another big pillar in Rif’s mission from cycle education to understanding the ingredients in personal care products. “As women, we have to shop for food and beauty products with our health in mind and really know what every ingredient means. There's growing awareness of the toxins in personal care products. From heavy metals found in tampons to PFA forever chemicals in our underwear, women are learning how companies have taken shortcuts that make us sick and cause our hormones to get out of whack. Some women are choosing to change their buying habits once they learn this.Did you know that conventional tampons can shed up to 160 billion nano plastics? And that's not over a lifetime — that's every month! It would be hard for me to learn that and still use polyurethane and viscose tampons!” exclaimed Emanuel. To make all this information more digestible the co-wrote an e-book about periods called the Menarche Manual alongside Gynecologist, Dr. Carrillo, and Rif’s in-house endometriosis expert, Andoeni Ruezga. Currently Rif Care sells three hero products: leak proof period underwear, pads with wings and tampons. When asked about new product developments, nursing pads and expansion of the period underwear are in the pipeline for this year. You can find Rif Care at Erewhon, Gelsons, Lassens, Mom’s and online.

Title: Large $422 million inflow into Bitcoin ETFs as BlackRock dominates with $351 million

Time Published: 2025-05-02T15:50:02Z

With $351 million inflow, BlackRock outpaces rivals in expanding Bitcoin ETF assets. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $422 million in inflows on May 1, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which added $351 million. The move followed Thursday’s outflow, which broke an eight-day win streak and pushed cumulative net flows for US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs back to $39.5 billion since their launch (including Grayscale outflows), according to Farside Investors’ data. Total Bitcoin ETF AUM across both spot funds has reached $112 billion as the Bitcoin price continues to rise well above ETF launch prices. BlackRock’s IBIT alone has had total inflows of an AUM of $58 billion, or 597k BTC. The gap in net cumulative flows and AUM is mainly due to the price appreciation of Bitcoin since those inflows arrived (plus a few small items such as accrued cash, fees, and rounding). Net inflows are historical costs; AUM is marked‑to‑market. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB saw smaller gains of $29.5 million and $38.4 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s GBTC posted $16 million in net inflows after prolonged outflows. The renewed inflows arrived as Bitcoin surpassed $97,000 on May 2, drawing attention to the feedback loop between spot prices and ETF demand. The gap between the largest issuers remains wide. While BlackRock and Fidelity benefit from deep distribution networks, smaller players such as Valkyrie and VanEck recorded little or no daily flow. Competitive pressures may grow as Grayscale considers pricing adjustments to stem outflows and maintain relevance in a rapidly maturing ETF landscape.

Title: Goldman Sachs scrubs mentions of ‘Black’ from racial diversity web page amid DEI rollback
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/05/02/business/goldman-sachs-scrubs-word-black-from-diversity-initiative-web-page/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T14:35:57Z
Full Content:
Goldman Sachs has scrubbed mentions of “Black” and other references to race from its official website touting a diversity initiative amid an industrywide rollback of so-called DEI programs and increasing scrutiny from the Trump administration, according to a report. In 2021, the Wall Street giant launched the “One Million Black Women” program in which it pledged $10 billion in investments and $100 million in philanthropy specifically aimed at supporting black women. Goldman in recent weeks has revised promotional language for its “One Million Black Women” initiative, removing explicit references to race and reframing the program in more generic economic terms, the Wall Street Journal reported. A comparison of old and new text shows that phrases like “for one million Black women by 2030” and “Black women’s lives” were deleted, while broader terms such as “growth and opportunity” were added. The bank also replaced repeated mentions of “One Million Black Women” with “Goldman Sachs” in several places, shifting the emphasis from a demographic focus to the institution itself. Another diversity-based Goldman initiative called “Black in Business,” which was originally designed explicitly for black businesswomen, has also had racial references removed. The program’s description now simply states it helps entrepreneurs “stay in the black,” referring generally to maintaining profitability. Additionally, updated figures show an increase in financial commitments, with investment capital rising from “nearly $3 billion” to “$3.6 billion,” and philanthropic support increasing from “$39.4 million” to “$41 million.” The changes appear aimed at preserving the program’s economic goals while minimizing legal risks associated with race-specific language. Goldman instituted changes to the program two years ago by opening it up to all solo entrepreneurs — though the bank quietly removed explicit references to race from the program’s homepage in recent weeks. The name of the program itself remains unchanged. Earlier this year, The Post reported that Goldman planned to scale back its DEI, or diversity, equity and inclusion policies in response to pressure from the Trump administration and the threat of lawsuits, joining other Wall Street firms like BlackRock and Bank of America in removing DEI language from official filings. The recent revisions reflect wider corporate anxieties about potential legal repercussions surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, especially since a Supreme Court ruling in 2023 declared race-based affirmative action in college admissions unconstitutional. In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated the Equal Protection Clause, effectively ending affirmative action in college admissions. This landmark decision prompted Goldman and other corporations to reconsider the structure of their diversity programs to avoid legal challenges and criticism from the Trump administration. Investments related to the program are now primarily managed through Goldman’s Urban Investment Group, helping the bank comply with federal mandates aimed at supporting low-income areas. Initially, Goldman had planned for other internal teams to actively invest in projects specifically benefiting black women. “One Million Black Women is one component of our longstanding commitment and broader strategy focused on advancing small businesses, job creation, and economic growth in rural and urban communities across America,” Asahi Pompey, Goldman’s global head of corporate engagement, told The Post. “We regularly evaluate our programs to ensure they are impactful, align with the firm’s strategy, and are compliant with the law.” Several major Wall Street firms have scaled back or modified their DEI initiatives in recent years. In February, Goldman ended its requirement for companies going public to have diverse board representation, citing legal developments. BlackRock recently did away with workforce representation goals and no longer mandates diverse candidate slates for interviews, while also merging its DEI team. Bank of America has removed “diversity and inclusion” from its latest annual report, opting for terms like “opportunity and inclusion.” Similarly, JPMorgan Chase has reduced its mentions of DEI, and CEO Jamie Dimon suggested some efforts might have been “excessive.” Citigroup’s CEO announced the end of mandatory diverse applicant pools for new hires and State Street has dropped its specific board diversity targets in its proxy voting guidelines.

As regulatory barriers lift, Goldman Sachs embraces blockchain for enhanced trade flexibility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Goldman Sachs aims to bring tokenized Treasuries and money market fund shares into round-the-clock trading, according to digital assets head Mathew McDermott at TOKEN2049 in Dubai. The move reflects broader ambitions to integrate traditional collateral into blockchain infrastructure as clients increase demand for on-chain exposure. The firm already operates a crypto derivatives desk and is preparing to launch three tokenization projects in 2025. These include its first U.S. fund tokenization and a euro-denominated digital bond. Tokenized money market funds have surpassed $1 billion in assets under management. McKinsey says the sector could expand to $2 trillion by 2030. Offerings from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and various Web3 firms provide early liquidity, creating opportunities for tokenized collateral to support more flexible and continuous settlement cycles. Tokenized Treasuries have surpassed $5 billion with BlackRock’s BUIDL leading the way. Policy developments have removed major regulatory hurdles. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Interpretive Letter 1183, issued in March, allows national banks to conduct crypto custody, stablecoin operations, and distributed ledger settlements without prior approval. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC collectively withdrew previous 2023 guidance discouraging crypto activity. The reversals align U.S. rules with global jurisdictions and are part of broader deregulatory efforts under the Trump administration. Goldman is also considering spinning off its Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP) into a separate entity. This initiative would allow the platform to serve multiple institutions, aiming for shared infrastructure to improve efficiency and accelerate liquidity, which is essential for the secondary trading of tokenized Treasuries and other assets. However, challenges persist. Goldman continues to favor permissioned blockchains to meet compliance requirements. Additionally, bank custodians still face regulatory capital requirements tied to on-chain holdings under SEC guidance. Liquidity in tokenized bonds remains limited, suggesting secondary markets will require time to mature. The bank’s roadmap positions it to introduce tokenized government debt products that can be traded outside standard market hours. The approach reflects an effort to meet evolving institutional demand and align blockchain integration with traditional market mechanics.

Title: Why BTC May Be The Only Institutional Asset
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexanderblume/2025/05/02/why-btc-may-be-the-only-institutional-asset/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T13:43:25Z
Full Content:
ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. ETH Price Has Fallen Sharply Against BTC Over the Past Year Over the past six months, BTC and ETH have started acting like two distinct assets. BTC has remained robust and consistent. Meanwhile, ETH has started to behave more like a memecoin and has lost momentum on many fronts. ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have made it difficult for institutions to continue to engage. The risk-reward is hard to justify and the momentum of statistics like new developers and users is moving in the wrong direction as compared to competitors. The data suggests ETH has fundamentally changed. It has de-correlated from BTC and added much greater tail risk. It trades now like a memecoin rather than a predictable asset. Even during the turbulence of Q1 2025, bitcoin remained within its fundamental behavior, whereas ETH saw several multi-standard deviation moves. This comes from a risk-off environment and a general capitulation of long-term ETH holders on the asset. For both algorithmic trading and ETH-backed lending, this creates a headache as the asset no longer behaves predictably, even by the high volatility expectations of digital asset markets. ETH 30 day v 30 day forward return shows little mean reversion or positive momentum This chart shows 30-day vs. 30-day forward returns. It is a method for observing an asset's momentum. Dots in the lower left quadrant mean that the asset is moving in a negative direction. Assets that hover near the middle show mean reversion characteristics. Since the election in November of 2024, ETH has shown very little rebound and a lot of negative momentum. Meanwhile, bitcoin has largely reverted, meaning people are “buying the dip.” With ETH, they are not. Historically, these two assets have been highly correlated, but that is no longer the case. This makes sense as the assets are actually quite different and simply share the fact that they both operate on a blockchain. 30 day volatility of ETH has started to behave more like DOGE In this chart, we observe the amount of volatility over a 30-day period for BTC, ETH, and DOGE. High volatility can be profitable at times, but for institutional investors and traders, higher levels of volatility equate to lower position sizing. As the chart shows, ETH volatility has behaved more like DOGE than BTC since the start of the year. This makes institutional participation less attractive, suggesting declining trading volumes and market depth. BTC ETF AUM Has Far Outpaced Both Gross Performance and As % of Total Supply Lastly, we can see that ETF buying of BTC has far outpaced that of ETH by almost 24 times. Even with a higher market cap, BTC total supply consumed by ETFs is more than double that of the ETH supply. The real demand here may even be overstated for ETH, as much of this buying is likely offset by short futures positions by traders engaging in the basis trade for delta-neutral yield. For digital assets to survive, they must find a meaningful bid from mainstream retail and institutional participants. The failure of ETH’s ETF creates a reflexive loop whereby institutions like BlackRock dedicate fewer resources to their promotion and sale. BTC has found the mainstream while ETH has floundered. Narratives do matter, though. Unlike BTC, ETH’s value prop is to be a Turing-complete decentralized computer. It aims to allow all types of decentralized applications to be built and operate on the platform. However, though ETH had a first-mover advantage and benefited from network effects of scale, many rising competitors have better fundamental technology and the ability to monetize. The most obvious example is Solana. Without getting too deep into the data, Solana and others offer faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and a better user experience than ETH. For some slow transactions, ETH works perfectly fine, but for others that require near-zero latency, like gaming or payments, ETH simply can’t compete. Further, the business model has essentially allowed ETH L2s to cannibalize almost all of the monetization of this infrastructure. How does something produce ongoing value if it can’t explain how it makes money? As a result, it has lost significant market share to Solana and others over the past few years, judged by the number of active developers, daily active users of products, and price appreciation. ETH has many competitors with better fundamental offerings for speed and cost Finally, and most subjectively, the vibes are just wrong. From my perspective, ETH became a victim of its early success, growing into a bureaucratic and ideological organization rather than one focused on building a tech product. The lack of strong leadership and clear focus has led to mission creep, with no single thing being done particularly well, and decisions being hindered by slow processes. While decentralization is a pleasant ideal, competitive start-up markets require efficient leadership. As digital assets become more deeply ingrained in the mainstream, most people are largely unconcerned about the speed and block size sacrifices that ETH makes for security. They do not care about the egalitarian governance values that paralyze making changes to the technology. They want a product that works. They want an investment that outperforms. Bitcoin stands alone in its use case. It has no competitor in digital assets. This has been reflected by statements from finance leaders like Blackrock’s Larry Fink, Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Strategy CEO, Michael Saylor. Bitcoin aims to be one thing, and it does it well. Institutions flock to economies and assets that are consistent and predictable. Bitcoin growth of hashrate, institutional buyers, distribution, and price all trend positively and consistently. The existing scale of the asset and the remaining upside of global adoption make BTC a far better risk-weighted investment than ETH. This can be seen in both measures of network growth and how the asset trades statistically. ETH and its competitors are essentially speculative tech startups fighting for market share. The issue for ETH and its leadership is that everyone but them seems to know that.

Title: Why Larry Fink’s devilishly complicated Panama Canal deal may finally come good

Larry Fink is going full throttle to complete its mega deal to purchase 43 ports including two on the Panama Canal – but bringing it all home will require some delicate maneuvering, sources told On The Money. The BlackRock boss needs to get 23 countries to sign off on a new partnership headed by his giant investment firm to take control of dozens of ports worldwide from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. The Panama government, however, is accusing Hutchison of breach of contract and wants hundreds of millions of dollars it claims it hasn’t been paid for leasing rights. Fink also needs approval from China, which if you haven’t noticed, is immersed in a nasty little trade war with the US. That means no deal might get approved involving any US company, whether it’s TikTok being sold to a consortium of US investors or Blackrock’s deal with Hutchison. So why is Fink forging ahead? First, Larry plays a long game and this isn’t his first big deal. There’s a 145-day grace period from the time the deal was announced back on March 4. That’s when Fink’s bankers plan on “papering” the transaction, meaning they get those two-dozen or so countries that need to approve the port deal to do so, and then he will turn his attention to China. Fink is no stranger to doing deals on the Mainland; he knows his way around the Chinese Communist Party’s bureaucracy, which is a requisite for doing business there. Recall, BlackRock was the first money management firm to set up a Chinese asset management subsidiary a few years back in an attempt to sell its funds to the country’s emerging upper class and wealthy elite. Still, this deal is different given the fraught nature of the US-China tariff war. President Trump paused tariffs on every country but China, then doubled down on the latter. Beijing responded by threatening US exports with the same. Despite some happy talk from the administration about early stage negotiations, the Chinese are now balking at finding a middle ground. But Fink is betting the trade war might not matter all that much because Hutchison is a Hong Kong-based company, not one domiciled on the Mainland. Yes, the CCP has been exerting more influence on Hong Kong despite its status as a “special administrative region” with a degree of independence. It has stopped short of a full takeover because the autonomy has allowed the city to flourish as a business center. The Hong Kong stock market, for instance, is one of the world’s largest.

Never miss a story. By negating the Hutchison deal, China would be setting a precedent, alerting every company that does business in Hong Kong it would face similar CCP scrutiny. “Does China really want to tell the world that Hong Kong is no longer Hong Kong,”‘ said one person with direct knowledge of the deal. “I don’t think so.” That’s why Fink is still betting that American flags (and the Blackrock logo) will ultimately find their way to the Panama Canal.

Title: DEI is winning with Costco, Apple and Levi’s shareholders | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) has been losing with corporate America, with one big exception: the people who actually own the companies. This year, investors at some of America’s biggest companies — Costco, Apple, Levi’s, John Deere, Goldman Sachs and others — have overwhelmingly voted against proposals targeting DEI programs. The proposals include requiring companies to scrap their DEI policies entirely or remove diversity goals from executive pay packages and audit the legal risks of pursuing DEI. Two conservative think tanks, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center, have brought most of the proposals. The near-unanimous shareholder votes show two things — large and small investors alike do not want companies’ boards of directors and management to bend to activist shareholders, and investors believe maintaining DEI programs is good for business. The rejections of anti-DEI proposals “reveal that the investor community doesn’t think that having a tough stance on DEI makes financial sense,” said Matteo Gatti, a professor of law at Rutgers University who studies corporate governance. “Investors are saying they don’t want ideological shareholders to drive business.” DEI in the workplace is generally a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices. The goals are to advance representation of different races, genders and classes, people with disabilities, veterans and other groups. But opponents like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO and close advisor to President Donald Trump, say DEI represents “reverse racism.” From Target to Meta, dozens of companies have modified or rolled back their diversity programs in recent months under pressure from the Trump administration, right-wing activists such Robby Starbuck and conservative legal groups. But shareholder votes are a rare area where DEI opponents are losing. It’s no surprise. Large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, are the top shareholders of most companies. They typically oppose outside shareholder resolutions, siding with company management in around 90% of the votes. “Just because DEI is falling out of the political winds doesn’t mean the votes have changed,” said Jon Solorzano, a partner at Vinson & Elkins who advises companies on environmental, social and governance issues. Winning a shareholder vote is not the sole purpose of conservative groups bringing the proposals. Anti-DEI resolutions are an inexpensive way for activist shareholders to draw media attention, gin up financial and political support for the groups bringing the resolutions and keep up pressure on companies over their DEI policies, Gatti said. “Part of it is to get people to pay attention,” he said. Win or lose, the proposals may add momentum for banning shareholder votes on climate, social and political issues in companies’ proxy statements. A proxy statement precedes a meeting where investors vote on nominees for board of directors, executive compensation packages and other business issues. The Business Roundtable, an influential business lobbying group, called for reforms to the proxy process last week, claiming activist investors have increasingly used it to “promote public policy agendas unrelated to company performance.” Conservative groups say anti-DEI shareholder proposals give them leverage to negotiate with companies and seek changes. For example, the National Legal and Policy Center withdrew an anti-DEI shareholder proposal at PepsiCo after PepsiCo said it would end its goals for minority representation in managerial roles. “We think that the work we’ve done with shareholder proposals elevates the conversation and puts companies on the defensive,” said Luke Perlot, the associate director of the National Legal and Policy Center’s Corporate Integrity Project. Shareholder proposals are “one of the most effective tools” of the group’s corporate activism work. Opponents of DEI are taking a page from DEI advocates. Shareholder proposals urging companies to improve DEI policies surged in 2020 and 2021, but have dwindled in recent years. Investors and companies have become fatigued with following through on their DEI commitments, and pressure has increased on companies to steer clear of social issues. Meanwhile, anti-DEI shareholder proposals have grown, part of a broader campaign on the right to crack down on DEI. Shareholder proposals opposing DEI accounted for only 7% of all DEI-related proposals in 2022. In 2024, that accelerated to 23%. As of April 1, approximately 40% of proposals around DEI oppose DEI efforts, according to a recent report by The Conference Board. But these anti-DEI proposals have received little investor support, averaging less than 2% of shareholder support. “Institutional investors and proxy advisors consistently oppose these resolutions, viewing them as misaligned with corporate governance best practices and investor priorities,” the Conference Board said in the report. “The proposals also originate from a small group of activists rather than mainstream investor coalitions, further limiting their appeal.” In Costco’s case, the proposal galvanized public support of Costco for sticking up for DEI. More than 98% of Costco shareholders voted down a proposal brought by the National Center for Public Policy Research that would have required the company to evaluate and issue a report on the financial risks of maintaining its diversity and inclusion goals. Costco’s management opposed the proposal. The company said its DEI efforts help it attract and retain a wide range of employees and improve merchandise and services in stores. “Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the ‘treasure hunt’ that our customers value,” Costco said in its proxy statement to investors. Most institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard still believe having a diverse workforce and customer base are good for business, said Atinuke Adediran, an associate professor of law at Fordham University who studies corporate governance and racial diversity. “The rhetoric has been DEI is dead, but you have large, multinational shareholders upholding what companies are doing on DEI,” she said.

Title: Hong Kong’s Li Ka-shing appears in person for first time since controversial Hutchison ports deal

Friday, 02 May 2025 Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing has made his first in-person public appearance since controversy erupted over his conglomerate’s sale of its overseas ports to a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock amid the US-China trade war, a deal that has drawn Beijing’s ire. The founder of CK Hutchison Holdings visited Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital (HKSH) in Happy Valley on Tuesday to observe a demonstration of a cutting-edge, non-invasive device donated by the Li Ka Shing Foundation for treating liver cancer. “[The hospital] providing this option is definitely great news,” Li said. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The “Histotripsy 2.0” system was delivered to the hospital this month. The 96-year-old tycoon, nicknamed “Superman” for his business acumen and influence, appeared energetic and joyful, grinning while shaking hands with Walton Li Wai-tat, CEO of HKSH Medical Group and medical superintendent of the hospital. The foundation and Temasek Trust, an arm of Singapore’s state investment fund, earlier donated two of the machines, which can remove cancerous tumours with ultrasound waves, to the city state. The Hong Kong tycoon made a rare video appearance during the gifting ceremony earlier this month. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, the University of Hong Kong and Gleneagles Hospital also received the machines, each worth US$3 million. CK Hutchison dropped a bombshell in March when it announced the sale of its 43 overseas ports to a BlackRock-led consortium. The conglomerate is set to receive US$19 billion in cash under the deal. The two ports the conglomerate operates at the Panama Canal have drawn intense scrutiny from both Beijing and Washington, with the strategic waterway becoming a geopolitical flashpoint in the US-China rivalry. CK Hutchison’s shares closed at HK$43.4 (US$5.59) on Tuesday, down 15 per cent from HK$51.55 on March 6, two days after the sale was announced. Li’s elder son and conglomerate chairman, Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, on Monday also made his first public appearance since controversy erupted over the ports deal, appearing at the funeral for late Henderson Land Development founder Lee Shau-kee. Also attending were Wang Zhenmin of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Yin Zonghua of the central government’s liaison office in the city and former chief executive Leung Chun-ying. Liaison office director Zheng Yanxiong and Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu paid their respects the day before. The websites of both the HKMAO and the liaison office have reposted 11 to 12 scathing articles or commentaries against the sale since March 14. The latest, which appeared on Tuesday, warned the parties involved in the sale against sidestepping an antitrust probe amid a report that the two Panama ports could be separated into two deals. Leung last month hit out at “merchants without a motherland”, without naming Li or his company. John Lee also criticised “coercion” in international trade. The State Administration for Market Regulation issued a warning on Sunday over the same report, after saying earlier it would launch an antitrust probe into the deal. China’s foreign ministry on Monday urged all parties in the controversial deal to “act prudently” and stay in touch with Beijing.

Title: The five big challenges facing Germany's next chancellor Friedrich Merz
URL: https://www.thelocal.de/20250502/the-five-big-challenges-facing-germanys-next-chancellor-friedrich-merz
Time Published: 2025-05-02T09:06:29Z
Full Content:
The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Germany’s incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set take office on Tuesday 6th May. Columnist Brian Melican sifts through a daunting in-tray. Which of the pressing issues will the inexperienced Merz prioritise? As expected, the SPD’s membership have voted in favour of entering into coalition with the CDU/CSU, finally clearing the way for the latter’s Friedrich Merz to be elected Chancellor in Bundestag. He should scrape through. Yet between them, the CDU/CSU and SPD have an uncomfortably thin majority of 13. So it will only take a couple of SPD rebels turned off by Merz’ recent flirtations with fascism for his chancellorship to get off to a very wobbly start indeed. A full six months since their outgoing Chancellor Scholz torpedoed his own administration, however, and after keeping everyone waiting for weeks, SPD MPs know that any further delay would be political suicide. And that Germany needs a fully-functioning government again ASAP. It needs this government to hit the ground running, too – even though, despite advanced age and personal wealth, Merz doesn’t have much of relevance to being Chancellor on his CV. He left politics in the mid-2000s without ever having held office and has only been back on the scene in opposition for a few years. His amateurish antics in recent months testify to his lack of experience. So good old Freddy is going to need some real beginner’s luck to get a handle on the intractable problems Germany is facing. In fact, to use a comparison his initials invite, he’s going to need to be political rock-star of the order of Freddie Mercury to handle this overflowing in-tray well. READ ALSO: What's first on the new German government's to-do list ahead of summer? Here are the five most urgent files requiring his attention. 1. The economy Lacking a track record in government, ex-Blackrock executive Merz has traded on his business credentials. He bills himself as a high-flyer (quite literally: he has a pilot’s licence) with an understanding of economic affairs not shared by the bleeding-heart socialists now in his coalition or the dogmatic Greens. Freddy, quite simply, thinks he can rock the economy. But he’s playing to a tough crowd. After almost five years of stagnation and recession, growth has flatlined, unemployment is creeping up year on year, and corporate profits are way down – especially in the all-important car industry. Worse: none of these figures take into account Trump’s tariffs. The reasons for Germany’s woes are clear enough: outdated industries, poor infrastructure, a decreasing number of hours worked. Also, there is our pronounced tendency to national depression. As one of Merz’ CDU predecessors as Chancellor, ‘Father of the Wirtschaftswunder’ Ludwig Erhard, once put it: “Economics is 50 percent psychology.” A real Ludwig fan, Freddie is probably hoping that his warm-up act – that emergency €500-billion package – has got everyone in the mood for take-off and set him off to a flying start. 2. Immigration Immigration is another big issue facing Friedrich Merz – but not in the way he thinks. Merz, of course, campaigned as a hardliner on asylum, channelling Trump with his promises to "close the borders from day one". Unlike The Donald, however, Freddie doesn’t have the presidential authority to rule by decree (though his new Interior Minister would certainly like him to). Also, his SPD coalition partner, the constitutional and European courts, and neighbouring countries like Poland and Austria won’t let him kick migrants out with the butt of a rifle or fly them out to Rwanda. (This is Europe: Italy’s Giorgia Meloni hasn’t even been allowed to send them to Albania.) So having got expectations up, Merz’ real challenge will be to not do or say anything stupid about immigration while keeping the crowd entertained. Changing tune will be made easier by the fact that the previous administration has already taken care of a lot of the dirty work: Germany has been policing its Schengen borders to the maximum since last year and quietly supporting grubby EU pushback deals with neighbouring states like Turkey and Tunisia. READ ALSO: What Germany's new coalition pact means for foreign residents As a result of this, our weak economic performance, and the increasingly xenophobic vibes we’re giving off, immigration to Germany – both illicit and wholly legal – is already falling. Yet will Freddie be able to resist his frequent urges to play ‘Radio Gaga’ here – especially when the next random attack is perpetrated by an asylum seeker or foreign-born terrorist? 3. Healthcare Although the matter got little attention during the fraught election campaign, Germany is on the cusp of a healthcare crisis. Don’t worry: this isn’t the UK, so there’ll be no battlefield medicine in overcrowded A&E departments just yet – and no crazy cuts to crucial research like in the US. What we are already seeing, however, are waves of hospital closures and a very serious shortage of doctors. At the same time, Germans are getting older, frailer, and unhealthier – and have a stubborn tendency to visit doctor’s surgeries too often and get themselves written off sick for too long. Given the state of our economy, we can no longer afford this, so novice Health Minister Nina Warken will now be charged with making them stick to one GP. Good luck with that. Then there is the new electronic patient record, the launch of which has been hurried along by outgoing Health Minister Karl Lauterbach despite serious concerns about data privacy. This is a cybersecurity scandal waiting to happen – and indeed, hackers managed to breach the system just days after it launched. Another area requires urgent action: on current trends, the Pflegeversicherung system of funding social care will be on its knees by next year. So Freddie is going to need to find another load of free money from somewhere in order to avoid a sheer heart attack. READ ALSO: What to know about the roll out of Germany's electronic patient file 4. Defence On the face of it, Merz has already dealt with this thorny issue: his surprise pre-government deal to ditch the debt brake allows for more or less unlimited defence spending. Seemingly, this secures our plans to rearm and sends a signal to both Putin and Trump that Germany’s days of being a pushover and a freeloader are well and truly over. The reality, however, is that even with SPD safe-pair-of-hands Boris Pistorious remaining at the Defence Ministry, the parlous state of our armed forces will still require Merz’ executive attention. For unless there is a total reform of procurement, billions will be spent without much to show for it. Also, wishy-washy plans to kindly ask 18-year-olds to maybe, possibly, please consider service won’t be enough to stop the continued decline in the number of armed personnel we can field. As a self-proclaimed man of business with whom the buck stops, Merz will be expected to personally ensure that we get real bang for said buck – and our boys back into uniform. READ ALSO: What will Germany's new military service look like - and who will it include? 5. Foreign policy One way Merz might well be able to speed up rearmament is by cooperating with NATO partners on a European level: if we all place bulk orders for tanks and shells, for example, the process will be cheaper and quicker. And Merz – who spent a term as an EU parliamentarian back in the early 1990s – looks more aware of the importance of international relations more than his predecessor Scholz, who seemed happy to let Annalena Baerbock take care of foreign affairs while he got on with… well, whatever it was he was doing between 2021 and now. As a result, Germany has sorely neglected its relations with close partners of late – to the extent that, last year, they snubbed a French offer of nuclear protection and even forgot to invite Poland to Joe Biden’s Berlin send-off. In a sign of his interest in rekindling cross-border approaches, Merz has, as the first CDU chancellor since the 1960s, insisted that his party get the Foreign Office. Nevertheless, after five years of self-obsessed behaviour, Germany is no longer as well-liked abroad as it needs to be. So Freddie will need to get things started with a barn-storming number, here. Outgoing chancellors get to request the music the Bundeswehr’s band plays at their leaving ceremony. Schröder went for ‘My way’, Merkel Hildegard Knef’s Für mich soll’s rote Rosen regnen. Olaf Scholz has resisted the temptation to troll the successor he calls ‘Fritze’ (‘Freddie’) with Queen numbers like ‘Another one bites the dust’ – all he wants is a little ‘Respect’ by Aretha Franklin. Yet although he is soon to be champion, my friends, Freddie Merz will still need to pull off a real star turn. Join the conversation in our comments section below.

Title: UC Berkeley Received Six-Figure Donations From CCP Officials, Records Show
URL: https://freebeacon.com/campus/uc-berkeley-received-six-figure-donations-from-ccp-officials-records-show/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T09:00:16Z

The University of California, Berkeley, received donations from a blacklisted Chinese research university, Chinese Communist Party officials, and a Beijing state-owned chemical company, according to records obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The news comes days after the Trump administration launched an investigation into UC Berkeley for allegedly failing to disclose funding from China, including a $220 million government investment in Berkeley’s joint research institution with Tsinghua University. Donor records obtained through a California public information request provide new details on Berkeley’s financial relationship with China and foreign government-linked donors. Section 117 of the Higher Education Act requires that American universities disclose the names and locations of foreign donors to the federal government. For four years, the Biden administration failed to strictly enforce the law and withheld donor names from the American public. As the Free Beacon reported, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month requiring more thorough disclosures. The Berkeley records demonstrate that the administration’s more aggressive approach to foreign higher education donations appears likely to reveal unsavory financial backers. One of the university’s donors is the University of Science and Technology of China, which gave Berkeley $60,000 for its chemistry program in 2023. A year after the donation, the U.S. Department of Commerce added USTC to its sanctions list for "acquiring and attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of advancing China's quantum technology capabilities, which has serious ramifications for U.S. national security given the military applications of quantum technologies." Berkeley also received $336,000 for its "research units" in 2023 from Vincent Cheung Sai Sing, a longtime member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference for Shanghai City, an advisory body to the Chinese Communist Party. The GS Charity Foundation Limited, the charitable arm of the Glorious Sun Group, gave $160,000 to Berkeley for international studies research in 2023. The Glorious Sun Group’s chairman, Charles Yeung, was also a member of the CCP national people’s committee. Duane Ziping Kuang, the founding managing partner of China-based venture capital firm Qiming Venture Partners, gave $75,000 to Berkeley’s business school. His firm was an early investor in ByteDance. Several universities have listed gifts from China-linked donors as coming from other countries, as the Free Beacon has previously reported. Berkeley reported numerous donations from PRC-associated individuals as originating elsewhere. Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire founder of CK Hutchison, donated $5.7 million to Berkeley’s biological sciences division in 2023. The funding was reported as coming from Canada, where Li Ka-shing has a foundation. Li, whose business empire has deep ties to the Chinese government, is at the center of the U.S.-China trade dispute over the Panama Canal. President Trump has cited CK Hutchinson’s ownership of the waterway’s port operations as evidence that China is "operating the Panama Canal," and vowed to take it back. The Chinese government, meanwhile, threatened to cripple Li’s business interests if he went forward with a plan to sell his Panama Canal operations to a consortium led by BlackRock. In 2023 and 2024, Berkeley reported receiving $50,000 from Sky9 Capital Fund V in the Cayman Islands. Sky9 Capital, a China-focused venture capital fund, has financed ByteDance, TikTok, Meituan, and other companies closely associated with the CCP. Syngenta, a Chinese state-owned company, donated $21,000 to Berkeley’s Rausser College of Natural Resources in 2022. The university listed the money as coming from Switzerland, where Syngenta is headquartered. A spokesman for Berkeley declined to comment on the specific donations. He said the university is "reviewing the Department of Education inquiry and will cooperate with its federal partners as has long been our practice. The university prioritizes direct communications with legislative committees and governmental agencies when responding to their questions and inquiries."

May 02, 2025 01:30 ET | Source: Danske Bank A/S Danske Bank A/S Solid results for the first quarter of 2025 driven by good customer activity across the business and strong credit quality in an uncertain global environmentNet profit of DKK 5.8 billion. Carsten Egeriis, Chief Executive Officer, comments on the financial results: “For Danske Bank, the first quarter of 2025 was a continuation of our satisfactory and stable performance in 2024. We delivered solid results in line with our expectations, driven by a steady development in core income and a stable cost level. In addition, credit quality remained strong, and this resulted in low loan impairments. Our solid financial results and capital position enable us to be a strong financial partner that offers expert advice and helps our customers and society navigate the uncertainty. We continue to invest in technology and customer offerings, and we are well on track to meet our targets and to deliver on our Forward ’28 strategy.” Solid financial performance In a challenging market environment, we continued our work to deliver on our strategic ambitions and achieved a strong return on shareholders’ equity of 13.3% in the first quarter of 2025, up from 12.9% in the first quarter of 2024, while also reducing the cost/income ratio from 45.4% to 45.2%. Net profit increased 2% to DKK 5.76 billion as a result of an 8% increase in net fee income, driven by solid customer demand for cash management and everyday banking activities, a 15% increase in net trading income, which also benefited from good customer activity, as well as lower operating expenses and low loan impairment charges. The increases in net fee income and net trading income were partly offset by slightly lower net interest income due to rate cuts and the divestment of the personal customer business in Norway as well as lower net income from insurance business, which was affected by a one-off provision. The improvement was based on strong business customer activity as our Business Customers and Large Corporates & Institutions units both saw solid growth in lending volumes and an expanding customer base, underpinning core income line increases. Continuously good demand for our products from personal customers in Denmark resulted, among other things, in an increase in deposits as well as in the market share of bank lending. We have therefore seen a stable performance, despite the divestment of the personal customer business in Norway, as deposit growth and the rise in net fee income due to strong customer activity partially offset the effect of interest rates coming down. Sustainability remains a core pillar of our Forward ’28 strategy, and we have published our Climate Action Plan Progress Report 2024, which provides an update on the Group’s climate targets set in January 2023. “Thanks to our strong capital and liquidity positions, we continue to support our customers in these uncertain times, as evidenced by our Q1 results. We saw a solid financial performance, driven in particular by strong business customer activity, which resulted in stable core banking income and higher net trading income. The increase in net profit was supported by stable costs and a low level of impairments,” says Cecile Hillary, Chief Financial Officer. First quarter 2025 vs first quarter 2024 Total income of DKK 13.9 billion (DKK 14.0 billion in the first quarter of 2024) Operating expenses of DKK 6.3 billion (DKK 6.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024) Loan impairments of DKK 50 million (DKK 101 million in the first quarter of 2024) Net profit of DKK 5.8 billion (DKK 5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024) Return on shareholders’ equity of 13.3% (12.9% in the first quarter of 2024) Strong capital generation further supported capital ratios: Total capital ratio of 22.9 % and CET1 capital ratio of 18.4% (total capital ratio of 23.0% and CET1 capital ratio of 18.5% in the first quarter of 2024) Stable economies in uncertain environment Danske Bank’s results for the first quarter of 2025 highlight the resilience of the Nordic economies amid global uncertainty. In the first quarter of 2025, we saw an increasingly promising outlook for growth and inflation and robust employment across the Nordic countries. Although household credit demand remained modest, consumer spending continued to hold up well throughout the Nordic countries, despite the higher degree of uncertainty. Globally, US tariffs and potential retaliatory measures have created significant uncertainty regarding global growth prospects. While a potential risk of recession is highlighted in the US, a more moderate impact is expected on European growth, including in the Nordic countries. “A trade war and tariffs are likely to dampen growth in the Nordic countries, but the foundation is still in place for a decent economic outlook, as many interest rates have been lowered, real incomes are increasing and export markets other than the US continue to grow,” says Las Olsen, Head of Macro Research. Personal Customers Despite challenges, the housing market in Denmark showed consistent growth, and signs of recovery emerged in Finland, while Sweden’s housing market continued to face difficulties. Profit before tax for Personal Customers decreased 18% relative to the level in the first quarter of 2024 and amounted to DKK 2.25 billion. The decrease was due mainly to higher loan impairment charges. Additionally, both income and operating expenses were affected by the divestment of our personal customer business in Norway. We concluded negotiations with Blackrock to implement their Aladdin Wealth platform to enhance investment services and improved the digital self-service tools that customers use to manage their mortgages. Business Customers In the first quarter of 2025, we expanded our customer base in the mid-sized segment across the Nordic markets and grew our business with international subsidiaries. Profit before tax amounted to DKK 2.83 billion and increased 64% from the level in the same period last year, primarily on the back of loan impairment reversals and increased net fee income, although the increase was to some degree offset by lower income from our leasing company.

Profit before tax decreased to DKK 2.4 billion, or 12% relative to the level in the same period last year, due to higher loan impairment charges, although the return on allocated capital before impairments increased to 27.2%. Danica Danica experienced a decrease in net income from insurance business to DKK 201 million in the first quarter of 2025, a fall of 59% from DKK 492 million in the same period last year. This was due primarily to a decrease in the insurance service result, which was impacted by provisions related to legacy life insurance products in run-off and more expensive claims in the health and accident business, partly offset by adjustment of an accrued interest income. The return on customer pension savings was impacted by large volatility in the equity markets, but bonds and alternative investments saw a more stable development. Northern Ireland Profit before tax increased 32% to DKK 602 million, reflecting strong growth in net interest income and net impairment recoveries. Profit before impairments was 15% higher than for the same period in 2024. Outlook for 2025 We maintain our guidance and expect net profit to be in the range of DKK 21-23 billion.

Title: Elon Musk Likely To Integrate Crypto Into X ‘Super App’, Says Scaramucci

Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and a long-time crypto advocate, believes Elon Musk is poised to weave digital assets into the fabric of X’s planned “super app,” even if the precise mechanism remains under wraps. In a recent interview with Saxo Group, Scaramucci disclosed that although he has “not spoken to Elon directly,” he maintains an investor’s line of sight into SpaceX, xAI and X after taking stakes in all three ventures. “I do speak to people in management in those two companies as a private investor,” he said, adding that he owns no Tesla shares. Based on those conversations, the former White House communications director predicts that Musk will soon pivot from headline-grabbing political skirmishes back to the operational overhaul of X. “I predict that Musk returns to his businesses… and I do think that you will see X-XL—whatever you want to call that conglomeration—he’s going to build a super app there and I think he’s going to be using crypto,” Scaramucci remarked. The SkyBridge chief outlined several possible rails for this integration. “Will it be his own coin the way Telegram is doing it? Will it be stable-coin? It will be something. I don’t know what it will be but it will be something.” His comments arrived despite Musk’s earlier insistence that “none of his companies will ever launch a native crypto token,” underscoring the open question of whether X will opt for existing assets such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin or stablecoins, or instead pursue a bespoke digital instrument. Scaramucci’s forecasts are anchored in Musk’s well-publicised ambition to turn X into what he once called “the biggest financial institution in the world.” In 2023 the Tesla and SpaceX chief invoked China’s WeChat as a model for integrating messaging, payments and business services. The first concrete step toward that vision emerged earlier this year when X announced a partnership with Visa for an X Money Account, a digital wallet designed to shuttle funds between bank accounts and the app’s peer-to-peer rails. Beyond the Musk-X thesis, Scaramucci used the Saxo Group interview to reiterate his broader market convictions. He credited the Trump administration for their pro-crypto policies. “There is going to be crypto-friendly, pro-crypto regulation. I see that as very positive,” he stated. He also repeated his stance that bitcoin’s twin role as an inflation hedge and risk asset would remain intact should a recession materialise: “We’re finally seeing this non-correlation where it’s trading a little bit like gold, which is outperforming, but it’s trading a little bit like gold in the last three weeks. And I think this is a direct result of the Wall Street sales machine. I think you have an enormous amount of inflows taking place in the BlackRock ETF and other ETFs.” At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.177. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Why Two Prime Is Going BTC Only

Full Content:
ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. ETH Price Has Fallen Sharply Against BTC Over the Past Year Over the past six months, BTC and ETH have started acting like two distinct assets. BTC has remained robust and consistent. Meanwhile, ETH has started to behave more like a memecoin and has lost momentum on many fronts. ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have made it difficult for institutions to continue to engage. The risk-reward is hard to justify and the momentum of statistics like new developers and users is moving in the wrong direction as compared to competitors. The data suggests ETH has fundamentally changed. It has de-correlated from BTC and added much greater tail risk. It trades now like a memecoin rather than a predictable asset. Even during the turbulence of Q1 2025, bitcoin remained within its fundamental behavior, whereas ETH saw several multi-standard deviation moves. This comes from a risk-off environment and a general capitulation of long-term ETH holders on the asset. For both algorithmic trading and ETH-backed lending, this creates a headache as the asset no longer behaves predictably, even by the high volatility expectations of digital asset markets. ETH 30 day v 30 day forward return shows little mean reversion or positive momentum This chart shows 30-day vs. 30-day forward returns. It is a method for observing an asset's momentum. Dots in the lower left quadrant mean that the asset is moving in a negative direction. Assets that hover near the middle show mean reversion characteristics. Since the election in November of 2024, ETH has shown very little rebound and a lot of negative momentum. Meanwhile, bitcoin has largely reverted, meaning people are “buying the dip.” With ETH, they are not. Historically, these two assets have been highly correlated, but that is no longer the case. This makes sense as the assets are actually quite different and simply share the fact that they both operate on a blockchain. 30 day volatility of ETH has started to behave more like DOGE In this chart, we observe the amount of volatility over a 30-day period for BTC, ETH, and DOGE. High volatility can be profitable at times, but for institutional investors and traders, higher levels of volatility equate to lower position sizing. As the chart shows, ETH volatility has behaved more like DOGE than BTC since the start of the year. This makes institutional participation less attractive, suggesting declining trading volumes and market depth. BTC ETF AUM Has Far Outpaced Both Gross Performance and As % of Total Supply Lastly, we can see that ETF buying of BTC has far outpaced that of ETH by almost 24 times. Even with a higher market cap, BTC total supply consumed by ETFs is more than double that of the ETH supply. The real demand here may even be overstated for ETH, as much of this buying is likely offset by short futures positions by traders engaging in the basis trade for delta-neutral yield. For digital assets to survive, they must find a meaningful bid from mainstream retail and institutional participants. The failure of ETH’s ETF creates a reflexive loop whereby institutions like BlackRock dedicate fewer resources to their promotion and sale. BTC has found the mainstream while ETH has floundered. Narratives do matter, though. Unlike BTC, ETH’s value prop is to be a Turing-complete decentralized computer. It aims to allow all types of decentralized applications to be built and operate on the platform. However, though ETH had a first-mover advantage and benefited from network effects of scale, many rising competitors have better fundamental technology and the ability to monetize. The most obvious example is Solana. Without getting too deep into the data, Solana and others offer faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and a better user experience than ETH. For some slow transactions, ETH works perfectly fine, but for others that require near-zero latency, like gaming or payments, ETH simply can’t compete. Further, the business model has essentially allowed ETH L2s to cannibalize almost all of the monetization of this infrastructure. How does something produce ongoing value if it can’t explain how it makes money? As a result, it has lost significant market share to Solana and others over the past few years, judged by the number of active developers, daily active users of products, and price appreciation. ETH has many competitors with better fundamental offerings for speed and cost Finally, and most subjectively, the vibes are just wrong. From my perspective, ETH became a victim of its early success, growing into a bureaucratic and ideological organization rather than one focused on building a tech product. The lack of strong leadership and clear focus has led to mission creep, with no single thing being done particularly well, and decisions being hindered by slow processes. While decentralization is a pleasant ideal, competitive start-up markets require efficient leadership. As digital assets become more deeply ingrained in the mainstream, most people are largely unconcerned about the speed and block size sacrifices that ETH makes for security. They do not care about the egalitarian governance values that paralyze making changes to the technology. They want a product that works. They want an investment that outperforms. Bitcoin stands alone in its use case. It has no competitor in digital assets. This has been reflected by statements from finance leaders like Blackrock’s Larry Fink, Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Strategy CEO, Michael Saylor. Bitcoin aims to be one thing, and it does it well. Institutions flock to economies and assets that are consistent and predictable. Bitcoin growth of hashrate, institutional buyers, distribution, and price all trend positively and consistently. The existing scale of the asset and the remaining upside of global adoption make BTC a far better risk-weighted investment than ETH. This can be seen in both measures of network growth and how the asset trades statistically. ETH and its competitors are essentially speculative tech startups fighting for market share. The issue for ETH and its leadership is that everyone but them seems to know that.

Title: Things to Do in Isengard When You’re Dead

Okay, I wasn’t actually dead, but I wasn’t doing very well. Being in Isengard, you might as well be dead because… and this is the truth about most evil places… it is so dull and tedious. I mean, seriously, being dropped into Isengard leads you to a series of the most annoyingly repetitive quests I’ve ever been faced with. The devs wanted you to experience peon life. The Ring of Isengard But I didn’t know that when I arrived. All I knew then was that I wanted to be in Rohan and not Isengard… also, I wondered if I might have avoided this by just leaving the quest and the instance that contained it behind. In fact, a lot of things went through my head when the game suddenly yoinked me to Isengard, both wondering how I even got there… just more cut scene magic… and how I could get out. As a hunter I supposed I could just use one of my many travel skills and time skip or dimension shift or whatever it is that lets me travel between places instantaneously. But I also figured I was there, I ought to go see what is up. In Isengard, as in every place in Middle-earth when a well armed drifter with a history of violence shows up, their first inclination was to put me to work. They didn’t even disarm me or put me in an orange prison jump suit. There were several times when I just up and killed a White Hand orc that turned out to be aggro because I went down the wrong path. All they did was assigned me a case officer to track my progress and then sent me off to work. What makes Isengard so tedious is simply the amount of running around you have to do to accomplish some of your tasks. You start up in the ring, then get down to the depths, where end up running between the forges, the kitchens, the dungeons, the barracks, and occasionally back to the surface, to the ring. The Isengard Depths There are no short cuts and, while they’ve left you with all your gear, you cannot ride a mount in there. So it is running all the way… though I did figure out part way through that when you off some random orc who is attackable… most are not… you get a speed buff. Talk about your perverse incentive structures. So you spend time in the forges lifting and carrying barrels of weapons and armor and collecting stuff of the floor. The weapons and armor won’t put themselves in the barrels Then it is over to the kitchens to clean slop up off the floor. After five years of service they give me a brush Don’t worry, the slop all goes into the slop bucket, which is used to feed the prisoners… and the orcs again. Then you end up taking some of the slop down to the dungeons to feed the prisoners, which you do by tossing a bucket full of slop in their general direction. Then it is back up to the forges. Heading back from the dungeons The whole place has a bit of a Blackrock Depths air to it… except you’re on staff and keeping the locals supplied. Then it is back up to the surface for another delivery. At one point my name was called to go have an audience with Saruman. He knows my name… I don’t think he recognized me from the auction, so someone likely prompted him…and starts off trying to neg me so I’ll be eager to please him or something. The battle but not the war old man! Then he tried to use the voice on me, trying to get me to join his team. Again, when a well armed drifter with a history of violence shows up, everybody seems to have a positions available for applicants with those qualifications. However, I typed in /resist, which is apparently all you need to defeat his voice. Actually, the quest tracker has a button that will do it for you. It is just that easy. So I keep resisting his questions, like where the ring is, what Gandalf knows, who played The Cisco Kid, and how to throw a knuckle ball. Frustrated by my lack of response and my ability to press a button, he went down another path. He brought in a woman keen to kill me, and not even one of my ex-girlfriends. Kill Tistann? Dare I live the NPC dream? Apparently she had been following Lothrandir and I, she being the mob we faced during the whole mustering of the Grey Company series of quests, whom I had failed to even acknowledge during my summary of the events. All I put down in my post was: Then there was a run through Forochel that was mercifully quick and Lothrandir was soon on his way to Rivendell. This was Gun Ain, which means “without name” or “white wood” or something like that (and is just one typo away from being “Gun Aim”), whom we faced after walking through a short ice maze, and who seemed kind of whiny at the time. Otherwise she didn’t really register with me. I took more screen shots of Calenglad girlfriend than I did on the ice caves tour with Lothrandir. Basically all I have from the ice cave trip with Captain Obvious I even took a screen shot of Lothrandir’s quest comments and he didn’t bother to mention her. I can just see in the text scroll back in that screen shot that he left her some food, so you think she might be a little more on our side. But no. Still, I have to give credit for an epic quest line call back. It wasn’t at the Sara Oakheart level of returns, but it was something. Anyway, Saruman decided to give me some time to think about his offer before letting her slay me, so it was back out into the ring for another full day of toting and carrying. Saruman negging me one last time Along the way the two prisoners I was hurling slop at during my trip to the dungeons, Baldcar and Acca, suggested to me a cunning plan. On my next visit to the forges, in addition to picking up weapons and armor, they wanted me to pick up some of this mysterious black powder and pocket it. Once I did that and checked back in with them, they sent me off to the ring to plant the black powder around one of the huge siege engines. Then when I got back it was time to find the guard with the key and get that so I could let everybody out for the great big jail break. Also, I poisoned some orcs and bribed somebody with some decent food along the way. So I break everybody out and there is a rousing “let’s do this!” speech and then we start moving into the ring in groups of two or three as Acca suggested and I am now keen to see how this escape plan is going to work. I mean, seriously, this had better be freaking good. All we’ve done is steal some black powder, sprinkle it around a siege engine, and then… get ready? So, in my head I am imagining all sorts of wild scenarios of escape, from simple diversion to maybe using a catapult to fling us over the walls and into some trees where maybe we meet ents or something. Baldcar, Acca, and I walk casually through the whole place… again… and then get to a spot a ways from the siege engine, where Acca tells us to wait While we’re waiting, Baldcar mentions that his first task on escaping will be to report in to Theodred, after which he says we’ll get back to the Falcon Clan and that city of traitors. (“City of Traitors” is one of the quest names when we get to that, though it is barely a settlement or encampment of miscreants when you get down to measures.) Via a Ouija board? In my head I respond, “Theodred? Theodan’s dead son? What are you, a clairvoyant?” then realize again that I am effectively a time traveler in this world. I’ve seen all this play out before. It is a good thing the NPCs can’t hear me. Baldcar rambles on a bit, then decides Acca is taking too long. So we run off to find Acca dead at the feet of one of the overseers who suspects something is going on. Baldcar offers to carry a message, then indicates to me with obvious phrasing, several over eye winks, a waggling of eyebrows, all while using both hands to make giant air quotes before him, that the plan is going forward and that he will start the distraction and that I need to keep our friend busy. Busy means fighting him and, for some bizarre reason, I think I need to draw the fight out to give Baldcar time, while in hindsight I am sure all I had to do was hit a damage threshold on the big orc to trigger the next phase. Then, after dancing around trying to draw the fight out, I just unload so we can get to the big escape event. And then there is a loading screen, after which, you’re just out in the woods in Dunland again. This was an epic hand wave on the level of the Monty Python episode The Cycling Tour where Pither is facing certain death in the face of the Russian firing squad and then a card is displayed that says something like “Scene Missing” and Gulliver and Pither are back on a road in Cornwall. Color me disappointed… as well as being completely unable to tell you HOW we escaped in anything by the most vague terms. Also, when we land in Dunland, in the woods, once more, Baldcar is badly wounded and apparently I have carried his ass all this way as part of the miraculous escape, then promptly dies on me, negating whatever effort I put in. But his last words were to not seek the treasure… no… to seek Theodred and, resisting the temptation to suggest he might be seeing Theodred soon enough, I swear to honor his wishes. After all, the quest indicates I get to wrap this up by turning in the quest to Theodred, so I am going there anyways. Sure enough, Theodred is there, as foretold by prophecy and the quest text, alive and ready for action. Theodred in Dunland I was now ready to head towards Rohan! Then Theodred reminded me that the rest of the Grey Company, from Halbarad on down, were still locked up by the Falcon Clan. He said we should go rescue them, and I agreed, if only to close out this book in the epic quest line. But that is for another post. Overall, Isengard was a strange and often tedious interlude. It got in some exposition and we got to meet Saruman up close and personal and I got a nice little Isengard Prisoner cosmetic outfit that is suitable for Halloween. Me playing prisoner I can’t say it was worth the effort, but it was a thing. Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Why Saylor’s Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Buys Barely Move The Price, Expert Explains

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a explainer video, Joe Burnett, Director of Market Research at the Bitcoin-native financial services firm Unchained, dissects what many retail traders still perceive as a paradox: how Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) can accumulate “tens of thousands of Bitcoins” without catapulting the spot price into a vertical climb. Burnett’s core argument is that Michael Saylor’s billion-dollar shopping sprees are not the direct injection of fresh demand they appear to be, but rather a sophisticated reallocation of existing exposure within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Burnett opens by reminding viewers that Bitcoin’s explosive move “from the $16,000 lows of 2022 to $95,000 today” has historically been accompanied by the awakening of dormant supply. He points to on-chain “hodl wave” data, noting that when price accelerates, “older coins start to move,” a signal that seasoned holders are willing to part with inventory into strength. Those coins, he says, “transfer…to new hands,” a cohort he defines broadly as “Strategy, ETF buyers, institutions, nation-states, and of course, more individuals.” Strategy sits squarely in that cohort, yet Burnett stresses that the software company’s trading style is calibrated to minimize market disturbance. “They use a disciplined, patient strategy, placing thousands or even millions of small buy orders over several days,” he says, quoting Saylor’s own public comments that the firm prefers letting “sellers come to them without bidding against themselves.” The tactic allows long-term, arguably less-price-sensitive holders to exchange coins for cash without triggering runaway order-book imbalances. The video’s analytical pivot arrives when Burnett introduces what he calls an “additional theory” on why Strategy’s purchases fail to ignite parabolic price action: the funding structure. He unpacks it with a simple but pointed analogy. “If you sell one Bitcoin on Kraken and buy one Bitcoin on Coinbase, what happens to the price? Nothing,” he states. “That’s an economically neutral trade.” According to Burnett, Strategy’s balance-sheet maneuvers replicate that neutrality on a corporate scale. When the firm raises cash by issuing new equity, “someone buys that stock instead of buying Bitcoin,” Burnett explains. Strategy then turns the equity proceeds into spot BTC. “Net effect? A shift in exposure. No net new demand.” The same mechanics, he argues, apply to the company’s convertible-note programs. Hedge funds that subscribe to the notes simultaneously hedge by short-selling MSTR shares, expanding float rather than siphoning dollars from unrelated asset classes. “In both cases… the dollars that flow into Bitcoin are first pulled out of a Bitcoin proxy, MSTR shares,” he says, underscoring the zero-sum nature of the flow. Burnett likens the dynamic to the cash migration that followed the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024. Billions poured into products from BlackRock and Fidelity, but “billions also flowed out of GBTC,” he notes, leaving aggregate demand for Bitcoin largely unchanged: “From A to B. Not new demand.” What, then, would constitute price-moving capital? Burnett’s answer is unequivocal: money that “enters Bitcoin without exiting another Bitcoin proxy.” He cites hypotheticals ranging from Apple’s treasury to sovereign wealth funds, or individuals reallocating real-estate and bond holdings directly into BTC. Against that benchmark, Strategy’s transactions look more like intra-system plumbing than fresh inflows. None of this, Burnett emphasizes, should be read as criticism of Saylor. He calls the Strategy chairman “a world-class Bitcoin educator” whose accumulation strategy is “brilliant.” Yet the market impact, Burnett cautions, “is more nuanced than [it may] appear.” In fact, he suggests that the upcoming Saylor-branded STRF funds—which target fixed-income investors rather than equity buyers—could deliver the genuine outside capital that finally “sends the price of Bitcoin parabolic.” Until such exogenous demand materializes, the Bitcoin market is likely to keep absorbing Strategy’s billion-dollar bids with surprising calm. In Burnett’s words, “Saylor can buy a lot of Bitcoin without moving the price much because he’s buying from long-term wealthy holders and doing so in a way that minimizes short-term price impact.” For traders who expected fireworks each time the software company files a new 8-K, that explanation may prove as sobering as it is illuminating.

Title: Best Presales to Buy as Institutional Flows Return to Bitcoin, Says BlackRock

As BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick put it during a Token2049 panel in Dubai with VanEck and CME Group, ‘Flows are back in a big way.’ And he’s not just being optimistic – there’s data to back it up. Bitcoin ETFs, which had cooled off earlier this year, are now seeing renewed inflows as institutional investors pile back in. Mitchnick’s comments reflect a broader industry shift: the financial elite once again embrace Bitcoin and crypto assets. This institutional momentum is helping revive market sentiment and sparking a new wave of enthusiasm across the industry. With the landscape heating up, especially for Bitcoin and related assets, early-stage projects are riding this bullish wave. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy right now, these four best presales deserve a closer look. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme coin with real teeth – and actual Bitcoin behind the bark. It’s a community-powered project built around one bold idea: that Bitcoin is headed for $1M. With over $5.2M already raised in its presale and growing momentum, $BTCBULL aims to be the meme coin that delivers value, not just laughs. Instead of just cheering from the sidelines, $BTCBULL lets investors ride the rally and earn actual Bitcoin along the way. Here’s how it works: every time Bitcoin hits a major milestone – like $125K, $150K, $175K and beyond – one of two things happens. Holders are rewarded with real $BTC airdrops, and the $BTCBULL token supply gets burned. This creates scarcity and pumps value. That’s not just hype. That’s tokenomics with real muscle. But there’s a catch: to get those juicy airdrops, you need to buy $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and keep it there. No Best Wallet, no Bitcoin rewards. Fortunately, frictionless integration with Best Wallet means you don’t need to mess with clunky Bitcoin wallets or BRC-20 headaches – just buy, HODL, and forget about it until the presale ends. And with institutional inflows surging back into Bitcoin ETFs, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s performance are catching serious tailwinds. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn’t just another utility coin – it’s the native token powering one of the most ambitious attempts to overhaul the way we interact with Web3. While legacy apps like MetaMask still feel stuck in the early days of DeFi, Best Wallet is stepping up as the next-gen solution for crypto holders who want more: more security, more simplicity, and more features. With demand rising and early access perks still on the table, now is the perfect time to buy $BEST before the next price jump leaves latecomers behind. Early birds get the worm and all that. Why? Because the underlying wallet isn’t vaporware – it’s already live and loaded with tools like ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ which lets users access vetted presales directly in-app, cutting out scammy third-party sites and mirror links. And with renewed institutional interest in crypto led by players like BlackRock, as highlighted in this recent update, $BEST is launching at just the right moment to catch the next big wave of highly profitable coins. But it doesn’t stop there. $BEST holders enjoy perks like reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto launches, and even iGaming rewards like free spins and exclusive bonuses. With its clean UI, real utility, and a growing community, Best Wallet is shaping up to be much more than just another app – and $BEST is the key to unlocking everything it offers. Qubetics ($TICS) is one of the most promising new projects aiming to fix one of crypto’s biggest problems: blockchains don’t talk to each other. Think of it as the translator of the blockchain world. By connecting blockchains, Qubetics makes it easier for apps (and dApps), users, and businesses to move assets and data across chains without friction. It also comes with a built-in DeFi wallet and decentralized VPN, giving users more control, privacy, and protection – features that appeal especially to institutions looking for security and compliance. At a current price of $0.20931054 and with $16.5M already raised in presale, $TICS is picking up steam fast. And with institutional capital flowing back into crypto, this infrastructure-focused project is in the right place at the right time. Arctic Pablo ($APC) is a meme coin that blends viral energy with smart tokenomics to deliver real value in a crowded space. Currently priced at $0.00011, the project has already raised over $2.3M in its presale, a strong signal that investors are paying attention. The presale itself is creatively designed like a journey, with each stage representing a different ‘location.’ As users progress through stages, the token price increases, rewarding early movers. But what really sets $APC apart is its deflationary model. Each week, all unsold tokens from the active stage are burned, shrinking the supply and increasing scarcity (something that BTC Bull Token also does). This combination of community, creativity, and utility makes Arctic Pablo one of the best altcoins positioned to thrive in a market where institutional capital is flowing back into crypto, as BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick recently pointed out. The return of institutional capital to crypto isn’t just reviving Bitcoin – it’s fueling a wave of high-potential projects bound to take the market by storm. From infrastructure-driven $TICS and utility-focused $BEST, to Bitcoin-pegged $BTCBULL and meme-fueled $APC, this cycle is lighting up every corner of the market. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy during this transitional phase, these new crypto projects represent more than hype – they’re early entry points into the next generation of crypto narratives.
