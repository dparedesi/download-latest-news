Tom Gilsenan Terry Healy JF Sir — It was great to see last week’s Sunday Independent acknowledging some of the people who for years have been regular writers to your Letters page (‘Dear Sir’, People & Culture). These familiar names, the correspondents who have provided us with lots of entertainment, debate and sometimes controversy on a wide range of topics. This is what makes your Letters page such unmissable reading, and for me often the most interesting page. It was so nice to hear your letter writers’ motivation and interests and put a face to these talented people. I have to commend the way your paper never flinches from publishing letters from readers criticising articles in previous editions. Brian Lube, Co Meath Sir — I thoroughly enjoyed the letter writers article. It was wonderful to finally put faces to the names of those prolific writers. The fourth wall has been broken and has revealed an ageing demographic, one whose connection to the written word is more deeply ingrained then those who might come after them. Such a striking revelation is not to be taken lightly — it is a reflection of the times, and the printed page is showing its age. We live in a TikTok generation where the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Although this future is uncertain, my hope is that the art of letter writing will endure, and tangible, well-crafted thoughts and opinions will prevail — that these words, written by anyone, will continue to be addressed to everyone. Elliot McCarthy, The Tower, Cork Sir — Your piece profiling 10 regular contributors to the Letters page was illuminating. It’s nice to put faces to so many familiar names, including a few that I’ve had the pleasure of sparring with over the years. However, readers of the article would be forgiven for thinking letter writing is the preserve of those enjoying or approaching retirement. On the contrary, some of us are 30 and younger, have 15 years’ worth of published letters under our belts and entertain hopes there are many more to come. Letter writing as a pastime and a therapy has multi-generational appeal. Killian Foley-Walsh, Kilkenny city Sir — Ah, stop the lights. I’ve just opened my Sunday Indo and there he is in the flesh, none other than the mysterious Tom Gilsenan. The number of times I have asked myself, “Who the hell is this Tom Gilsenan constantly getting published?”, before eventually concluding he was actually a journalist in disguise — possibly far more talented and interesting, I might add. Keep them coming, Tom, now I know you are not some kind of bot masquerading as a human. Seriously, you generally hit the nail on the head. Well done you, and fair play to Roslyn Dee, whom I adore as a columnist. Breeda Geraghty, Shrule, Co Mayo Sir — Roslyn Dee’s piece was fascinating. In the St Petersburg Times in 1951, PG Wodehouse wrote: “I yearn to write letters to the papers. All authors do. Novelists are merely those who have failed as contributors to the Correspondence Column. Unable to make the grade, they drop down a rung on the ladder and write novels.” Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin Sir — I’m not entirely sure how I feel about seeing the faces of fellow letter writers to national newspapers. A bit like Bansky, the pseudo­nymous street artist, not really knowing who is behind the art is part of the fascination of seeing letters appear in print — at least for me. Nevertheless, I have to take my hat off to the witticisms of Tom Gilsenan, who clearly is a fan of Beckett — less is more. And to Mary Stewart from Donegal, whose political views would differ from mine. She once had a go at me in print for criticising something David Quinn wrote — called me a “Lumiere”. As a lover of the big screen, I viewed that as a compliment of the highest order. Thank you, Mary! Finally, to the editor, who put Tournageehy firmly on the map. My father would be proud. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Listowel, Co Kerry Sir — I was delighted to see letter writers being recognised and written about. I was once referred to as “your prolific letter writer”. My prolific days ended, as happenings in life began to take a toll, but I am now hopeful of attempting to continue the joy of writing letters to the editor, starting with this particular one, be it published or not. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Sir — Thanks a million for featuring the brilliant letter writers. It was great to see the faces with the names. While I loved the piece by Roslyn Dee about me, I did not recognise myself in the photo. So I’m sending you one of myself taken four weeks ago. Perhaps you could print it with this letter? (See above). Terry Healy Riordan, Kill, Co Kildare Sir — Sarah Caden’s very ­welcome interview with Helen Joyce (People & Culture, April 13) could not have been more timely, coming as it did on the same day we learnt a legal action seeking a judicial review of the State’s treatment of children with gender identity issues is due to come before the High Court. Helen Joyce had a significant career in maths and journalism, but took up the task of challenging gender identity ideology and its ramifications. She is one of the most prominent figures called on to speak in defence of the rights of women and the need to safeguard the interests of children from being misled by activists and others in authority. There is no room for compla­cency here either, and the ­Government needs to educate ­itself about the risks of promoting this ideology. The fallout from this is ­already being seen in other countries, with a growing number of adults now realising they have been harmed irreversibly through the use of hormones and possibly surgery when they were younger. Further risk to Irish children might be avoided if those in positions of authority in the HSE, teaching and ­politics heed the warnings by Helen Joyce and others of the dangers posed by this ideology, which has led to this medical scandal. Thank you for bringing attention to the work of this tremendous woman, one whom we can be proud to call our own. Jill Nesbitt, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was engaging, but for me what was surprising was your statement that “no Irish media outlet had interviewed the bestselling [Irish] author”. Why not? The UK Supreme Court has just ruled that a woman is someone born at birth as biologically ­female. It has been described as a “commonsense decision”. Yet the Irish political class cannot tell us what a woman is. Their verbal somersaults are at best amusing, especially in light of the Cass Report. It is almost a year since Jacky Grainger (Sunday Independent interview, May 4, 2024) beseeched the political class to find the “courage and integrity” to slay the gender ideology gripping the state and put children’s health and lives at the forefront of policy. Sadly, the gender ideological tectonic plates have not yet moved. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was a delight: Joyce has been effectively cancelled by the Irish media for so long because of her rational and sensible views on the trans issue. Hopefully, now you have broken the spell, we may see and hear more from Joyce and others who support women’s rights. Similarly, RTÉ might now have the courage to interview other gender-critical writers and activists, rather than the one-­sided propaganda that has been pushed unopposed for so long. Julia Anderson, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — I was delighted that you finally interviewed Helen Joyce. She eloquently expresses views of the majority of people — that humans can’t change sex; that women and girls deserve single sex spaces, services and sports; that gender non-conforming children are not born in the wrong body and don’t need to be medically and surgically ‘fixed’; and that forcing lesbians to accept men who identify as women into their dating pool is modern-day gay conversion therapy. Unless our politicians and organisations recognise this, we are facing further dismantling of women’s and gay rights and of child safeguarding. Elena Brooks, Glenageary, Co Dublin Sir — Helen Joyce is a mathematician. As such, she reduces and separates humanity to a ­binary — men and women. She is no authority on trans people, nor on gender issues, as evidenced by the ruling of an Australian judge who said in a recent case that “she is not an expert at all. She has no recognised expertise in any of the areas in which she expresses an opinion”. Joyce tells us she knows trans people, but she has books to sell, so she has commoditised trans people’s lives. As mammies, we know that people, including trans people, cannot be reduced to numerical equations, to one or zero. Humanity is not binary. We, the mammies, know a lot of trans people, some since the day they were born. We hold their hands when they are scared, happy, ­upset, joyful. We have heard their hopes, their dreams, and dried their tears. We listen to trans people. Helen Joyce does not. We have no books to sell; just love to give. Love always wins. Jude Copeland, Bernie ­Linnane, Claire Flynn, Karen Sugrue, Mammies for Trans Rights Sir — I want to sincerely thank you for publishing your powerful and honest interview with Helen Joyce. She’s one of the few people brave enough to speak clearly and compassionately about a subject most are too afraid to touch. It is no accident that RTÉ and other media outlets refuse to interview her. They know if ­Helen is given the chance to speak plainly, their ideology cannot withstand it. They cannot ­explain why they are endorsing the sterilisation of vulnerable children in the name of identity — so instead, they silence people like Helen and smear them as unkind or extreme. But we see through it. I know I’m not alone. I’ve had countless hushed conversations with friends, neighbours and colleagues who agree with everything Helen says, but who are terrified to say so out loud. We need to be braver. The truth cannot survive if we whisper it behind closed doors. Sarah Holmes, Newcastle, Co Wicklow Sir — Your interview with ­Helen Joyce was a courageous piece that gave voice to opinions that are forbidden in most quarters of the Irish media. Dr Joyce’s remark that it is “wicked” to lie to parents by telling them their children are at increased risk of suicide if they are not “affirmed” in the belief that they were born in the wrong body deserves serious reflection. Every journalist, politician, doctor, teacher and psychotherapist must reckon with the long-term consequences of repeating claims not supported by evidence, especially when they result in irreversible damage. Truth and compassion are not mutually exclusive. Thank you for publishing an article that ­attempts to honour both. Sandra Adams, Baldoyle, Dublin 13 Sir — I read with interest the long-overdue interview with Helen Joyce. I hope this signals the end of the apparent media blackout of Irish groups like The Countess, whose founder and CEO Laoise de Brún has been campaigning on these issues since 2020. It would be refreshing to see more journalists being curious enough to cover all sides in this conversation and not continue to keep their heads in the sand. Sorcha Nic Lochlainn, director and sport ­spokeswoman, The Countess Sir — Like so many of us in ­Ireland, Helen Joyce found out that to even ask questions about gender identity can result in ­being called a bigot. The ­shaming and silencing of people asking sometimes difficult questions is ultimately harming the most vulnerable when it comes to this topic — the young people with gender dysphoria. Thank you for publishing this very important interview. Colette Colfer, Waterford city Sir — I congratulate you on publishing Sarah Caden’s careful interview with Helen Joyce. I will hold off asking “What took you so long?” as it is a question that could be asked broadly of Irish media. The cover of Joyce’s book reads Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality. Let us support children and young people to live in that reality, and look forward to the Irish media reporting on the reality of the evidence and not ideological opinion. Name with editor, Dublin 6 Sir — What a wonderful surprise to see Helen Joyce finally interviewed in a mainstream Irish newspaper. Well past time, of course. Liz Fitzpatrick, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — Following the UK Supreme Court judgment, will we finally see the same ruling apply in ­Ireland, or will minority groups use legislation already in place to demand the same rights as those of biological women? We shall wait and see. Christy Galligan, Letterkenny, Co Donegal Sir — It was great to see Northern Ireland as the subject of an editorial in the ­Sunday Independent (April 13). The question of the future of this island is very important and, in fairness to the Sunday ­Independent, it does treat the ­issue consistently. The editorial raised important issues such as whether talk of unity is a “distraction” and what might be the best way forward. It also raised the important but complex issue of reconciliation. I would be of the opinion that talk of unity can never be a distraction and that we must always be looking for a better way forward for everyone on the island. I accept there will be different views and I welcome strong debate and forthright opinion. Everyone should be challenged. I mostly find, in fact, that other people’s ideas are better than my own. However, the editorial and a column by Máiría Cahill made Leo Varadkar look like an Irish equivalent of Alexei Navalny, someone to be belittled and ­silenced. It is regrettable when an attempt is made to silence other views and to denigrate the person expressing them. None of this is to take away from the fact the Sunday Independent is to be congratulated for consistently keeping the North on the agenda. However, it should play the ball, not the man. Jim D’Arcy, Blackrock, Dundalk, Co Louth Sir — Our older citizens suffer mostly in silence with the enemy of old age — arthritis. Do our major milk companies know how hard it is to open a plastic two-litre bottle of milk now? God forbid we might throw out the containers without the now permanently attached tops. Pouring milk into a cup of tea is hard enough without having to deal with some bright spark’s invention on behalf of the nanny state. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Sir — Aspects of Sinn Féin’s past will never endear me or many of my generation to the party. Nevertheless, one has to respect its determination and appreciate its sustained role in opposition. Across the Atlantic, one of the most disturbing aspects of Donald Trump’s behaviour is the almost complete absence of any opposition to his assault on ­democracy. Whereas Republic­ans would have you believe most of the world is arriving in swooning, ass-kissing waves to the White House, the ­Democrats would be well advised to dispatch a no-nonsense, resuscitation delegation to meet Mary Lou McDonald. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Sir — I read with interest Pat O’Callaghan’s letter in the Sunday Independent of April 13. He wishes to return workers to pre-1990 annual leave entitlement. Might I recommend he read a book by John Timpson, Upside Down Management. This is a ­bible on staff relations. As someone who was a dedic­ated trade union activist for over 45 years, I could not sit in ­silence at this suggestion to erode a hard-earned entitlement. It is as outrageous as ­Finance Minister Jack Chambers announcing the increase in the minimum wage will be delayed. A minister is paid 7.6 times the minimum wage, not to mention the litany of ­allowances. I have always honoured the Starry Plough and always will. Paddy Murray, Castlepollard, Co Westmeath Sir — I read Brighid McLaughlin’s evocative account of modern Belfast (April 13) with keen interest. It brought back sharp memories of my own student days in the city during the 1970s, when it was a very ­different place indeed. Back then, you constantly had to assess your surroundings. My wife often encourages me to go up from Armagh for a day in Belfast, but I usually prefer ­Dublin. There’s still a shadow over the city in my mind, a residue of the fear we lived with. I remember dating a girl from Moy — part of what was then grimlyknown as the Murder ­Triangle — and walking her home at night, petrified by the risks. Not long ago, I met an old friend home from Calgary. We were sitting in a pub in Moy with his daughter, who grew up in Canada. I found myself saying things I hadn’t voiced in years — how, during the Troubles, we would never have sat near a pub window for fear of a car bomb or a random shooting. It shocked her, as it shocks me now. And yet I have nothing but admiration for the people of ­Belfast. Take politics out of it, and they’ll help you with anything. That same wit, warmth and fierce decency McLaughlin captured still shines through. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Sir — I am writing in response to Eilis O’Hanlon’s article (‘If you want us to watch Irish TV shows, make them better’, April 13), which takes issue with the idea of imposing levies on international streaming services to fund local productions. Is it from ignorance or wilful misinformation that Eilis chooses Dancing with the Stars and Home of the Year as the kind of programming that would be supported by this levy? Nothing could be farther from the truth. RTÉ is no friend of quality production, and the Irish film and TV industry has known this for years. The breakdown has already been worked out, with 75pc going to independent productions and a substantial portion to the Irish language. So it is more projects like Kneecap, Small Things Like These, An Cailín Ciúin, The Young Offenders and Bad Sisters that will be made. I hesitate to mention Bodkin. It is polarising, but it is at least something. Countries that have implemented such levies have witnessed significant growth in their local industries. France, for instance, requires that streaming services invest a portion of their revenues in French productions. Between 2021 and 2023, this policy led to an injec­tion of nearly €1bn into the French film and TV sector, resulting in 81 films. Netflix’s investment in Beating Hearts became Studio­Canal’s highest-grossing French release. And Netflix subscription costs in France range from €5 to €3 cheaper than in Ireland, so no additional cost to the consumer. In contrast, the UK, which has yet to adopt such levies, faces challenges in sustaining its domestic productions. The BBC anticipates airing 50 fewer hours of drama this year due to budget constraints, and Channel 4 has halved its commissioning. Unless you require global platforms to contribute fairly to the ecosystems they profit from, they simply won’t. Nothing to do with quality — it’s economics. They will only spend it in the countries that do force them to do it, to the detriment of ours. And let’s face it, the minister’s reluctance to follow through on the levies that have already been agreed has more to do with an avoidance of anything that could look like a “tariff” in the current climate. And that’s a whole other matter. Tom Hopkins, Clare Street, Dublin Sir — I believe, given my own negative health experiences, that multi-storey car parks present a serious health hazard. I have noticed that by the time I get to the shopping centre attached to the car park, I am feeling unwell and slightly dizzy. I feel nauseous nausea and have unusual heartbeats. Why is this? I believe it is caused by the carbon monoxide from the hundreds of vehicles in the car park. It is particularly bad on a dead day with little or no wind. However, even with wind, if you get enough cars you can still have a highly poisonous soup. The Government, and anyone interested in their own health, or public health, should take notice. Maurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork Sir — David Quinn rightly identifies the ludicrous demand made by the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme on the Legion of Mary to contribute over €26m to redress (Opinion, April 13). Within the first decade of its foundation, Frank Duff’s lay Catholic organisation had built the Morning Star Hostel for homeless men along with the Regina Coeli Hostel for women. The latter began to accept pregnant women and unmarried mothers in contravention of the mores of the time. Duff’s new departure to keep mothers and babies drew additional financial pressures on the Legion of Mary. Finola Kennedy in her book Frank Duff: A Life Story outlines that Duff’s vision in keeping mothers and their babies together was dependent on donations from supporters such as WT Cosgrave, Seán MacBride McBrideand Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. The architects of the redress scheme in relation to the Legion of Mary should return to the drawing board. Frank Burke, Terenure, Dublin D6W Sir — It’s ironic that the Farrelly Commission cost €13.6m and discovered nary an abuse. The saying “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” while costing the taxpayers an extortionate amount comes to mind. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir— Donald Trump telling us people have been queuing up to kiss his ass is, for me at least, proof positive that there is a donkey in the White House.

Title: 'My Mom Brings Up Every Excuse In The Book,' Says One Millennial Who Sends Her Money. Asks, 'Anyone Else Doing This Every Month?'
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/04/44889610/my-mom-brings-up-every-excuse-in-the-book-says-one-millennial-who-sends-her-money-asks-anyone-else-doing-this-every-month
Time Published: 2025-04-20T00:31:31Z
Full Content:
A post on the r/Millennials subreddit has struck a nerve with thousands of users after one woman asked, "Anyone else give your parent(s) money every month?" In the post, the original poster, who said she's a public sector lawyer in her 30s, explained that she's been sending her mother around $4,000 a year for nearly a decade. She also gave her mom a car, chipped in on another one, and gives extra cash on birthdays and holidays. Don't Miss: "I'm not a rich woman either," she wrote, adding that she paid her way through law school with student loans and paid off the debt herself. "But what really irks me," she continued, "is when I mention investments, she tells me, ‘Older people never really invested – we didn't have the same opportunities.'" That's where the conversation blew up. Many Reddit users pushed back on the mom's claim that older generations didn't have access to investing. One 67-year-old commenter wrote: "We had hella great investing opportunities in our generation. Microsoft? Amazon? Apple? Starbucks? Real Estate? Yeah." Another added, "People get mad when I point out millennials have more savings than boomers at their age, but it is actually the truth backed up by many studies. Fact is, millennials know they cannot rely on boomers for support so they save. Boomers expect everyone else to support them so they don’t." Several noted that while OP's father, who's older than her mom, invested regularly and planned ahead, her mother took out a second mortgage and racked up credit card debt instead. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Turns out, plenty of Redditors could relate. Some said they send their parents money monthly, even when it's a financial strain. Others described living with parents or covering expenses like rent, car payments, groceries and phone bills. A few mentioned they expect to support their parents for the rest of their lives, not out of wealth, but out of love and guilt. "[My mom] never held down a job, never saved anything, never invested anything, and she sells anything of value she happens to have the moment she blows through her cigarette money," one commenter wrote. "Now she lives with me because her landlord sold the property, and of course, she and her boyfriend just waited until it happened. " Others admitted they've cut off family members entirely. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Some commenters, especially those from immigrant or Latino families, pointed to cultural expectations. "I'm Latina, and our parents’ generation truly enjoys receiving money from their kids because ‘we are their retirement,’" one user said. "That messed-up way of thinking ends with me, I refuse to think of my only child as my 401(k)." Another user in the Philippines shared that he pays for house help for his parents while his siblings cover the utility bills, even though there's no formal agreement, just an obligation. But others pushed for boundaries. "If you're giving $400 a month and don't know where it's going, that's a problem," one person said. "You're not helping. You're enabling." OP clarified in the thread that her mom did help with childcare early on, but that was years ago. Since then, she's been paying full-time daycare plus her mom's stipend. "It irritates me that she brings up every excuse in the book as to why her finances are bad," she wrote. Still, there were some who said they're happy to help their parents — if only because they know no one else will. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: How To Find Massive Dividend Deals In The Tariff Panic
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/04/19/how-to-find-massive-dividend-deals-in-the-tariff-panic/
Time Published: 2025-04-19T13:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Red Tariffs newspaper headlines with assorted economy related topics On one front, this tariff pandemonium changes nothing for us: We still see our favorite high-yield investments—8%+ paying closed-end funds (CEFs)—as the best choice to anchor your retirement portfolio. In fact, times like this add to their appeal even more. That’s because, in a crash, we CEF investors don’t have to sell a single unit of our funds to get the cash we need to fund our lives. Our big dividends—many of which roll in monthly—take care of our needs for us. Then there’s CEFs’ discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). This unique-to-CEF measure tells us when a fund is cheap or pricey. And right now, thanks to the tariff panic, we’ve got a raft of discounted CEFs to choose from. And there’s one more edge we can exploit with CEFs: the fact that CEF investors are very conservative and lean heavily toward funds with long track records. This tendency to go with the tried-and-true opens up an opportunity for us. That’s because many CEF firms, like Nuveen, PIMCO and BlackRock, have CEFs of all ages in their stables. Here’s the thing, though: Whether the fund is “young” or “old,” they all tend to be run by the exact same people! So we can, in effect, buy a younger CEF and take advantage of its discount. Then we simply ride along as it ages, and its valuation nears that of its older sibling. Let’s zero in on this opportunity by looking at three CEFs from PIMCO, a California-based firm that’s long had a grip on CEF investors’ imaginations: the PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund (PTY), PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS) and PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX). PIMCO’s “brand halo” makes it difficult to buy its funds at a discount. Let’s start with PTY, far and away the oldest of our trio. Launched over 20 years ago, PTY sports an 11.2% yield that investors, well, love. It’s also by far the biggest of the three, with $2.3 billion in assets under management, compared to $910 million for PDX and $665 million for PAXS. On the other side, you have PAXS, with a 12.3% yield, and PDX, which yields 7.9%. PAXS launched at the start of 2022, and PDX is a bit older, having held its IPO in 2019. But even that 2019 date is young by CEF standards; it makes PDX the second-youngest PIMCO CEF on the market. But PTY overshadows its two younger siblings because its age lets investors analyze its long-haul payout history. And that history is very favorable indeed: PTY Dividend Here you can see that PTY’s payouts have been pretty steady over 20 years, which included the pandemic, the subprime-mortgage crisis, and the low interest rates of the 2010s. (The spikes and dips in the purple line above are special dividends.) While it’s true that the regular payouts have dipped a bit (cut 13.6% since the fund’s IPO), the average annualized yield on PTY has been 11.3% for investors who bought at the IPO date, as of this writing. To put that in perspective, someone who bought $100,000 worth of PTY has earned, on average, an income stream of $945 per month (a bit over $11,300 per year) without having to do a single thing. So, you can see why PTY has attracted a premium to NAV throughout its history. This simply means investors are willing to pay more for PTY than its portfolio is worth. It makes sense when you think about it: PTY gives investors a steady paycheck, which encourages them to stick with the fund. As a result, there are fewer shares of PTY on the market, since CEFs—unlike ETFs—tend to have a fixed share count over their lifespans. This means PTY’s market price tends to drift upward more than its NAV does. Although that’s been going up too: PTY Total Returns In total, PTY has earned an 11.7% annualized return on a NAV basis, as of this writing. That’s higher than the 11.3% average yield investors have received, so you can see how PTY has been able to maintain payouts for over two decades. To be clear, for every dollar put in PTY, over $10 in profit has been generated. When you consider that, the fund’s premium to NAV makes even more sense. And it follows that this premium would survive the tariff mayhem: PTY’s record is just too good. Now let’s shift back to the younger PAXS and PDX. They don’t have the track records to attract investors like PTY does, even though they’re managed by the same people. That’s why we have seen PAXS’s premium all but disappear amid the tariff panic, while PDX’s discount has grown wider. PIMCO Discounts This is a clear buy signal, but let me back that call up with another chart showing these funds’ dividend histories. PDX/PAXS Dividend History Now before we go further, yes, PDX’s dividend line (in orange) looks a bit wonky. There are two reasons for that: One, the fund launched just before the pandemic and, at the end of 2020, it cut its distribution by more than half. Two, PDX moved from quarterly payouts to monthly dividends in March 2024, so the dividend went from 26 cents, when the fund paid its last quarterly dividend in March 2024, to 11.3 cents a month. That masked a big raise that looks like a dip in the orange line above. PDX Dividend History In reality, PDX increased its payouts by more than 30% in early 2024. PAXS meantime, has seen one hike to its regular dividend since launch, along with a big special payout in late 2022. That “bonus” payout came as the markets were at their most fearful; thanks to PAXS’s focus on debt, it can ensure strong payouts, even when stock markets are panicking. You’d think strong income plays like these would attract buyers, despite their young ages. And they no doubt will—but not now, with the tariffs causing terror among the most conservative investors. That fear has dragged down both funds’ valuations, making both strong buys. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices, after swinging wildly along with stocks, are braced for an epic showdown between U.S. president Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has held up better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq as tariff turmoil rocks crypto and equity markets, with billionaire Ray Dalio warning of “monetary order breakdown” that could spell something worse than 2008. Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprising bitcoin price prediction, the chief executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange has said Binance is advising countries on following the U.S. in adopting bitcoin as a strategy reserve asset. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has kick started a race for countries around the world to begin adopting ... More bitcoin—something that could blow up the bitcoin price. "We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves," Richard Teng, who took over the top job at Binance after founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao was ousted when he and the company plead guilty to failing to prevent money laundering in 2023, told the Financial Times without naming the countries. Binance has also "been approached by quite a lot" of countries to "[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto," Teng added. Trump has made passing long-awaited crypto legislation a priority for his second administration, as well as signing an executive order that calls for the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile. “Compared to many other jurisdictions, [the U.S. is] way ahead on that front,” Teng said, adding it’s spurred countries into action. In March, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick predicted the bitcoin price could surge to $500,000 per bitcoin within three years due to the creation of a U.S. bitcoin and crypto reserve. Earlier this month, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan revealed CZ, who still holds a majority stake in Binance, had begun advising them on developing crypto regulations and adoption of bitcoin and crypto. “It makes sense that countries would reach out to industry players to ensure they have informed views on policy,” Anthony Pompliano, the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, said in an emailed note. “This is the game theory that bitcoiners have been talking about for decades. Once one large nation starts to acquire bitcoin, all countries are incentivized to compete to acquire bitcoin … it is not possible to ignore the United States of America—the greatest economy ever constructed in human history. If America says bitcoin is strategically important, then other countries will start seeing the asset that way as well." This month, Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential council of advisers for digital assets, said the U.S. is exploring many ways to increase its bitcoin reserve without using additional taxpayer dollars, including through tariff revenue and revaluing the government’s gold certificates. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin but remains ... More far higher than where it was before the November U.S. election. “We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there’s literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said in an interview with Pompliano. “Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it’s not happening in a silo," David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher BTC Inc, which also organizes the bitcoin conference at which Trump first proposed the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, said in a statement teasing the upcoming Las Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference. "President Trump’s establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many steps he’s taken to promote American innovation," Bailey said. In January, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. Last year, BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto said sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in bitcoin alongside wild speculation that Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund was exploring buying bitcoin.

Title: Big bets on speculative carbon capture tech ignore today’s solutions

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The first step in reducing the risks of climate change is cutting carbon emissions. The world hit a notable milestone on that front, with global energy-related emissions likely peaking last year, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Now, the world’s carbon pollution is likely to begin a long, inexorable decline over the coming decades. But there’s a catch: Emissions almost certainly won’t fall fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5 C target set in the Paris Agreement. Increasingly, hitting that target looks like it will require the world to turn to technologies that can suck carbon straight from the air in a bid to turn the global thermostat down. Investors have spent years laying the groundwork to develop a sector that has the potential to undergird carbon markets that BNEF estimates could reach $1.1 trillion in the coming decades. Companies from Occidental Petroleum to Microsoft along with firms like BlackRock and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures are among the investors throwing billions at startups. The U.S. government has been a significant patron, with the Energy Department committing more than $1 billion to get carbon removal off the ground. But funding and buyers of carbon removal services have so far targeted a narrow subset of techniques to clean the atmosphere. And U.S. federal support is now up in the air as the Donald Trump administration pursues funding cuts to all manner of climate programs. This is happening in what is shaping up to be a formative period for the carbon removal industry as companies attempt the perilous journey from pilot projects to commercialization, said Robert Hoglund, co-founder of carbon removal clearinghouse CDR.fyi. To ensure the industry has a fighting chance to reach the scale needed, it will need an enormous financial boost. "If we don’t get new buyers, we’re stuck in the seed stage,” he said. There are at least eight broad categories for removing carbon to clean up the atmosphere, with more than 900 startups trying different approaches. The money that's been rushing into the carbon chase has overwhelmingly backed a technique known as direct air capture (DAC), which involves using machines to suck up carbon. Firms are placing major bets on it even though the technology remains unproven at scale, inordinately expensive and energy intensive. Far less investor money is flowing to competing methods such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean and using crushed rocks, a process known as enhanced weathering. Between 2020 to 2024, firms have bet $3.3 billion on DAC compared to $3.4 billion for all other novel approaches, according to publicly available data compiled by CDR.fyi. The technology receives a disproportionate amount of private investment because it’s backed by U.S. federal tax credits and grants, according to Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. That support isn’t because the government decided DAC is the best way to remove carbon, he said, but "because the political economy of the oil and gas industry is much more powerful than these other emerging industries.” Carbon removal buyers looking to meet their climate targets have also not diversified their portfolios. Almost 60% of all purchases tracked by CDR.fyi between 2019 and 2024 are for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It involves burning wood to run power plants, then capturing and sequestering the resulting emissions underground. Hence, the CO2 the trees and plants pull from the atmosphere during their lifetimes stays put. Despite the interest, research has found that cutting down and transporting feedstock can emit more carbon than it sequesters, making carbon accounting a big challenge. BECCS made up about 85% of Microsoft’s 8.2 million metric ton portfolio for novel carbon removal through 2024 tracked by CDR.fyi. The technique "offers attractive costs with an achievable scale inside the 2030 timeline,” said Brian Marrs, the company’s senior director of energy and carbon removal. Bioenergy plants already exist, and retrofitting them for carbon capture is arguably faster than building and scaling novel carbon removal technology. Since 2024, Microsoft has only added to its BECCS portfolio, signing a landmark 6.75 million ton deal with Houston-based developer Fidelis New Energy earlier this month to purchase removal from a plant being built near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It’s the largest deal for novel carbon removal to date. The company also recently added another 3.7 million ton purchase from CO280 Solutions, which captures CO2 from pulp and paper mills, reflecting Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its climate commitments. Microsoft takes a "portfolio approach” to procuring carbon removal, balancing costs, deployment timelines and scale potential for different methods, Marrs said, adding that the company also purchases nature-based carbon credits in addition to engineered removals. BECCS’s dominance is not to say DAC or other technologies haven’t seen big purchases. According to CDR.fyi, Oxy subsidiary 1PointFive has sold 1.3 million tons of carbon removal services to companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Airbus, making it the largest DAC purveyor. Its next-closest competitors, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, have each sold a bit more than a quarter of that amount. Yet these approaches have yet to live up to their promise. Through 2024, DAC delivered around 1,200 tons of CO2 removal — less than 0.2% of all carbon removed over that time frame — and BECCS has delivered 10,000 tons — less than 1.7% of the total — per CDR.fyi. Just a handful of companies are buying the bulk of carbon removal credits. Microsoft alone is responsible for the majority of carbon removal purchases to date, though Alphabet’s Google and Stripe are also among major buyers. That’s because durable removal isn’t cheap. Using DAC can cost upwards of $1,000 per ton of CO2. Compare that to standard forest carbon credits, which are often sold for under $10. "The only way to make this scale is to make it mandatory,” said Wim Carton, an associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden. Carbon removal is a public good governments should treat as akin to a "trash removal service,” said Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global public policy and external affairs. That approach should also include sticks, he added, much like littering results in a fine. But with Trump — who has called former President Joe Biden’s climate legislation "the green new scam” — the odds of the U.S. doubling down on climate regulation are low. What climate scientists want investors and entrepreneurs to understand is that carbon removal has a narrow set of appropriate use cases. The first is cleaning up legacy emissions. Decades of humanity’s CO2 is lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. If the Earth were an overflowing bathtub, turning the faucet off — cutting emissions — wouldn’t be enough to stop the water from spilling over. You also need to open the drain. The second use is for the unavoidable, steady drip of CO2 for decades from sectors like agriculture and aviation. All other applications of carbon clean-up technologies could do more harm than good since they risk slowing down emissions cuts today by promising removals down the road, Carton said. That’s especially true for using captured CO2 to extract more fossil fuels, a practice that climate researchers agree needs to be rapidly wound down. Exactly how much carbon the world needs to remove from the atmosphere depends on how quickly that happens. In a scenario where humanity dramatically curbs emissions, scientists estimate that 4.8 billion tons of CO2 removal will be needed annually by mid-century to keep the climate stable with all of it coming from conventional methods like planting trees. In what’s an increasingly likely scenario of continuing to burn fossil fuels, the planet will require almost 9.8 billion tons annually to compensate for the added emissions with 3.5 billion of that from novel techniques like DAC. The world is nowhere near that. Through 2024, about 13 million tons of carbon removal credits have been sold since CDR.fyi began tracking the market for novel carbon removal, what Cullenward called "a rounding error.” The clock is ticking on scaling that up. "We’re far too late, and we’ve eaten up too much of the carbon budget to say that we don’t need it,” said Sabine Fuss, co-chair of the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. While DAC and BECCS are attracting the most investment and purchases respectively, they’re crowding out other promising carbon removal technologies. Some startups use clever engineering to accelerate natural processes, like increasing the ocean’s alkalinity. Others are electrolyzing seawater and spreading crushed basalt rock over farmland. These methods promise greater durability, verifiability and effectiveness of storing CO2 than simply planting trees. Another method has provided the majority of all carbon removal delivered: biochar. It’s done so without the support of U.S. tax credits, large purchases from brand-name buyers or billions in investments. In some ways, biochar is the "unrecognized star” of carbon removal, said Carton. Compared to other methods, it’s cheap and doesn’t require much upfront capital expenditure or high-tech research and development. Making it requires kilns to heat biomass, and the resulting charcoal-like product can also be used to help improve soil fertility. But like all carbon removal techniques, there are downsides, the biggest being uncertainty about how much CO2 stays sequestered when it’s added to different soils. That’s an area of active investigation for researchers. "It’s got so much potential, but it’s inconclusive,” said Ben Kolosz, an assistant professor in renewable energy and carbon removal at the University of Hull in the U.K. Still other methods like ocean alkalinity enhancement and enhanced rock weathering hold even greater promise to capture and store vast amounts of CO2. But they are not as "approachable” or "intuitive” as technologies like DAC, which may give investors and would-be buyers pause, said Anu Khan, founder and executive director of the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative. CDR.fyi’s Hoglund compared the carbon removal industry’s efforts to the pharmaceutical industry's pursuit of new drugs. "You need huge upfront investments for it to work,” said Hoglund, who is also the manager of the Milkywire Climate Transformation Fund, an organization that supports carbon removal, decarbonization and nature-based projects. That ultimately means securing committed buyers with deep pockets. "We need many Microsofts to start scaling this,” he said.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.

More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Title: St Mary’s seek to continue storming season by toppling Cork Con

The stakes ratchet up in the All-Ireland League on Saturday as the competition shifts from 18 rounds and eight months of league action to the playoffs in all five divisions. In Division 1A only six points separated the top four and there’s little in the way of a form guide judging by previous clashes. St Mary’s College v Cork Constitution, Templeville Road, live on irishrugby+: Promoted St Mary’s have taken the division by storm (witness 13 try-scoring bonus points in 18 games) to earn a home semi-final against the champions. A single point separated them in the table and ditto in their two meetings; a 27-27 draw at Temple Hill in November and Con’s 30-29 win at Templeville Road in January. St Mary’s fielded a weakened side in Clontarf a fortnight ago but Mark McHugh is expected to recall key man Conor Dean at outhalf and summer signings Greg Jones and Dan Goggin. Con make two changes from their 47-45 win over Terenure. Veteran centre Niall Kenneally is restored and, with Mark Donnelly on Munster duty, David Good starts at loosehead. They are seeking to become the first club to retain the AIL title since Shannon in 2006. Clontarf v Lansdowne, Castle Avenue (4pm) Live on irishrugby+: Emulating Clontarf’s astonishing 49-46 win at the same venue in January will be nigh impossible, as a 12-try rollercoaster was won by Conor Kelly’s penalty with the last kick. Clontarf are seeking to regain the title they won in 2022 before losing in the final a year later, and with a largely rebuilt side. They tend to be clinical after gaining access to the opposition’s 22, and that January extravaganza was one of five games that they have won with the last play. They make just one change to the side that sealed a home semi-final by beating St Mary’s a fortnight ago, with Stephen Ryan starting on the left-wing and two players added to their bench as sides are allowed 23-man squads in the knock-out stages. By contrast, Lansdowne rested most of their frontliners for the win over Garryowen a fortnight ago. Hence, Declan Fassbender recalls 11 players, with Charlie Tector starting at inside centre. Lansdowne, who beat ‘Tarf 26-17 at home back in November, have won eight of their last nine matches as they aim for their first final since 2018. The weather may possibly be more to Clontarf’s liking. City of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Nenagh Ormond v Blackrock College, New Ormond Park: City of Armagh surprisingly slipped into ninth in 1A, whereas UCC climbed into fourth in 1B, on the last day. The students include four recent or current Ireland under-20/Munster academy players in Ben O’Connor, Gene O’Leary Kareem, Seán Odogbu and Michael Foy. Although Nenagh Ormond finished six points above Blackrock, their two wins over them were tight – 38-36 away in September and 21-17 at home three weeks ago. James Blaney is seeking yet another promotion with ‘Rock, who are missing injured Ireland under-20 scrumhalf Oliver Coffey. Cashel v MU Barnhall, Spafield (2.30pm); Dublin University v Greystones, College Park (2.30pm): Cashel and Barnhall also met in last season’s playoffs, the latter winning by two points in Spafield before losing to Queen’s in the playoff final. Barnhall finished second, one point above Cashel, thanks in part to a 30-17 home win over the Tipperary club in January and two bonus points from a 36-33 loss in the February reverse fixture. Trinity are trying to avoid successive relegations and will be favourites at home to Greytones, who finished fourth in 2A. Cashel finished just one point above Barnhall. Dungannon v Clogher Valley, Stevenson Park (2.30pm); Navan v Galwegians, Old Balreask (2.30pm): Navan finished ninth in 2A in their centenary season, and will host Galwegians, who had theirs a year previously, after the Galway club squeezed into fourth in 2B at the end of a fairly luckless campaign in which eight of their nine losses were by a score. Forwards coach Jarrad Butler starts for them, with this season’s Ireland under-20 captain Éanna McCarthy a replacement. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in an Ulster derby after finishing 16 points above them. Midleton v Dolphin, Towns Park (2.30pm); Skerries v Ballyclare, Holmpatrick (2.30pm): Midleton host Dolphin after finishing three pints above their Cork rivals courtesy in part to a 15-all draw away and an 18-13 win in Towns Park. Skerries have to reset their sights on the playoffs after slipping into ninth on the final day by points difference while Ballyclare are in bonus territory at the end of their first AIL season.

Title: XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight

Time Published: 2025-04-19T02:00:10Z

With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge. According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. In a recent podcast, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP. The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs. The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments. More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Canary Capital on Friday filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The staking feature of the Canary Staked TRX ETF would allow investors to earn extra yield with their investment. The fund’s “investment objective is to seek to provide exposure to the price of Tron,” the filing said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary has filed for a number of crypto ETFs. The fledgling crypto-focused asset manager is hoping Wall Street’s biggest regulator will give the green light to Sui, Pudgy Penguins, and XRP funds. Those applications are part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, a result of last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have garnered more than $35 billion in net inflows over a 15-month period. The prospectus, also called a registration statement, did not say on which exchange the proposed fund would trade. Staking, the process of pledging proof-of-stake assets to a network to help it function in exchange for rewards, has been a controversial issue in regulators’ consideration of crypto ETFs. Proponents maintain that staking will lead to wider institutional adoption of crypto products, but critics view it as an unnecessary risk for investors. The SEC has yet to approve a staking feature in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator delayed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum. Tron, which trades as TRX and is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was recently trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain, and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares and VanEck are among the long list of major fund issuers currently seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs tracking different digital assets. Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs are the most likely to receive approval next.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. READ MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy? “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America.

Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled.

Title: Coinbase and traditional financial firms poised to benefit from US stablecoin legislation

Firms such as PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard could have direct benefits, while Charles Schwab and BlackRock could gain indirectly. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report. The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards. Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange’s model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins. Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation. The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities. Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions. Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers. Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line. Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area. The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers. In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone. The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets. The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC. As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

By BERNARD CONDON, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Friday, April 18th, 2025 As the Western hemisphere wound down trading activity with the onset of the Easter holidays, crude oil markets have posted an impressive 7% week-on-week rise, with ICE Brent now back at $68 per barrel. New OPEC+ compensation quotas, tighter US sanctions on Iran, and relatively upbeat March macro data have all boosted sentiment in the short term, although further US-China escalation could upend this week’s recovery. US Ratchets Up Pressure on Iran. The Trump Administration issued new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports, including the Shengxing Chemical teapot refinery based in Shandong province for purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, the second Chinese refiner to be hit with direct sanctions. EIA Is Bleeding People After DOGE Check. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is reported to have lost more than 100 employees in the latest round of resignation offers put forward by Elon Musk’s DOGE drive, possibly losing up to 40% of the EIA’s 350 employees, putting data publications at risk. Mauritania Exports Its First Ever Gas Cargo. UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) has finally loaded its first LNG shipment - aboard the British Sponsor LNG carrier - from the 2.3 mtpa Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) facility offshore Mauritania, following a six-week delay to the export terminal’s commissioning. Equinor’s US Wind Ambitions Dissipate. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated a halt to construction of the Empire Wind offshore project developed by Norway’s state oil firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) off the New York Coast, citing insufficient environmental analysis before approval. BlackRock Gets Ready to Buy Up Utilities. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to own major stakes of public utility companies, a joint 2023 motion of 16 Republican-led states decrying its ESG investing demands on utility companies. Bahrain Resumes LNG Imports. Despite being a producer of oil and sharing a huge oil field with Saudi Arabia, the Middle Eastern kingdom of Bahrain is set to resume importing LNG after a five-year hiatus, with a 170,000 m3 cargo from the US Sabine Pass LNG facility moving towards the Arab Gulf. Europe Has Now Only Two Russian Buyers. The Czech Republic has officially halted its imports of Russian crude after the Transalpine pipeline (TAL) from Italy’s Trieste boosted throughput capacity to 900,000 b/d, with Czech refiners now getting all of their oil needs from the seas. Congo Taps Blackwater Know-How. Erik Prince, the founder of private military firm Blackwater, has allegedly signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure the country’s vast metal reserves and reduce cross-border smuggling of commodities amidst ongoing warfare in Eastern Congo. Trading Firms Eye Italian Refinery Sale. Global commodity traders Glencore (LON:GLEN) and Gunvor are considering buying Italy’s API downstream firm, operating two refineries in Ancona and Trecate, totalling 200,000 b/d in capacity, with Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR also keen to purchase the asset. Force Majeure Saps Malaysia’s LNG Supply. Malaysia’s Petronas, operator of the giant 29.3 mtpa Bintulu LNG export terminal, is experiencing production issues due to boiler malfunction, setting a pricing floor for Asia’s JKM gas futures that are set to rebound from their 9-month low of $12 per mmBtu. China Hits New Coal Record. China posted another all-time high in coal production as the March supply totals amounted to 440.6 million tonnes, up 9.6% from a year ago, worsening the country’s coal oversupply and forcing power utilities to cut their coal imports by 6% month-over-month in March. Refiners Flee California Regulatory Hell. US refining giant Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) filed its request to ‘idle, restructure or cease’ operations at its 170,000 b/d Benicia refinery next to San Francisco by April 2026, marking the second refinery closure in California in less than a year amidst rising regulatory costs. America’s Copper Dream Is On. Following years of stalling and controversy, the Trump administration is set to approve a land swap that would pave the way for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and its project partner BHP (NYSE:BHP) to launch one of the world’s largest copper mines, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona. Ukraine Signs Watered-Down Minerals Deal. Ukrainian authorities stated that Kyiv and Washington have signed a memorandum of intent on developing mineral resources in the Eastern European country, aiming for the establishment of a Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with a full deal expected next week.

The funds raised will be for its airports business, specifically for the upcoming airport at Navi Mumbai, the first phase of which is scheduled to commence operations in June this year, according to indications given by its airport arm. Sources said that the group was confident that a public issuance of bonds would get strong traction from US investors, a view bolstered by a recent $750 million private bond placement by an Adani group offshore promoter entity that was subscribed by leading investors including the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock. In February, the group had raised $200 million through a private bond placement for its port operations in Australia. The group is now looking for a larger fund raise through a public bond issue, and the indications are that it could be some time in the middle of the year. In February, US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order directing the US Department of Justice to stop prosecuting Americans who had been accused of bribing foreign officials to secure business contracts. More recently the Trump administration indicated it was rolling back enforcement of certain kinds of white-collar crimes including bribery charges. These developments have been seen as benefiting the Adani group, which is facing bribery and securities fraud charges there. Last year group founder Gautam Adani and several other executives were charged by US law enforcement bodies with bribing officials in India to get solar power contracts for Adani Green Energy, which at that time was raising funds in the US. Any public issuance targeting US investors would require registering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also probing the group over the alleged securities fraud. The Navi Mumbai International Airport, in which the Adani group has a 74 per cent stake, will commence operations with one terminal handling 20 million passengers annually. It will be ramped up in phases to reach a passenger-handling capacity of 90 million. Published on April 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: The dollar's sell-off raises concerns that investors are losing trust in the U.S.

Watch CBS News April 18, 2025 / 10:22 AM EDT / CBS/AP Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years — a drop that raises concerns investors may be losing confidence in the U.S. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects deeper investment concerns as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. "Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye." The sell-off in the dollar has accompanied turmoil in both the U.S. stock and bond markets, with investors selling off shares and Treasuries amid concerns about the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on corporate growth and investment. The S&P 500 remains 14% lower than its most recent peak in February, placing it in correction territory. "Particularly disturbing is that both U.S. stocks and bonds fall during these periods—a phenomenon common in emerging markets but rare in developed markets and almost never in America," said Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst. "This is an unambiguous signal from traders that trade wars are sharply curtailing the 'exorbitant privilege' the U.S. has enjoyed for the past half-century." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. To be sure, many investors don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. Some experts say the dollar's decline may be due to its overvaluation, rather than any underlying changes in the strength of the U.S. The dollar "has been overvalued for too long," said Eurizon SLJ Capital in a research note. "All over Europe, we have for years been seeing a tsunami of American tourists, because it was cheaper for an American to fly to Europe to ski than to an American resort 2 hours from home ... A correction in the dollar is just and healthy." But even that is concerning enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that "exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a "confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, "It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar's reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. "Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with," says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. "At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. " They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, "If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin." Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren't as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. "The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn't an alternative." Maybe so, but Mr. Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the way he's rolled them out, with numerous halts and delays. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money, experts say. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is "ripping off" America, as Mr. Trump puts it. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Mr. Trump blasted him, saying "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Strange Sell-Off In The Dollar Raises The Specter Of Investors Losing Trust In The US Under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival.

It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Title: BlackRockâs Panama port deal stirs debate over Chinese chokehold on strategic shipping routes

Trump warns of strategic risks as BlackRock seeks $22B Panama Canal ports deal. Panama Canalâs US-built legacy at stake amid Chinaâs opposition to the acquisition.

Military experts highlight Panamaâs vulnerability to port blockades disrupting global trade. US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. President Donald Trump's recent congressional address has thrust the Panama Canal into the spotlight of a new geopolitical contest. Trump highlighted BlackRock's proposed $22 billion acquisition of ports at either end of the Panama Canalâcurrently owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchisonâcalling attention to the strategic risks of foreign control over vital infrastructure. The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

Posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt Nikita Casap sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, discussing relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. The Wisconsin teen accused of killing his parents to obtain financial means to assassinate President Trump and overthrow the United States government was allegedly working with foreign entities, including someone with a Ukrainian phone number and someone in Russia, according to an FBI affidavit. He also asked his contact who would be blamed for the attack, and was told "Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal." Nikita Casap, 17, of Wisconsin, allegedly sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, who writes in Cyrillic, discussing going into "hiding" before relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison. Additionally, to avoid detection, the instructions advise to not bring a cell phone." In a Telegram chat from January 21, 2025, it was revealed that the goal of the operation was to blame Russia for the assasination. ...more TOPICS: KEYWORDS: assassinationplot; heroofzeeperland; nikitacasap; trump; ukraine; zeeperhero Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-34 next last 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: bitt Wow, what a genius. 2 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:31 PM PDT by yldstrk (Nothing like the truth) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: bitt What was his Reddit/Bluesky handle? 3 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:44 PM PDT by RushIsMyTeddyBear ("Uncle Sugar" is being audited and having an enema.)

It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison.

Realty firm Prestige Estates Projects Ltd sales bookings rose 48 per cent to nearly Rs 7,000 crore in January-March quarter, but pre-sales declined 19 per cent to over Rs 17,000 crore in the last fiscal. Prestige Estates attributed the fall in annual sales bookings numbers to lower launches of housing projects due to a lack of approvals from development authorities. As a result, the company has failed to achieve the annual sales bookings guidance of Rs 24,000 crore. In a regulatory filing, Bengaluru-based Prestige Estates shared its operational performance for the fourth quarter of the last fiscal and the full 2024-25 financial year. The company’s sales bookings stood at Rs 6,957.4 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal, an increase of 48 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y).

For plotted developments, the average realisation rose to Rs 6,975 per square feet, a 27 per cent increase from the same quarter last year. Prestige Estates said the sales bookings during the 2024-25 fiscal declined 19 per cent to Rs 17,023.1 crore, “reflecting the impact of deferred launches amid approval delays”. Sales volume for 2024-25 stood at 12.58 million square feet, down 38 per cent Y-o-Y. Total units sold across FY25 stood at 5,919. The average realisation for apartments, villas, and commercial products rose to Rs 14,113 per square feet, an impressive 36 per cent increase Y-o-Y. Plot sale realisation increased to Rs 7,167 per square foot, registering a 50 per cent Y-o-Y growth. Irfan Razack, Chairman and Managing Director of Prestige Group, said, “FY25 brought with it a mix of achievements and challenges. Despite delays in project approvals that deferred a few key launches into the next fiscal, the final quarter saw strong traction in sales and an encouraging uptick in realisations. “ The appetite for quality real estate remains robust, as evidenced by the outstanding response to the company’s recent launches, he added. “Our focus on customer-centric offerings and premium positioning has also translated into meaningful growth in per square foot realisations. FY26 is set to be a defining year for Prestige Group as we expand into newer markets, launching marquee projects in NCR and Mumbai and achieving our maiden residential completions in Mumbai,” Razack said. “With approvals progressing and the demand environment holding steady, we are optimistic about scaling new heights in the coming year and deepening our presence across key geographies,” Razack said.

As part of the deal, Tata Elxsi will establish a dedicated global engineering centre focused on SDV platforms, electrification, body and chassis, and cloud-native development.

Read more With FY25 constant currency (CC) revenue growth at 4.2 per cent, which follows a very weak FY24 in which the CC revenue growth was at just 1.4 per cent, Infosys is staring back at its weakest two-year performance in almost the last 25 years. However, this is not the end of the slowdown, with the company guiding for FY26 CC revenue growth of 0-3 per cent, with the upper end of 3 per cent based on optimistic management assumptions that there will be steady to marginally improving business environment. That could be a hard ask, given the global tariff-war driven uncertainties and the US recession probability having increased in recent weeks. Even assuming the company is able to achieve the mid-point of the range of 1.5 per cent, its three-year CC revenue CAGR will be 2.3 per cent.

Mumbai: Ahmedabad-headquartered Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said Thursday that it will buy a port terminal in Australia’s Queensland from a promoter company in a non-cash deal that values the 50-million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) capacity asset at an enterprise value of A$3,975 million (approximately ₹21,640 crore or $2.5 billion). The Adanis’ flagship port company will issue 143.8 million equity shares to Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (CRPSHPL). CRPSHPL is a promoter-owned entity that ultimately owns the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT). The transaction will see promoter shareholding in APSEZ go up by 2.13 percentage points to 68.02%. APSEZ had first purchased the port terminal in 2011 for about ₹9,000 crore, as per news reports. However, the asset was sold to the Adani family in 2013 to manage the debt of the listed company. Also read | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds “NQXT’s acquisition is a pivotal step in our international strategy, opening new export markets and securing long-term contracts with valued users,” Ashwani Gupta, whole-time director & CEO, APSEZ, said in a press statement. The terminal is strategically located on the East-West trade corridor, he said. The company is aiming to grow the Ebitda from the asset to A$400 million (about $255 million) in four years, Gupta further said. It recorded an Ebitda of A$ 228 million in FY25. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The terminal has a rated capacity of 50 MTPA and the company estimates that the capacity can be ramped up to 120 MTPA as demand grows. In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the terminal handled 35 million metric tonnes of cargo, the company said. As part of the transaction, APSEZ will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities associated with the terminal. However, APSEZ’s leverage will remain at similar levels post the transaction, the company said. Read this | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever NQXT is a natural deep-water, multi-user export terminal at the Port of Abbot Point, approximately 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government till the year 2110. The terminal has a “high quality customer base” operating in the Bowen and Galilee mining basins. These mining companies export metallurgical and energy coal to over 15 countries from NQXT. APSEZ is India’s largest commercial ports operator, and accounts for almost one-fourth of the cargo movement in the country. The expansion is part of APSEZ’s stated goal of handling 1 billion tonnes per annum capacity by 2030. It handled 450 million tonnes in FY25, as per an investor presentation. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹26,711 crore in FY24, and net profit of ₹8,104 crore, per data from the BSE. The company's shares closed 2.2% higher at ₹1,259.90 on the BSE on Thursday.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump
URL: https://www.clickondetroit.com/business/2025/04/17/strange-sell-off-in-the-dollar-raises-the-specter-of-investors-losing-trust-in-the-us-under-trump/

Bernard Condon Associated Press Published: April 17, 2025 at 7:25 PM Updated: April 18, 2025 at 3:26 PM Bernard Condon Associated Press NEW YORK – Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. Recommended Videos The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost."

Title: All Yellow - Frank McNally on singing Emily Dickinson, Joyce’s advanced maths, and quantum mechanics in Blackrock

The fact had somehow escaped me until an email responding to Wednesday’s column about Emily Dickinson. And I’m not sure if I wasn’t better off without the information. But as I now know, for good or bad, most if not all of Dickinson’s poems can be sung to the tune of a traditional American ballad, The Yellow Rose of Texas. For this, I’m indebted to reader Seán Lyons, who tells me he first learned it from a lecture by an American professor at Listowel Writers’ Week a few years back. A long-time admirer of Dickinson, Lyons now sees her in a completely different light: “I cannot read her poems since without mentally donning a 10-gallon hat, and heading towards the sunset, just my rifle, my pony, and me.” Sure enough, I too have suddenly taken to humming “Hope is the thing with feathers–/That perches in the soul”, in a jaunty, thigh-slapping, hoedown rhythm. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,/And Mourners to and fro” has also acquired a whole new personality. But it’s not just The Yellow Rose of Texas, apparently. There are many other songs you can sing Dickinson’s poems to just as well. That’s in part because she wrote in ballad (or hymnal) meter. It may also be an effect of her famous dashes, which break up the lines in a way that Ronnie Drew might have done, to pause for beneath. Whatever the reason, it makes my image of her sharing a bench on the Royal Canal with Brendan Behan seem even more plausible. I don’t know if The Yellow Rose of Texas was one of Behan’s party pieces, but in his memoir Hold Your Hour and Have Another, he mentions someone else singing it in his presence during a pub session in Co Down once. Yellow was not an apt colour that day. It was the Twelfth of July, in the overwhelmingly unionist village of Millisle. Despite being a red-roaring republican, the mischievous Behan was disappointed the old man singing did not choose “something more Orange”. Discussing Euler’s Identity, “the most beautiful equation in maths”, in Thursday’s Irish Times, Peter Lynch was nevertheless mystified as to why a recent visitor to the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove wrote the formula into the visitors’ book. I don’t know either, but perhaps the tower’s circularity inspired thoughts of Pi, one of the numbers used in the equation? Or maybe the visitor was responding to what he saw as the beauty of Joyce’s maths, especially in the construction of Finnegans Wake. I’m thinking of a study by physicists in Poland some years ago, which analysed sentence-length and other patterns in 100 works of literature. FW was the standout result. The study found that its structures mimicked “purely mathematical multifractals”. By his own estimation at the time he was writing it, Joyce was attempting to square the circle. “I am making an engine with only one wheel,” he told his benefactor Harriet Weaver. “No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I’m driving at, don’t you? […] It’s a wheel ... And it’s all square.” Joyce was of course born in a square, in 1882. But even then, there were complications. The square – Brighton Square in Rathgar – was and remains, notoriously, a triangle. The same Martello tower was the venue on Wednesday for the announcement of a new, marathon Bloomsday event, the first instalment of which will take place on June 14th. No, it’s not a mere reading marathon: there are plenty of those already. This will involve athletic activity, the more enthusiastic participants in which will cover 100km. The goal is to run from Sandycove to Mullingar, a town in which the young Joyce spent a formative summer and which also features in Ulysses. Hardline athletes will leave the Martello tower at 6am on the Saturday in question. But the event is not a race, organisers insist. Nor are most of those taking part are not expected to make the full trek. Other suggested starting points include Maynooth, Enfield and Kinnegad. Even 5km sections of the route are encouraged. The main thing is to get to Mullingar around 5pm, for further fun. The Joycean connection aside, half the point is to celebrate the aforementioned Royal Canal and its Greenway. Hence the “Royal Canal Odyssey”, to give the event its full name. More details are at royalcanalodyssey.ie Getting back to advanced maths, I was briefly alarmed by the subheading on our restaurant review yesterday: “Tucked away above a main street bar, Blackrock gets its Barcelona moment.” The thought of Blackrock being tucked away in the upstairs room of a pub somewhere suggested an experiment by Flann O’Brien’s mad scientist De Selby gone wrong. He was last seen running amok in a neighbouring suburb (The Dalkey Archive, 1964). But his creator was a regular in at least one Blackrock pub, so De Selby could well have been implicated here too. Happily, as the story revealed, Blackrock has not turned into a black hole. It’s only a new restaurant that is tucked away over a bar, not that the entire suburb has collapsed in on itself. This must have been a great relief to all concerned. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Activism OffGuardian Our successor to This Week in the Guardian, This Week in the New Normal is our weekly chart of the progress of autocracy, authoritarianism and economic restructuring around the world. Klaus Schwab, founder and leader of the World Economic Forum, is “beginning the process” of stepping down from his duties as chairman of the board of trustees. This “process” is apparently going to take until at least January 2027, so right there you have to wonder how real any of this is at all. But there is precedent, as this announcement follows on from his resignation as Chief Executive in 2023, a role he was succeeded in by Norwegian politician Børge Brende. Now, while an 87 year old man (allegedly) retiring is not, of itself, newsworthy it does raise interesting questions. Such as “why now?” and “who is replacing him?” As to the former, I would guess it’s because Klaus is now tainted. He is too publicly associated with Covid and the “Great Reset”. His presence immediately turns people off, his ideas are instantly suspected. It’s the same reason you don’t see Bill Gates giving as many interviews as you did during Covid. These are the faces of the New Normal agenda, and as that agenda becomes more covert than overt the people who proudly nailed their colours to its mast need to be pushed aside so the greater work can continue. That’s not to say they are being actually rejected or their ideas repudiated, of course, just that their public association is damaging. In the latter case, one early rumor suggested Tony Blair would be taking the job, but (if my reasoning can be trusted) that was never likely. Replacing Schwab with Blair to reduce bad press is like replacing your toaster with a flamethrower so you don’t burn your muffins. Other potential replacements include the other members of the board – Christine Lagarde of the ECB, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. But they largely have the same issue as Blair – namely, they are creepy and everyone hates them. I would suspect that a good portion of the next 18 months of “stepping down process” will be spent holding auditions for some bland-faced Trudeau-like “nice guy” type who can say all the same things Uncle Klaus used to say, without looking and sounding like a Bond villain. Tariffs and Trump and trade are taking up the headlines right now, with online censorship and Adolescence rushing to fill any gaps. Behind that, the now-familiar strains of music still play on a loop. Digital currency this, Covid that and – among other things – Bird Flu. Mexico’s Health Ministry recorded its first official human case of Bird Flu this week, according to Reuters In India, it’s being reported that a two-year-old child died of bird flu after eating raw chicken. The details are unclear, but on the face of it that story makes no sense. In England, DEFRA have ordered stricter measures be put in place in the north after more cases of H5N1 were allegedly found in wild birds. The Conversation warns that bird flu “could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans”. There’s some background noise building. Just in time for an Easter – or post-Easter – scare maybe? I’m not a monster, screams the headline, but I regret having children: And you know what, fine. Maybe regretting having children doesn’t make you a monster, but writing an article about it that your children will likely one day see, does. But that’s just taking the story at face value. The author is anonymous, the names apparently made up, so maybe the whole thing is just a piece of propaganda attacking the idea of having a family. We’re all more than used to the “free speech is hurting our kids!” argument; there’s always someone somewhere mewling out some variation. This week that someone is Ian Russell, an “online safety campaigner”, and the somewhere is BBC Newsnight: "We cannot keep waiting for change to come." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, says there is a "rising anger" amongst bereaved families and calls for Ofcom to be "less timid".#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/W0B9jgrG6j My favourite bit is the part where he says that OfCom need to be “less timid” about enforcing an act…that only came into force 3 weeks ago. I also like how vague the term “real change” is. Just a little tip: When pundits get vague it’s for one of two reasons. Either they don’t know what they’re talking about, or they know the specifics will make them sound stupid. I’m guessing, in this instance, it’s the second one. All told a pretty hectic week for the new normal crowd, and we didn’t even mention the Colorado Bill that classify misgendering your child as “child abuse” or San Francisco’s “equity-based” speeding tickets, which charge you more (or less) depending on your income.

Title: FDA Approves Neuralink Rival’s Brain Implant

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026.

Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

By Paige Gross, Stateline.org The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two. It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today. “Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.” As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information. For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say. “We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.” As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai. To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade. As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year. “And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.” The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively. Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing. Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said. “If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.” Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027. As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges. The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported. Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE. Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills. Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community. “The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said. Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers. But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand. “The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said. The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found. Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said. “The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.” Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January. The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said. “I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.” For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit. Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example. With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high. “We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?” Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center. Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed” large data centers. Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices. “It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’” ©2025 States Newsroom.
