Second question: does the “supposed” Cartel de los Soles actually exist? Before we get to the meat of this article, which is really two articles in one, a quick recap (just in case some readers have been on a news-fast for the past three weeks). A few months ago, the US government designated the “SUPPOSED” (more on that later) “Cartel de los Soles” as a terrorist organisation, of which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is its alleged leader — alleged as in according to the US government. In early August, the Trump Administration offered a $50 million reward, up from $25 million, for information leading to the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, accusing Venezuela of being a “narco state.” Shortly thereafter, the US announced the deployment of a missile cruiser, a submarine, and three amphibious ships carrying 4,500 troops to the Caribbean, under the pretext of intercepting drug trafficking networks. There is no open talk of regime change though that is clearly the goal, as we noted in our post last Friday on the real reasons behind Washington’s latest show of force against Venezuela: Anyone who believes or supports this latest pretext for war against a country the US has tried to regime change at least twice so far this century and which has been subject to more than a decade of crippling US sanctions is either exceptionally gullible or an apologist for empire. The most important reason, of course, is oil. As the Mexican-Lebanese geopolitical analyst Alfredo Jalife says, Venezuela, once the “ranchito” of the Rockefeller family, is written with a capital “P” for “petroleo”. Indeed, even as Trump has ratcheted tensions with Venezuela, Chevron is still pumping out Venezuelan oil and shipping it back to the US. Other possible reasons include Venezuela’s close ties to China, Russia and Iran, the US’ three most important strategic rivals. As we noted in that post, the build-up of troops could also be part of a diversionary tactic as the Trump administration continues to reel from the Epstein scandal. This being Trump, it could also be just pure bluff or bluster. But it could also be the beginnings of something far more serious: another US-led military disaster. In recent days, the Venezuelan government has mobilised no fewer than four million army reservists to defend “la patria“. Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced plans to reinforce the country’s anti-narcotics efforts through the deployment of military vessels and 15,000 troops to patrol the country’s “territorial waters.” President Maduro said on Monday that all branches of Venezuela’s armed forces were prepared to defend the country. Thousands of civilians joined a voluntary militia enrolment drive in public squares over the past weekend. At the international level, Venezuela’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations called on member states to demand an end to the US’ “hostile actions”. Some countries in the region, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, have expressed alarm about the US’ deployment of so much naval hardware so close to Venezuelan waters. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. The 11 member nations of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA-TCP) unanimously condemned the US threat to regional stability. However, other governments in the region have sided with Washington and even offered up their land and waters for US troop movements. France Joins the Ruckus France has decided to join the ruckus by sending more ships to Guadeloupe, its overseas territory in the Caribbean. The Macron government claims its naval reinforcements are part of an international cooperation effort to regime change Venezuela against criminal networks in the area, and stressed the need to protect its overseas territories, in particular Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are often used as transit points for drug trafficking to Europe. The move comes, ironically, as fears of a French government collapse send its borrowing costs soaring. In fact, one thing that all three of Europe’s largest economies, Germany, the UK and France, have in common is their growing financial pains. Both France and the UK now have higher yields on their ten-year bonds than Spain and Greece, and their is even talk in both countries of the possible need for an IMF bailout. Meanwhile Germany’s Chancellor (and former BlackRock board member) Friedrich Merz has warned that Germany’s welfare state model is no longer sustainable. As Yves would say, quelle surprise! Something else that unites the three countries is their governments’ determination to expand their military spending, at US insistence, despite their rapidly deteriorating finances. While French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou plans to freeze welfare payments, reduce pensioners’ benefits and abolish two national holidays, the one area where spending will dramatically increase is the military. As the French government deplores the state of its finances at home, it is sending military vessels to the Caribbean to join the US’ latest act of imperial misadventure. Which invites the question: will other US client and vassal states in Europe and Latin America be doing the same in the coming days and weeks? Is the US trying to build a “coalition of the willing” against Venezuela, just as it did against Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya with such disastrous consequences? There are certainly moves in that direction. Trinidad and Tobago’s recently elected right-leaning government last week expressed its support for the US naval operation, noting that organized crime and drug trafficking pose a direct threat to the security of the entire Caribbean. Desperate to court favours in Washington, the government also offered up its waters and territory for US operations against Venezuela if Washington requests them — to defend neighbouring Guyana, of course. The Essequibo Border Dispute For its part, the Guyanese government has also called for the strengthening of cooperation against transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism, in direct reference to the criminal organisation Cartel of the Suns. The President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, said last Saturday that his country is willing to take actions to defend its territory and sovereignty in the “new environment”. This is a reference to the escalating border dispute between Guyana (formerly British Guyana) and Venezuela over the Essequibo, a 160,000 square-kilometre oil-soaked territory that is on track to become Exxon Mobil’s largest single source of revenue by the end of this decade and which the US, unsurprisingly, would like to turn into a military outpost. For Guyana, the huge oil discoveries could end up being as much as curse as a blessing, as the NYT reported last year: The deal that made [Exxon’s success] ´possible — and which gave Exxon Mobil the bulk of the proceeds — has been a point of public outcry and even a lawsuit, with a seeming consensus that Guyana got the short end of the stick. But the deal has nonetheless generated $3.5 billion so far for the country, more money than it has ever seen, significantly more than it gained from conserving trees. It’s enough to chart a new destiny. But that new destiny has already included escalating tensions with its much larger neighbour, Venezuela, and risks turning Guyana into another disposable pawn in the furtherance of US geostrategic interests in its direct neighbourhood. As we warned in November 2023, this centuries-old dispute in an oil-rich corner of South America has the potential to become the next geopolitical flashpoint: Essequibo is not only rich in oil and gas; it boasts other mineral deposits, including Gold and Bauxite, as well as huge fish stocks and fresh water supplies, which a government minister even recently talked about exporting to other countries. As the Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), General Laura Richardson, said in January, Latin America is home to 31% of the world’s fresh water. But for the moment, it is Guyana’s vast untapped energy supplies that are of prime interest to US and global corporations. According to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, Guyana’s coastal area has roughly 13.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and 32 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves waiting to be drilled. For a country with one of the lowest population densities on the planet and a GDP of slightly less than $10 billion, a bonanza awaits. But Caracas contends that the untapped energy supplies belong to Venezuela and that the arbitration panel that granted Guyana jurisdiction over Essequibo was rigged. A Meagre Coalition So Far So far, four countries in the region have designated the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organisation: the United States, Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina. My guess is that Peru will be next in line. Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has already said that she has “not the slightest doubt” that Peru, like other countries in the region, will join this latest US-led charge against the Maduro government. However, as coalitions go, this one is pretty meagre. One country that is missing is Colombia, which has played a key role in previous regime change attempts, including Juan Guaidó’s risible coup attempt in 2019. However, since the election of left-leaning Gustavo Petro as president in 2022, Colombia has tried to replace its alignment with the US with multilateral relations, even going so far as to join the BRICS’ New Development Bank and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. When Petro took the reins as president, diplomatic ties between Colombia and Venezuela were essentially on hold. Since then relations have gradually been re-established. In recent months Petro has even proposed building a confederation of nations with neighbouring countries (Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) based on the former Greater Colombia that existed between 1819 and 1931 and comprised the four aforementioned countries. It will be very interesting to see how Colombia responds to developments in Venezuela. A few days ago, Maduro announced the movement of 15,000 troops to Venezuela’s border with Colombia earlier this week. Then yesterday (Aug 28), Gustavo Petro announced the movement of 25,000 Colombian troops to the other side of that border, which has been greeted positively by the Maduro government. This border region has long been a focal point of violent clashes between government forces (on both sides), insurgency and paramilitary groups. Lest we forget, Colombia is trying to put behind it 52 years of civil war. However, political violence is once again rearing its ugly head. A few weeks ago, the opposition politician Miguel Uribe finally succumbed to the injuries he sustained in an assassination attempt in mid-June. In addition, a car bomb was recently set off next to a military base in Cali and a police helicopter downed in the town of Amalfi. In total, 19 people were killed and 65 injured in the two attacks. The car bomb explosion in Cali has been described by local media as the “worst terrorist attack” in the country since 2019, when ELN guerrillas staged a car bomb attack against the General Santander police school, in the south of Bogotá, leaving 21 dead. Both attacks were attributed to dissident factions of the now-extinct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. President Petro described what happened as “a day of death.” One can imagine Petro spending much of his time looking over his shoulder. Colombia is home to at least seven US military bases, and was until recently considered by many, including Hugo Chávez, as the Israel of Latin America. But Petro has tried to change that — first, by building alliances with other Global South countries, and second, by severing ties with Israel over its genocide in Gaza. In the process, he will have made lots of enemies, at home and abroad. In July, audio recordings were released in which Petro’s former Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva could be heard talking about organising a coup against the Petro government. Israel is also stirring the pot, as the veteran journalist Gonzalo Guillén warned in a tweet yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime and the far right in general are promoting an irresponsible and fallacious narrative: that Hezbollah terrorism is hiding on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. This claim, besides being completely unsubstsantiated and absurd, clearly aims to ignite the region and destabilise both countries. This accusation is entirely baseless and has serious geopolitical implications. They seek to generate chaos, confrontation, and destruction. Does the Cartel de los Soles Actually Exist? This is a question NC reader Veronius asked in a comment to our previous post on Venezuela. According to Gustavo Petro, the answer is a definitive “no”. “It is the fictitious excuse used by the far right to overthrow governments that do not obey them,” Petro wrote on X earlier this week. In so doing, he opened up an intriguing can of worms. According to US government agencies, there is more than sufficient evidence tying senior Venezuelan army commanders and senior members of the Maduro government to drug trafficking. But not everyone agrees. Even the former Venezuelan presidential candidate Enrique Capriles, who is certainly no friend of the Maduro government, has said in an interview with CNN (see below) that the US government needs to back up its claims with evidence. We, Venezuelans, don’t know who is part of the Cartel de los Soles. I don’t have any information on that. I can’t provide it and I think the United States needs to present the evidence. Such a serious accusation requires putting the proof on the table. Who are the members of the Cartel de los Soles? Who runs it, where does it operate? But not just in rhetoric, show the evidence. La extrema derecha venezolana desplegó una campaña de acoso y derribo contra Henrique Capriles porque pide algo de sentido común: mostrar las pruebas de ese supuesto Cartel de los Soles, quiénes operan y dónde. "De una acusación tan grave, hay que poner las pruebas sobre la mesa" https://t.co/NzSUUezGiA — Karen Méndez (@Karenmendezl) August 29, 2025 If the Cartel de los Soles does indeed exist, one thing is clear: it is not nearly as big a player in the global drugs trade as the Trump administration is making out — and certainly not as big a player as the US government itself. As we noted in our previous post, the US is arguably the largest enabler of drug trafficking organisations on the planet: [This it does] while waging a Global War on Drugs, just as it has been arguably the largest supporter of Islamist terrorist organisations while waging a Global War on Terror. Both types of organisations have proven to be useful allies in the pursuance of US imperial ambitions (e.g. the Colombian and Mexican cartels during Nicaragua’s Contra insurgency in the 1980s, or the Al Qaeda offshoots in Syria) while also serving as handy pretexts for military intervention. It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, doing something the US military never could, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. pic.twitter.com/LcAFqA317a — MintPress News (@MintPressNews) August 7, 2023 According to the official narrative, shaped over the past decade by US government agencies and Western media, the Cartel de los Soles is a loose-knit network of Venezuelan generals and politicians that are involved in drug trafficking, in alliance with Colombian and Mexican cartels. The organisation came into existence some time in the ’90s when army officials began taking kickbacks from Colombian cartels. The name “Cartel of Suns” allegedly comes from the emblems that looked like suns on the generals’ uniforms. To date, the US has prosecuted two Venezuelan generals on charges related to drug trafficking. In the most recent case, Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former head of military intelligence in Venezuela during Hugo Chávez’s government, last month pled guilty to trafficking cocaine to the US in a narcoterrorism conspiracy. As the journalist Antonio Maria Delgado reported in the Miami Herald, Carvajal also claims to have evidence about Venezuela’s involvement with Iran and Colombia’s FARC, espionage within the US, and Maduro’s ties with the Tren de Aragua gang, which serves as a “paramilitary arm of the state” and which has also been designated by the US as a terrorist organisation. However, Delgado notes, “Carvajal has a history of shifting loyalties and politically motivated statements”. Of course, the idea of army generals taking kickbacks from drug trafficking organisations is totally believable. It happens all over the world. Whether in Mexico, Afghanistan, Myanmar or Colombia, wherever large volumes of drugs are being cultivated, processed, or distributed, rest assured that some (often senior) army officers are getting a cut of the action for looking the other way, or even for helping with the distribution. A perfect case in point: “Tim told me about basically a gang … a drug-trafficking organization within the military,” made up of “an unspoken group of soldiers that policed themselves.” Inside Fort Bragg's Secret Cartel and Unsolved Murders: https://t.co/ZSgmHIFaZN https://t.co/Fqfqg9RZbq pic.twitter.com/HsspVifLCv — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) July 28, 2025 As Venezuela Analysis notes, reports from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) itself state that less than 10% of US-bound cocaine flowed through Venezuela and the Eastern Caribbean corridor: A 2020 document from the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) by Venezuelan government critics Geoff Ramsey and David Smilde concluded that the country “is not a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine” and that the bulk of drug shipments reach US territory via Washington-allied countries in Central America. In more recent years, Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine, with some reports suggesting that as much as 70% of the global cocaine supply passes through the country. Curiously, the Cartel de los Soles does not merit a single mention in the DEA’s National Drug Threat Assessment from last year. Nor is it mentioned in previous editions I’ve checked. Even in the 2025 edition, which was written under the Trump administration, “Cartel de los Soles” does not appear once. If the organisation is such a threat, why doesn’t it feature once in the DEA’s threat assessment? The European Drug Report 2025, based on real data and not on geopolitical interests, does not mention Venezuela once as an international drug trafficking route. Even more damning is an article by Pino Arlacci, the former Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime. Here is a brief excerpt, though the article is well worth reading in its entirety (if you don’t speak Spanish, use a machine translator): During my tenure as Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime, I was in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, but I never visited Venezuela. There was simply no need. The Venezuelan government’s cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking was one of the best in South America; it can be compared only to Cuba’s impeccable record. This fact, in Trump’s delusional narrative of “Venezuela as a narco-state,” sounds like a geopolitically motivated slander. But the data, published in the 2025 World Drug Report of the organization I had the honor of leading, tell an opposite story to the one spread by the Trump administration. A story that dismantles piece by piece the geopolitical framework built around the “Cartel of the Suns”, an entity as legendary as the Loch Ness Monster, but apt to justify sanctions, embargoes and threats of military intervention against a country that, coincidentally, is located on one of the largest oil reserves on the planet… The “Cartel of the Suns” is a creation of Trump’s imagination. It is supposedly led by the president of Venezuela, but it is not mentioned in the report of the world’s main anti-drug agency, nor in the documents of any European agency or almost any other anti-crime agency in the world. Not even a footnote. A deafening silence, which should make anyone who even has a minimum of critical thinking reflect. How can such a powerful criminal organization, deserving of a $50 million bounty, be completely ignored by those working in the anti-drug field?… While Washington is stirring up the issue of Venezuela, the real centers of drug trafficking prosper almost undisturbed. In Ecuador, for example, 57% of the containers of bananas that leave Guayaquil arrive in Belgium loaded with cocaine. European authorities seized 13 tons of cocaine from a Spanish ship coming from Ecuadorian ports, controlled by companies protected by Ecuadorian government officials. The European Union produced a detailed report on the ports of Guayaquil, which describes how “Colombian, Mexican and Albanian mafias operate extensively in Ecuador.” The homicide rate in this country has skyrocketed from 7.8 per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2020 to 45.7 in 2023. But little is said about it. Perhaps because Ecuador produces only 0.5% of the world’s oil and because its government does not have a bad habit of challenging US dominance in Latin America? Lastly, something else that caught my eye during my research for this article was Wikipedia’s Spanish-language page on the Cartel de los Soles. On Google Search, the blurb below the title, which should match the first line or two of text on the corresponding Wikipedia page, reads as follows, or at least did so yesterday (translation and emphasis my own): The Cartel de los Soles is a supposed criminal and terrorist organisation led, according to the President of the United States, by senior military officers… In other words, even Wikipedia was still expressing doubts about its existence until a couple of days ago, and the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by Venezuelan senior military officers is sourced directly from the US government. However, if you click on the link, here’s what you now see: Translation (emphasis my own): The Cartel of the Suns is an illicit, criminal, and terrorist organization headed by high-ranking members of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces since the 1990s, according to some media outlets,[1] whose objective is primarily cocaine trafficking,[2] fuel smuggling,[3][4] control of illegal mining activity in several states of Venezuela, with direct participation in the extraction and smuggling of gold, coltan, precious stones and other minerals. [5] In other words, not only has the qualifier “supposed” been edited out of the text, expelling all doubt from readers’ minds, but also the reference to the president of the United States as the primary source for the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by senior military commanders of Venezuela’s armed forces. In its place as the new source for this information is “some media outlets”. And just like that, with a couple of minor tweaks to the text, all doubt is removed from the reader’s unsuspecting mind. And that, it seems, is one way that consent for US military operations is manufactured in today’s digital world. ‘The coalition of the willing’ is to normalize the militarism of the west (just as ‘weaponize’ is lazy semantics for propaganda). There is not ‘coalition of the willing’, there is only a groups of far right militarist western governments that seek global domination. There is no ‘willing’ population for these wars (if there were, then where are the lines for military recruitment?) . Do not join in the marketing jingoism of the imperialists do attack them, it is important to deconstruct their language, to show that not only their arguments but the foundations of its construct are erroneous You raise a fair point, haradan, and it is one that I will certainly keep in mind for the future. Unfortunately, because the expression in question is in the title of the post, it’s too late to change it. There maybe is not a coalition of the willing population, but there sure is a coalition of the willing governments. They are willing, and eager, though maybe lacking on the ‘able’. Has the CIA been messing with Wikipedia again? Nostalgia fans will remember when Reagan claimed he supported the Contras to keep Nicaragua from attacking our southern border. Before that Adolf kicked off WW2 in response to Polish aggression. As Jean Renoir says in Rules of the Game, “everybody has their reasons.” Still if regime change in Venezuela is in the cards who will do the invading? Unlike Kissinger’s Chile coup the army there seems to be on Maduro’s side. Perhaps it’s all simply a plan to give General Laura and her minions something to do. In a recent Nima talk Richard Wolff suggests that ever since the Great Depression the US economy has run on military Keynsianism. Are Macron and the Euros out to do the same? Somebody hold him back. Perhaps the whole point of this operation was a sort of litmus test while Trump is trying to make himself appear tough in front of his base. It is to gauge how much support there would be for a future move on Venezuela. Thing is, by the time one is organized France may be under IMF restrictions so could not help out much. Some of those US allies/vassals in South America may want to help but Venezuela has a lot of people running around with guns and you would not want to be a foreign force stuck in that country. The US has the missiles to hit Venezuela but not the troops to occupy the country. So perhaps it was also a test of how many people in Venezuela would support a colour revolution. Not a lot by the look of it. If Trump was smart he could make a deal with Venezuela for good terms in buying their oil and boast of it but I do not think that the neocons like Rubio will let him. But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump. “But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump.” Thanks for that, Rev. Isn’t the US government sufficiently preoccupied with a very large war and a genocide already? (Not to mention the ever-dreamt about war against China). They also got the boot from the Red Sea by the Yemenis. Why should anyone expect more success against Venezuela? Real empire collapse times going on. If they do in fact try this outlandish idea, I wonder how the public will like seeing US troops returning in coffins, as during Vietnam times. Will the government double down and start a war with Mexico in order to distract from a Venezuelan debacle? At that rate, it’ll eventually have to be at war against the entire planet. The US will not be sending 4,000 troops into battle in Venezuela. It would be a massacre. As mentioned in my previous post, if this does kick off (still a reasonably large “IF”), the US will be waging hybrid warfare against Venezuela (cyberattacks, attacks on infrastructure, maybe even drone and missile attacks like in Iran) while hoping the locals do all the heavy lifting. The only ones occupying body bags and coffins, I imagine, will be Venezuelans and other South Americans. You’re probably right on that count (since time immemorial the ones to pay the price of the Monroe Doctrine have been the South and Central Americans, not US citizens); but given the tremendously self-destructive activity the US has been engaging on (the tariffs being the most egregious example), I’ve become quite unsure about US rationality. Maybe a waning power could be delusional enough to think a few thousand troops would somehow collapse the government. And yeah, if they do try it’s going to make the Bay of Pigs look good. Just spitballing here off of Nick’s comment above, but maybe the force that will fight the Venezuelans is meant to come from Colombia. It seems very odd to me that Colombia would amass military forces on the border with Venezuela and this would be described as a “show of support”. It also could be labeled as a possible invasion force. It’s also extremely odd that the president of Colombia would send a large number of troops to that border when it is currently being heavily attacked by FARC dissidents in the last couple of weeks. How would the military feel about having been attacked in country by their own drug cartels, that they are now being sent as defenders of Venezuela, which is accused of supporting drug cartels? (Not that I believe this propaganda at all, but of course some of the military in Colombia might.) How good is Petro’s relationship with his own military? The military was previously fighting the FARC, but under Petro the fight was dropped. The military must not be happy with this. Further spitballing, you say that Guyana used to be a British colony. British intelligence is famous for highly deceptive plots. That’s also throw in Israeli intelligence given their meddling in this affair, and we’ve also got the French on side. This plot could not only be seen as a way to attack Venezuela, but also as a way to destabilize Colombia and bring a military coup there. Now obviously these are just fever dreams I’m having, but I wanted to share them anyway, just in case others may contribute more info. As an aside, I am currently in Bogota again for the next week. Things seem peaceful and normal here from what I see in my very safe neighborhood. I will ask my host about this issue, he seems pretty well informed generally. saludos I was wondering if China’s investments in Venezuela have included some shore based anti-ship missiles? Wouldn’t surprise me. Russia’s definitely helping Venezuela to manufacture munitions. Iran has been helping them develop drones for over a decade. Mauro Marcano, a journalist, was murdered for shedding light over the “Cartel de los soles” already back in 2004. Courts later sided with the drug lord who arranged his murder. https://rsf.org/en/victory-impunity-court-acquits-alleged-drug-baron-journalists-murder It is a shame that over 20 year later there still seem to be doubts about the Cartel’s existence. I think the point is that while there are certainly people in high places taking kickbacks from actual drug lords, this may not constitute a “cartel” by the normal definition of the word. I did check the link and I’m not all that familiar with Reporters Without Borders, but a glance at the home page indicates that they coincidentally have a lot of beefs with the very countries the US would like to regime change. Anybody else know more about this group? Another compromised NGO? Just because something existed 20 years ago does not mean it exists now. Given the US’ repeatedly proven propensity just to lie when it wants to and inability to provide evidence, my money is on it not existing; otherwise t would be splashed all over network news by now. FWIW, I’m currently reading Provoked by Scott Horton. While he clearly has an agenda, his references appear to be incredibly comprehensive. The book documents the absolutely vomit-inducing hypocrisy and mendacity of Washington over decades of war mongering, regime change, and war crimes. A distinctive element of the 2025 World Drug Report is its minimal mention of Venezuela, stating only a marginal fraction of Colombian drug production passes through the country to the Caribbean, US and Europe. The report from the highest global institution coordinating government drug policies makes no mention of the so-called Cartel of the Suns, which allegedly operates from Venezuela. For comparison, the European Drug Report 2025: Trends and Progress, published by the European Union, mentions no role for Venezuela as an international drug trafficking corridor. Though the European report states cocaine is the second most used drug in the EU’s 27 countries, Venezuela is unmentioned. Significant references appear for Colombia and Ecuador. https://orinocotribune.com/un-and-eu-confirm-venezuela-far-from-being-a-narco-country/ Well, the acquitted defendant, Garcia, was extradited from Trinidad to Venezuela and charged by the Venezuelan government. The murdered man had accused him of being the “head” of a cartel by that name, but I don’t see where he provided any evidence. In any case, Garcia seems to have had no government connections and the fact that he fled to Trinidad and was extradited suggests that he had no expectation of impunity. The cartel in this case, if it existed, would seem to have been a localised one, sharing nothing but maybe a name with the massive spectre supposedly headed by Maduro The global saber-rattling will ensure that more of all countries’ budgets go to military and surveillance spending rather than other needs for the people of various states. Everywhere one turns, there are military maneuvers. That is considered a win for those with infected with rabid neoliberal economic ideology. In addition to profits for the prison/detention industrial complex and redefining immigration statuses, the border lock-down frenzy is also happening in anticipation more conflict causing destabilization in all parts of the world. What’s more frightening than the usual strategy of “let’s find a country we can rape and steal its oil” is that the deep state and all the other nut-case neocons are thinking again in Zbigniew Brzezinski “Big Picture” terms, as “we may have to give up on the Eastern Hemishpere, so let’s really double down on controlling the other half of the planet.” Kind of like a new Monroe Doctrine. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. I don’t understand why these countries can’t simply exchange oil for equipment and goods. Wouldn’t that allow them to bypass USA sanctions? Am I missing something? This kind of trade has been common for centuries.” Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now faces one of its heaviest backlogs in the digital asset space, with at least 92 cryptocurrency exchange-traded product applications awaiting review. According to an expert, Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) lead the wave of filings, each with multiple applications under consideration. The trend highlights growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure through regulated investment vehicles, even as the SEC continues to weigh its stance on crypto products. The pace of new filings has accelerated in recent months, suggesting the market is preparing for a broader expansion of crypto ETFs. Solana and XRP have emerged as the frontrunners among altcoins in ETF interest. Analyst James Seyffart reported that Solana currently has eight ETF applications pending, while XRP has seven. Both tokens rank among the most actively pursued crypto assets after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on April 21 that 72 crypto-related ETFs were already awaiting SEC review at that time. With the figure now at 92, a further 20 applications have been added in just four months, pointing to rising momentum across the industry. The filings include proposals offering exposure not only to Solana and XRP but also to other altcoins, alongside three ETFs linked to Bitcoin and Ether. Two of the largest players in the digital asset space, Grayscale and 21Shares, are also part of the current SEC queue. Both are seeking approval for Ether staking ETFs. Earlier this month, the SEC clarified that some liquid staking activities fall outside its regulatory scope, a development that may impact how such filings are assessed. Grayscale is also pursuing a major conversion of five of its existing trusts into ETFs. These include three publicly traded funds and two private trusts, covering exposure to Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. Such conversions would expand ETF access across a broader set of cryptocurrencies if approved. The potential impact of SEC decisions on altcoin markets remains a key focus for traders. Analysts at Bitfinex observed on Monday that a broader rally among altcoins is unlikely until more crypto ETFs gain approval. This view underscores the role regulatory clarity could play in shaping institutional and retail participation in the sector. Meanwhile, market commentators such as NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci have pointed to the sheer volume of filings as evidence of what they call “crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon”. While new applications continue to pile up, global asset manager BlackRock has already secured a commanding lead in the crypto ETF category. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has attracted net inflows of $58.28 billion since launch. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has accumulated $13.12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. A Wednesday report also indicated that ETHA may soon surpass Coinbase as the largest single holder of Ether. Notably, IBIT now generates more annual fee revenue for BlackRock than its flagship S&P fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). This is due to the fee structure, with IBIT carrying an expense ratio of 0.25%, compared to just 0.03% for IVV.

The second-largest crypto is up more than 17% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin’s negative return of 5.5%, CoinGecko data shows. It follows a record setting run earlier this week, where Ethereum climbed to $4,945, its highest ever price, on Sunday. “Ethereum offers a dynamic growth story,” Xu Han, director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, told Decrypt. He pointed to deflationary tokenomics post-Merge, scalability via Layer-2 adoption, and a yield-bearing staking model. On the last point, the amount of Ethereum that has been deployed for staking activity has continued to rise this year, reaching a record 35,750 ETH, or roughly $169 million, on August 2, according to data analytics platform Beaconchain. While that figure has effectively plateaued in recent weeks, structural advantages, combined with its role as the foundational layer for DeFi and tokenization, continue to attract institutional inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds, Han said. As of August, no U.S. Ethereum staking ETFs have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though some, including digital asset manager BlackRock, are hopeful that could soon change. Still, the attention remains fixed on the spot-based products, where Ethereum ETFs have staged a comeback after weathering outflows totaling $237.7 million from August 15 through to August 20. As of this week, Ethereum ETFs have garnered over $1.2 billion in inflows through Thursday, according to data from SoSoValue. Elsewhere in the market, Solana has begun to outpace its peers with a 7% gain noted since mid-August, coinciding with a 31% surge in Solana’s DEX volume to $5.10 billion over the past week, per DeFiLlama. Though it faces its own troubles with retail traders on Solana-based decentralized exchanges having pivoted away from speculative meme coin trading, leading to a crunch in the daily DEX trader count.

Title: Letters: Why divided Labour Party should pull a Rabbitte out of the hat in race for Áras

Former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte could be just the solution for party members to resolve differences concerning presidential election nomination One might think a small party like Labour could pull together. However, former leader Alan Kelly has caused quite a stir by saying he is opposed to its endorsement of Independent TD Catherine Connolly as a presidential election candidate. Mr Kelly has proved himself by surviving in the cockpit of North Tipperary in the last few elections. He is still well thought of in political circles, so his opposition is a blow to the party and leader Ivana Bacik. I may have a solution for Labour. Why not pull “a Rabbitte” out of the hat? The Labour Party should go cap in hand to Pat, another former leader, and beg him to be its candidate. I have always said he is the only credible Labour candidate for this election. He comes from the west of Ireland and has represented Dublin for many years and still has a profile. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo An Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, mostly journal­ists and medics (‘Israel claims ‘double-tap’ strike on hospital that killed 20, including five journalists, targeted Hamas camera’, Irish Independent, August 26), has been justified by Israel because of a “surveillance camera”. Really? A camera? People who are starving, with little drinking water, no medicine and no hope of any shipments due to the Israeli control of aid and access are able to get high-tech equipment somehow and then decide to install it in their hospitals? Israel is so used to getting away with excuses that lack truth that it will tell the media just about anything. We could ask why it had to bomb the camera when there were journal­ists and medics responding to the first bomb. Why not take out the camera at 3am to minimise civilian casualties? Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Israel continues its massacres in Gaza; Russia continues the slaughter in Ukraine. The international comm­unity and the UN have failed. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize. Solution: President Trump stops all US support for Israel and maximises US support for Ukraine. The wars end. President Trump wins the Nobel Prize. The global economy improves. US businesses thrive. This makes America great again. Chris Fitzpatrick, Dublin 6 The recent meeting of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders seems to have left us with more questions than answers. Trump indicated broadly that America would support the security of Ukraine. However, no specifics were given, as is the case with many of Trump’s statements. Apparently, land exchanges were part of the private discussions between the leaders. At this crucial juncture, it would be more beneficial for Ukraine to exchange land with the US as a pay-off for security now and into the future. After all, Trump is a transactional president, and it would also be in ­Europe’s interest in the longer term. Talks of bilateral and trilateral meetings, and the protracted nature of these, could well expose us to the volatile side of Trump and leave Ukraine totally exposed. Denis O Keeffe, Lisnagry, Co Limerick At a demonstration outside the Irish Central Bank this week, Dr Bridget Kiely called on Irish people to seek options to drugs made by Israeli firms (‘Hundreds rally against Central Bank role in Israeli “war bonds”’, Irish independent, August 27). The most famous of the Israeli drug firms is Teva. It has two facilities in Ireland that employ 650 highly skilled people. Its output is supplied to the HSE and also exported to 30 countries. Why should Irish jobs be put in jeopardy when, to end the war in Gaza, Hamas has only to release its Israeli hostages, disarm and disband? Karl Martin, Dublin 13 The Pope should go to Gaza. Until now, his approach has been entirely vocal and diplomatic – his actions have been limited to public statements, telegrams and high-level phone calls. The world’s collective conscience has finally awoken and public opinion has undergone a seismic shift, with people publicly demonstrating their horror and revulsion at the genocide in Gaza. A population is being annihilated, and this is why Pope Leo should go to Gaza. The Pope is in a unique position, invested with a universally recognised moral authority. Now is the time to eschew diplomacy for moral leadership. Action, not rhetoric, will honour Christ’s example. Eileen Seery, Gorey, Co Wexford It was heartbreaking to learn that on Wednesday, two children aged eight and 10 were killed and 17 other people were injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. I get so angry when I hear how easy it is to obtain a gun in the US. In America, gun ownership is a widespread and complex issue, with a diverse range of perspectives. About 77 million adults own guns there, with self-protection being the main reason for having them. However, views on gun control and the role of firearms in society vary widely, even within different groups of gun owners. It’s when one hears of a tragedy, such as the one in Minneapolis, that one would hope the powers that be in the US might consider banning ownership of guns. If the American authorities ignore such a call, we will be hearing about more of these awful tragedies.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market is paying close attention after one of the most famous early Bitcoin voices shared a bold view on XRP. Davinci Jeremie, who gained notoriety for advising people to buy Bitcoin at just $1 back in 2013, has now issued a strong forecast for XRP, noting that the token’s chart displays a healthy structure and a bullish pattern. In his detailed breakdown, Jeremie focused on XRP’s recent movements and the structure forming on its chart. He pointed to a clear W-shaped pattern as a bullish signal. According to him, the market action that pushed XRP higher in recent weeks appeared to be organic, with genuine investor activity providing support rather than artificial manipulation. Jeremie explained that he used the Fibonacci extension levels to calculate possible price targets for XRP. He said the 1.618 level comes in at 4,555 Chilean pesos, but he believes the token could go slightly higher. His projection puts the token at 4,761 pesos, which converts to about $4.93. If this outlook materializes, XRP would not only maintain its current momentum but also surpass its previous all-time high of $3.65, which it met in July of this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s earlier moves in late 2024 appeared forced, with extreme jumps that raised doubts, but this newest action looks more natural and could carry further implications. He emphasized that the chart math and price behavior support the path to further bullish growth, while the token’s structure itself demonstrates clear strength. What makes this analysis stand out even more is who it is coming from. Davinci Jeremie has long been regarded as a strong supporter of Bitcoin, often described as a Bitcoin maximalist. His early call for people to buy BTC when the price was at only $1 has given him lasting credibility in the cryptocurrency space. For that reason, his positive comments on XRP are being taken very seriously by many in the market. Jeremie emphasized that XRP’s moves from January to June formed a clean W formation on the weekly chart. He explained how the token reached a high of $ 3.40 in January, dropped to around $2.11 in April, rebounded to $2.60 in May, declined to near $2 in June, and then rallied strongly to surpass its January high. That sequence, he said, completed the pattern and opened the door for more gains. His change of tone shows that a strong market structure can override token bias. Even for someone who has close ties to Bitcoin, the health of XRP’s current chart was enough to spark a bullish outlook. Jeremie’s analysis suggests that more investors may start looking at XRP differently, seeing it as an asset with room to grow beyond old expectations.

Title: Bad AI Integration Has Consequences. How To Avoid Common Pitfalls
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2025/08/28/bad-ai-integration-has-consequences-how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls/

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Bringing AI to your enterprise is an important step, but not doing it the right way can be costly. A new study from Infosys found that 95% of C-suite and director-level executives have had a negative experience with enterprise AI use in the last two years. These problems spanned a number of issues. About a third of all recipients reported they had experienced issues in each of these categories: privacy violations, systemic failures, inaccurate or harmful predictions, ethical violations, bias or discrimination, regulatory noncompliance or a lack of explainability. Of those who saw consequences from AI, 33% said the damage was substantial, while 39% classified it as severe—with a third of those saying the AI issues threatened their company’s existence. More than three quarters of companies negatively impacted by AI suffered financial losses, either through revenue lost or increased costs. This isn’t an indictment of AI as a technology, however. Infosys found that many of these companies had not yet laid the framework for responsible AI—determining rules and governance to ensure that AI is trustworthy, mitigates risk, protects data and functions with a degree of environmental sustainability. Fewer than 2% of the 1,500 companies Infosys surveyed for this report have a fully operational responsible AI framework, but the vast majority are starting on the path to develop these policies. In fact, 78% said they believe a responsible AI framework will increase business growth. More than four out of five said they believe regulations on AI would help them develop and further use the technology, bringing better clarity and confidence to AI compliance, with ethical and legal standards that will drive consumer trust. Creating workforce policies for responsible AI takes time and deep discussion, but it is possible. (And likely very necessary, since it does not look like there will be any widespread AI regulation in the U.S. in the near future.) Companies need to look at building trustworthy systems, which not only safeguard data, but also can explain their findings. Companies should also play an active role in observing what the AI systems are doing, and retooling the system when findings aren’t appropriate. They should consider things that might go wrong, and make sure the systems are secure and will perform accurately under these conditions. And they should ensure that they’re taking environmental sustainability into account. AI technology requires a lot of power, and as more entities embrace AI, energy demand will skyrocket. Energy efficient models will not only keep costs down, but minimize your carbon footprint. But as all tech leaders know, you don’t need AI for things to go wrong in an enterprise system. This summer, hacking network Scattered Spider has turned its attention to transportation, and has successfully disrupted flights and schedules for five airlines so far. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso, about Scattered Spider, its tactics, and how you can prepare your company. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The world’s most valuable company had two huge pieces of news this week. Nvidia released its new AI “robot brain,” the Jetson AGX Thor, and (again) broke a record with its most recent earnings report. Nvidia’s Jetson Thor platform for industrial AI delivers 7.5x better AI performance than its predecessor, the Jetson AGX Orin, and has about 3.5x better energy efficiency, writes Forbes senior contributor Janakiram MSV. He writes that the new platform brings real-time, intelligent interaction with the physical world to industrial robots. With the chip, factory robots could be able to perform several tasks at once, like visible product inspection and coordination with other robots. Forbes senior contributor Dave Altavilla runs down the tech specs of the new platform and its developer tools. He writes that the platform is not only top-of-the-line for robotics—it uses Nvidia’s Blackwell technology—but it’s also furthering Nvidia’s current strategic focus: owning the high-end performance market. The Jetson Thor platform didn’t figure into Nvidia’s latest earnings report, released after markets closed on Wednesday, but the company once again had a record-setting quarter. Revenues were $46.7 billion, surpassing its record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter, and beating economists’ forecasts. The largest portion of its revenues came from data centers, which brought in $41.1 billion. However, analysts predicted this area would come in at $41.3 billion. The miss brought a slight drop to Nvidia’s stock on Thursday morning. President Donald Trump has inserted the White House and federal government into business in an unprecedented way. Last week, he brokered a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like this one. He’s already inserted the federal government into the AI business, making a deal with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 84% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. This summer, hacker group Scattered Spider has certainly helped make travel more difficult. After a warning from the FBI that they were likely to target airlines, Scattered Spider disrupted flights on five airlines in two months. Most of the attacks came as a result of deception, not sophisticated hacking, with hackers calling corporate help desks and impersonating actual employees, asking for—and getting—assistance in accessing those employees’ accounts. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso Security, about Scattered Spider’s methods and how you can be ready for them on the cybersecurity front. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What should companies do to protect against these kinds of attacks? Ahl: There’s back-to-basics things. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication really helps out. But when they call the help desk and the help desk disables that, that control is gone now. You almost have to assume there’s going to be a way around MFA. Everyone put a lot of faith that MFA solves everything. It does help quite a bit, but it is not a silver bullet there. You need visibility. I think a lot of organizations are kind of still stuck on the inventory posture phase of identity. You need to know what actions are actually taking account. You’ve got to get to that runtime detection phase if you want to really do anything. And then your basics still matter. Least privilege is needed for some of these organizations. A bad guy is going to steal some data from Snowflake. Well, they’re clicking in with an account that hasn’t touched Snowflake in 12 months. Should that account have Snowflake access? Probably not. Make sure you have visibility across all your applications, to include SaaS, which is unfortunately the hardest part, but is where attackers are learning most before they take action in environment. What about the help desk issue? If somebody calls the help desk and falsely claims to be somebody high level on the IT team or the CFO, what can be done to better thwart these attacks? Identity verification programs are a must. You can’t just rely on small bits of information. The hard thing with the help desk is it just takes one person who is not great at their job for the attacker to get through. And when [hackers] are doing this, they’re not doing it for just one identity. They’re calling for dozens of identities—and they’re English speaking and confident, and have a little bit of information to validate that they are who they say they are. Unfortunately, you’ve just got to do more. You almost can’t blame the help desk, either. This is what they’re designed to do: to be helpful in these situations. But most organizations, after they’ve gone through this, we see them putting in strong identity verification programs with their help desk to combat this in the future. Some of my peers in the industry are reporting deepfake videos. I haven’t seen that yet from this group, but I have heard cloned voices from them. So when they’re impersonating the CFO, they sound like the CFO. It has to be more than, ‘I recognize this voice and it sounds like this person.’ How are most companies doing with these protocols to stop these attacks? That’s the thing that is most concerning about this group for me. By the time an organization realized what’s going on—which may be hours or even less from when the incident occurred— [the hackers] have moved so far, they've captured so many other credentials that it is really hard to stop them, especially when they go from cloud to on-prem. You reset their password here in cloud. The bad guy just reset their password. It gets synced right back up to the cloud. You’re in this weird game. Where before it could take a couple days for [hackers] to really gain their feet in an environment, it’s just a couple of hours now. And for organizations that are doing well with this, I would say even some of the more high profile attacks that you've read about recently, these organizations do very well. They found it very quickly. They called in the right people, but the bad guy just moved too fast. Faster than they could. It seems that hackers are always coming up with new techniques. How can a CIO, CTO or CISO be vigilant and ward off anything that may be coming now or in the future? I would say focus more on the tactics than on the groups. The groups are going to change, but these tactics remain relatively the same. You want to put up as many speed bumps as possible to slow these guys down along the way. Is phishing-resistant MFA going to stop them? No. But it gives you more opportunity to catch them along that path. Is doing least privilege across all your applications a solution? Now we’re going to start seeing some errors along the way. Unfortunately, convenience for your employees is also convenience for the attackers. Even things like Copilot—in recent attacks from this group, instead of searching, they’ve prompted Copilot to go search SharePoint for me to figure out how to use the VPN. So do we stop our employees from being able to use Copilot? Do we restrict what type of data Copilot can use? Put up as many speed bumps as possible along that path to slow them down, give you the opportunity to disrupt them before they make it too far. When Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry said that the company processes anonymized proprietary log data to train AI models on new threat signals, it started a new debate on what trust means in an AI-enabled cybersecurity world. Here’s some ways to look at and discuss the concept, both from the provider and customer standpoint. Companies can innovate on their own, but in today’s world with its modern tech challenges, some of the best new ideas come through companies working together. Here’s a toolkit to build and scale productive partnerships for innovation. A court filing last week said that Elon Musk tried to get another tech billionaire to join his unsolicited bid to buy OpenAI. Who was it? A. Jeff Bezos B. Sergey Brin C. Larry Ellison D. Mark Zuckerberg See if you got the answer right here.

Title: Crypto Power Play: BlackRock Goes Big With Major Bitcoin And Ethereum Purchase

As the bull market cycle continues, Bitcoin and Ethereum adoption are sharply heating up among prominent figures and large corporations in the ever-evolving financial landscape. In the last few days, institutions have gone on a significant buying spree, one of which is the asset management firm BlackRock. Bitcoin’s price has steadily faced notable price fluctuations, while Ethereum’s price has experienced a pullback from its recent all-time high. Despite this bearish performance from BTC and ETH, BlackRock is purchasing the two crypto leaders on a massive scale. According to the reports, the world’s largest asset manager has acquired a staggering $750 million worth of BTC and ETH. It is worth noting that this massive accumulation by the leading firm was made within two days. The report reveals that BlackRock bought about 413 BTC valued at $46 million, along with 73,864 ETH for a staggering $342 million on August 27. Prior to this huge purchase, the asset manager made another acquisition of 568 BTC for approximately $62.6 million, and 65,901 ETH valued at $292.6 million. This rapid accumulation underscores the firm’s growing conviction in crypto as an institutional-grade asset class. While signaling rising demand among institutional investors, the huge purchase in such a short span reinforces the idea that traditional finance is sharply intertwining with the crypto sector. Combining these acquisitions, the asset manager invested close to $750 million in its cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) products within a two-day window. In 2025, these purchases rank among the biggest single-day purchases made by a conventional financial institution. Large Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, often regarded as whales, have been gradually returning to the market. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain platform, has reported an uptick in BTC and ETH whales even as bearish pressure intensifies. This growth is observed among wallet addresses holding 1,000 BTC and wallet addresses holding at least 10,000 ETH. Such a trend from high-net-worth investors signals a possible change in market dynamics for the two assets. Their comeback coincides with a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry as investors balance the long-term growth trajectory of the assets against macroeconomic uncertainty. Data from the leading on-chain platform shows that there are now 13 more wallets holding 1,000 BTC, bringing the total to 2,087 wallets. Meanwhile, for Ethereum, there is now a total of 1,275 wallets holding 10,000 ETH following an additional 48 new wallets. At the time of writing, BTC and ETH were trading at $113,182 and $4,573, respectively, in the last 24 hours. While ETH’s trading volume has declined by over 13% in the past day, BTC’s trading volume is experiencing a slight upswing of nearly 5%. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Reilly embracing the competition to be Ireland's No 9

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:59:41Z
Full Content:
Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist There's no position in the Ireland women’s team as hotly contested right now as scrum-half. Over the last 18 months, Scott Bemand has narrowed his selections down bit by bit to the point where there is no debate around his first choice in several positions. Niamh O’Dowd, Neve Jones and Linda Djougang are the locked-in front row for big games. Ruth Campbell, Sam Monaghan, Aoife Wafer, Dannah O’Brien, Aoife Dalton, Amee-Leigh Costigan and Stacey Flood also appear to be guaranteed their shirts if fit. At scrum-half, Aoibheann Reilly, Emily Lane and Molly Scuffil-McCabe have been rotating in and out. The margin between starting and missing out on the matchday 23 has been razor thin. Lane and Scuffil-McCabe shared the jersey during WXV1 campaign in Canada last year while Reilly was still on her way back from an ACL injury, with Scuffil-McCabe starting the win against New Zealand, before Lane got the nod in the games against Canada and USA. In the Six Nations, it looked as though Lane was top of the scrum-half rotation when she started the games against France and England, with Reilly (above) impressing in her chance in the 9 jersey away to Italy. Bemand continued to rotate, with Scuffil-McCabe brought into the starting side for the final two Six Nations outings, and she kept her place for the first World Cup warm-up against Scotland. For the visit of Canada, Reilly came back in, and she impressed again in Ireland's Pool C opener against Japan last week. Just as it seemed the 24-year-old had taken the jersey for herself, it now looks like another rotation is on the cards for Spain on Sunday. "That's what you want, you want competition in your squad," says Reilly, who started last week's win against the Sakura XV. "We always knew that the World Cup was coming up and it's only fair that everyone gets a chance and play with different combinations and see what works best for the team. "And we're blessed that we have depth there, because someone's game style might suit an opposition better than the other." A tally of the numbers sums up how unpredictable Bemand’s thinking has been around scrum-half. In the last 11 games, Lane is the only player to have featured in every game, but only four of those have been starts, and she hasn’t started since Round 3 of the Six Nations. Scuffil-McCabe (above) has played six times, with four of those from the start, while Reilly has started three of her five appearances. "We have depth there now, whereas maybe we didn't have it as much before," said Reilly. "And you're starting to see that not just at scrum-half, but other positions now, where other girls can put their hand up every week and there's constant competition there which is only driving us on as a squad." With Bemand and assistant coach Larissa Muldoon both former scrum-halves, Reilly says there is "constant feedback" to the trio of 9s. "It's definitely evolved me as a player and helped me see the game differently," she adds. "They both come and give different advice about different things but it's great to have the both of them, and they're all aligned with our style of play, which is great. "All of us are very different and we have different elements to our game so it's just really what suits the team at the weekend. We all compete really well together, so it's great that we're all there, pushing each other on. "I like playing with a fast-tempo game, lots of running lines. That’s probably the style I like most." Getting to a World Cup has been a milestone achievement for the Blackrock and Connacht scrum-half, given she has come back from two ACL injuries in recent seasons. Representing Ballinasloe is also a driving factor. One of three Ballinasloe RFC products in this Irish squad, Reilly has been playing with Béibhinn Parsons and Meabh Deely since she was a child. "It's unreal. It's hard to explain because it's all we've ever known," she said. "We were always on the same teams together but it's so cool to see how the town has gotten behind us. "There’s huge posters up around Ballinasloe of the three of us which is surreal, but, yeah, it's really special. "My family was over last weekend. I think they're going to all the games to support the girls and my brother came over from New York. "And it's actually his first time seeing me live so he's over for the month, which is great. "And then my other brother [Colm], he plays with Connacht so he's hoping to come for the New Zealand games. "He can't quite get it off training but it's great to have the support over. And there's so many Irish in the crowd last weekend, which was class." Listen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

Title: Globalists Are Rebranding Their “Woke Capitalism” Agenda After Crushing Setbacks

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:00:00Z

Editor Economy Alt-Market.us, Brandon Smith People who carefully track the machinations of globalist institutions might have noticed a disturbing atmosphere of silence since the 2024 elections. I discussed this trend a few months ago in my article “Globalists Go Radio Silent As NATO Flirts With World War III”, specifically the dramatic shift that has taken place since the pandemic when organizations like the World Economic Forum ripped the mask off completely and admitted their true authoritarian intentions. By the end of 2021, most of the world was under maniacal technocratic control and the globalists seemed to think they had western civilization by the balls. The elites were constantly in the media openly touting their plans, from perpetual covid lockdowns, to vaccine passports, to climate lockdowns, to cashless digital monetary systems where all economic liberty is lost, to the “sharing economy” where private property is abolished, to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in which AI runs everything, to the “Great Reset” which would completely undermine the free market system and herald a socialist dystopia. In my 20 years as an economist, writer and analyst in the liberty movement I have never seen the globalists reveal their true intentions so brazenly. The pandemic exposed an incredible number of people to the underlying reality of the “New World Order” and in that span of around three years the awakening skyrocketed. The number of patriots born during covid was unprecedented. People realized it wasn’t a mere conspiracy theory. World events were not simply random products of chance and chaos. There was indeed a smoky god-damn room filled with nefarious plotting parasites. The march towards global governance was real and now everyone except the dumbest of the dumb knows it. The powers-that-be were so confident in the success of their endeavor that they essentially proclaimed global government by bureaucrats and corporations in the very midst of covid. Calling it the “Council for Inclusive Capitalism” working in collusion with the Vatican. The question we have to ask today is, where did it all go? The globalists were so confident and bold and now they are reticent. Did they give up? Or, are they rebranding their agenda yet again? For example, in 2020 almost no one knew what ESG was. By 2023 everyone understood that the meaningless acronym for “Environmental, Social, Governance” is actually an insidious cover designed to hide the woke capitalism agenda. Woke capitalism, also known as inclusive capitalism, is a centralization program which links together governments, bureaucratic agencies, NGOs as well as international banks and corporations under one ideological umbrella (globalism, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change, etc). This massive cartel uses monetary incentives and extortion to force businesses and individuals to conform to a woke/socialist model. For the last decade these groups have been funding a suffocating propaganda campaign, forcing woke indoctrination onto the masses. However, the globalists didn’t comprehend the level of push-back that they ultimately encountered. In their arrogance, they ended up inspiring more resistance, not less. And so, terms like ESG and DEI are being abandoned. Even Lynn Forester de Rothschild, head of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, was forced to admit that ESG is dead and needs to be rebranded. Within the occult methodology the natural solution would be to adopt new organizations and new names but maintain the same goals. I’ve noticed that this happens often with the globalists. At one point the majority of their planning was done within the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group. Then it was the Club Of Rome and the UN. Then it was the IMF. Then the focus switched to Davos and the WEF. They used the term “New World Order”, then switched to “Multipolar World Order”, then to “the Great Reset” and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. This makes it very difficult for researchers to track the most current mechanisms of the conspiracy. I have found that, in the last year, “Stakeholder Capitalism” has become the fresh code for much of their renewed efforts. It’s not a new term, but it is being used more often by the elites to draw less attention. Some use the phrase “stakeholder capitalism 3.0” or “third phase stakeholder capitalism”. The original idea being that corporations can no longer make profits a priority. Rather, they must produce equal outcomes (not just equal opportunities) in order to participate in the interdependent international economy. In order to get access to the system, companies must promote approved narratives on climate and social justice, as well as partner with governments and NGOs to make DEI equity a reality. The companies that don’t participate will face pressure from government officials and will not be able to compete with companies that comply. The problem is, this requires that meritocracy be erased and that producers be forced to subsidize feeders on a planetary scale. That is to say, stakeholder capitalism is global communism cloaked in the humanist costume of corporate responsibility. The World Economic Forum seems to be doubling down on ESG and stakeholder capitalism with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the helm, despite growing public opposition. Though, Blackrock has removed a majority of ESG and DEI related language from their corporate reports. I recently came across an article published at the end of July from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance which outlines the more discreet evolution of ESG (and DEI) in 2025. It reiterates similar observations made by globalists over the past year, that ESG must be rebranded but not abandoned. It argues that the old political virtue signaling and compliance checklists of the last decade must be set aside (for now) and that stakeholder capitalism should be presented as a “win-win” for the companies and communities involved. It is, in a way, an attempt to sell conservatives on the idea of ESG. One argument is that companies that engage in ESG-like policies “make more money” and gain more share value. Limited data is produced to support this claim, and I would point out that stock markets overall have been on a frightening bull run since the election. Companies that are NOT engaging in ESG are doing just as well as those that are, at least…in the US. Harvard notes that outflows from ESG funds are prevalent in America, but in the EU they are becoming more successful. I’m seeing similar trends in Canada and Australia – Anywhere that governments are working with globalists to enforce DEI standards on companies, ESG funds are obviously going to outperform. It’s a cartel, remember, and western political leaders are the enforcers. The US is the only place where ESG is in retreat. This could change in the near term as Europeans grow increasingly rebellious against the multicultural coup, but it does illustrate the fact that woke capitalism (stakeholder capitalism) cannot survive without government intervention. This is not to say that progress in the fight against globalism has not been made. I grow tired of blackpilled mouth-breathers that act as if there have been no victories and that everything is going “according to the globalist plan”. If this was true then they would have proudly and publicly moved forward with their Great Reset instead of running back into the shadows. That said, vigilance requires temperance. Behind the scenes many corporations are still introducing woke policies and they are even advancing the globalist takeover in Europe. The fight must focus on these specific companies and their NGO partners; it is not the job of corporations (or leftist politicians and NGOs) to enact social engineering. They are not qualified to determine the greater good because they are not good people. They are driven by the desire for power, not morality or reason. The globalists have lost the information war, but they keep coming back because they have yet to face real world consequences for their hubris. The only way to end the nightmare permanently is to dissolve the structures that give them their influence, or, remove them from the equation entirely.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, with Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff admitting he got bitcoin wrong ten years ago and warned a coming dollar “crisis" could propel crypto higher. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $124,000 this month before crypto market crash fears sent it sharply lower—while traders warned they were seeing other “market top” signs. Now, as Elon Musk confirms his “only” crypto, the bitcoin price and crypto market has been primed for $20 million to $28 million of daily buying pressure as part of $84 trillion set to pass from U.S. Baby Boomers to younger heirs by 2045. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "As Baby Boomers, who collectively control more than half of the global wealth, age and begin to pass on their estates, an estimated $84 trillion is expected to change hands in the United States alone by 2045," analysts with crypto friendly Xapo Bank wrote in a report, citing research from Vanguard. “Globally, this figure reaches approximately $10.6 trillion by 2030 in the U.S., $3.5 trillion in Europe, and $2.8 trillion in Asia.” The report pointed to research that showed younger generations are more likely to invest in bitcoin and crypto than older generations. “Numerous surveys measuring crypto adoption across generations find that these younger generations have at least 3x higher adoption or acceptance rates of crypto compared to Baby Boomers,” Charles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote in 2023. Xapo researchers went on to predict the so-called “great wealth transfer” will lead to the creation of new "bitcoin dynasties," families like the Rockefellers or Rothschilds who build up generational wealth through bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious “A defining outcome of the digital asset revolution is the emergence of ‘bitcoin dynasties’—families and individuals whose multigenerational wealth is rooted in cryptocurrency holdings," the Xapo report authors wrote. "These modern dynasties are drawing comparisons to legacy wealthy families such as the Rockefellers or Rothschilds. Unlike traditional sources of wealth based in land, industrial enterprise, or equities, these dynasties are building and preserving their fortunes on the decentralised rails of blockchain technology." The bitcoin price boom since bitcoin crashed to a recent low of $16,000 in 2023 has been driven by huge adoption of crypto on Wall Street, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and its $83 trillion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto has further supported the market over the last year. On the campaign trail before retaking the White House, Trump pledged to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve similar to the U.S. gold reserve as well as a broader crypto stockpile, ordering their creation in April.

Title: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Live News Today: Latest Insights for Bitcoin Maxis (August 28)

Time Published: 2025-08-28T10:04:36Z

Check out our Live Bitcoin Hyper Updates for August 28, 2025! In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack! Disclaimer: No crypto investment comes without risk. Our content is for informational purposes, not financial advice. We may earn affiliate commissions at no extra cost to you. HOW TO BUY $HYPER Bitcoin’s sharp jump from around $108K to above $113K in just three days is a massive show of strength by the OG crypto, signaling that it wants to extend its bull run. The token has reclaimed the 100 EMA on the daily chart. This is significant because the last time $BTC interacted with this moving average, it went on to hit new all-time highs. Even better, there’s no shortage of confluence. From the current level acting as a key support zone to the token rejecting the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, all signs point toward a fresh leg up for Bitcoin. That said, for $BTC to fully shake off its temporary downward momentum, it needs to break and hold above $117,390, aka the most recent swing high. If it does, Bitcoin could be nicely set up for a potential run to new ATHs, representing at least a 10% gain from current levels. August 28, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s slowing down, you say? Sure, the price has cooled after record highs, but the market is buzzing for a different reason. The spotlight is now on Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the viral new Layer-2 that just smashed through $12.5M in the presale. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, it’s designed to fix Bitcoin’s biggest problems: sluggish speeds, high fees, and zero smart contract support. Think instant payments, cheap transactions, and dApps running on Bitcoin’s security. That’s why investors looking for the next crypto to explode are piling in. With $HYPER priced at just $0.012815 and featured in Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ it’s quickly being called one of the best crypto presales of 2025. If Bitcoin Hyper succeeds, it won’t just make Bitcoin faster – it could make it the backbone of Web3. Grab your $HYPER now before the next stage kicks in. You can use our guide to learn how to buy $HYPER. August 28, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Google has announced on LinkedIn that there’s a new Layer 1 in the works designed to be “neutral ground” for competing payment platforms. The Google Cloud Universal Ledger will support Python-based smart contracts. Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google, has teased that more information on the technical details will be available in the coming months. Google isn’t the only developer building an exciting new Layer 1 product. Stripe and Circle are also forging ahead with new Layer 1 services designed to facilitate payment processing. The increased interest in Layer 1 technologies highlights how the Bitcoin network has fallen seriously behind in terms of technical innovation, but one project seeks to change that: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). $HYPER is redefining how we think about Bitcoin by adding a Layer 2 solution based on Solana on top of the Layer 1. It’ll bring smart contract support to the Bitcoin network, opening the way for DeFi apps, NFT trades, and crypto swaps – all with the value of $BTC. We’ve already seen serious interest in the $HYPER project, as it’s just pushed through the $12.5M mark in presales. When you learn what Bitcoin Hyper is doing for the Bitcoin network’s ability to process transactions quicker (as well as lowering fees), you’ll see why it’s a necessary evolution for $BTC. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale at just $0.012815 before the next price increase. August 28, 2025 • 13:00 UTC XRP broke $3 this week, backed by record institutional flows and resilient spot support. A huge surge in CME futures open interest signals heavy institutional bets, while technical analysts are eyeing Fibonacci extensions. They’re pointing to potential long-term targets of $8, $13, and even $27. Meanwhile, the long-running SEC case against Ripple is reportedly nearing settlement at $125 M, clearing the path for regulatory clarity and even a future XRP ETF. If the sentiment holds, XRP could become the spark for a wider altcoin rally, with smart capital rotating into early-stage projects. Among those aligned with XRP’s infrastructure-driven growth is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). The project aims to bring speed and programmability to the Bitcoin blockchain. So it comes as no surprise that the $HYPER presale has already smashed through $12.5M and it is one of the best new cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. Visit the official website to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper. August 28, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Crafting a crypto portfolio for a potential bull run can undoubtedly be exciting. But at the same time, it’s no easy task, with hundreds of altcoins on the market, and each promising life-changing returns. To help you steer the boat with both speed and security (well, as ‘safe’ as crypto can be), we turned to ChatGPT and asked it to identify a low-cap, hype-driven, utility-backed project that could give your portfolio the much-needed degen edge. The result? ChatGPT picked Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as the best crypto to invest in right now. So, what’s $HYPER? Simply put, it’s a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aiming to bring Solana-like lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to the otherwise slow and non-programmable Bitcoin blockchain. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. August 28, 2025 • 11:00 UTC If we needed more proof that Bitcoin is now mainstream, here it is. A Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm filed a registration statement with the SEC this Tuesday. The healthcare provider, KindlyMD, is launching a $5B at-the-market equity raise program to build its Bitcoin treasury. According to the filing, the company’s Treasury Reserve Policy views Bitcoin as the primary reserve asset on an ongoing basis. KindlyMD also plans to continue its $BTC accumulation ‘without setting a specific target to be held.’ In a move mirroring the broader market and similar institutional-level shifts, the filing mentions the potential development of ‘Bitcoin companies’ in the finance, advisory, and media sectors. As more institutions shift to Bitcoin and fuel positive market sentiment, adjacent crypto projects attract more retail investors looking to diversify. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the latest example with a booming presale nearing $12.5M. This project is building a unique Layer-2 for Bitcoin that promises to lower network congestion, increase throughput, and bring Solana-style smart contracts to $BTC holders. See our $HYPER price prediction for more project details. August 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The Philippines could be the first country in the world to put its national budget on a blockchain if the proposal of one of its senators pushes through. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV shared this suggestion during yesterday’s session at the Manila Tech Summit. While no concrete plans have been made to implement this, having a country’s budget on-chain could provide transparency and combat corruption, as it ensures records are validated, immutable, and verifiable. The move could also increase the adoption of blockchain technology among citizens, as it would encourage them to interact with the tech to see how their government is spending their hard-earned tax money. Moreover, governments could eventually switch to using blockchain tech for payments (e.g., taxes), similar to how some tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will be used to pay for gas fees and other transaction fees within their respective ecosystems. Check out our ‘What Is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide to learn more! August 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock is now the biggest Bitcoin custodian after its IBIT spot ETF holdings hit 745,357 $BTC. By comparison, Coinbase’s holdings sit at 706,150 $BTC and Binance’s at 584,557 $BTC, according to recent onchain figures. The signal is clear: the flow of money is shifting; institutions are moving away from exchanges to secure their holdings through regulated ETFs. While this means potentially tighter liquidity, the bigger picture entails wider, easier Bitcoin exposure for retail – especially with hedge and pensions funds turning their attention to crypto. The crypto market is preparing for growing Bitcoin network activity and demand as $BTC’s daily trading volume is still in the green. Solutions like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new blockchain solution to upscale Bitcoin, are getting a lot of retail attention right now. With nearly $12.5M raised on presale so far and over 44,000 transactions recorded, the Hyper presale is one of the most popular crypto projects right now. Here’s why Hyper’s layer-2 could revolutionize Bitcoin. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Tesseract and the Future of Yield

Time Published: 2025-08-28T09:53:58Z
Full Content:
For James Harris, the newly appointed Group CEO of Tesseract, taking the helm of the Helsinki-based digital asset lender is both a culmination of years of leadership in financial technology and the beginning of a bold new chapter. “Joining Tesseract was both a natural progression and a step up,” Harris reflects. “At CoinDesk Data and Zodia Custody, I helped shape strategy and led commercial growth, but I wasn’t the final decision-maker. Having run smaller businesses in the past, I knew I was ready for the challenge of stepping into the CEO role and taking full accountability.” The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more That accountability now extends across Tesseract’s $500m in assets under management and over $1bn in originated loans. Harris inherits a company with solid foundations, a reputation for reliable yield services, a team with deep institutional experience, and strong partnerships, including with Bitstamp (now part of Robinhood). Yet, as he sees it, the company remains underappreciated in a crowded marketplace. “Tesseract has a product that works, a talented team, and a track record,” he says. “But it hasn’t yet achieved the scale or visibility it deserves. Helping it fulfils that potential and become a category-defining company in crypto yield is exactly the kind of challenge that energises me at this point in my career.” At the heart of Harris’s vision is a deceptively simple ambition: make earning yield on digital assets as safe, seamless, and predictable as holding a government bond. “Whether you’re an exchange offering Earn products to your users, or a corporate treasury looking to deploy assets responsibly, you should be able to plug into Tesseract and access curated, institutional-grade yield strategies without needing to navigate DeFi, counterparties, custody, or regulation yourself,” Harris explains. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This philosophy, what he calls “Yield as Infrastructure” underpins Tesseract’s model. The company provides a modular, API-driven platform that connects client capital to carefully managed opportunities across CeFi and DeFi. The risk, regulatory, and operational burdens are absorbed by Tesseract, freeing partners to focus on growth. “Our edge lies in that full-stack approach,” Harris says. “Most firms either focus on custody, trading, or asset management. We sit across all three, which gives us a better vantage point on risk and access. And importantly, we’re in the process of obtaining European regulatory authorisation, including specific permissions to deploy assets into DeFi something most competitors simply can’t do.” With a foundation in place, Harris is already looking two to three years ahead. “We can significantly grow AUM by expanding distribution and broadening our product shelf,” he says. Planned innovations include risk-banded yield strategies, tokenised vaults, and hybrid yield-powered asset management products tailored for fintech’s, family offices, and institutions. The company is also positioning itself as a bridge for traditional financial institutions tentatively entering the digital asset world. “There’s a huge opportunity in helping large TradFi firms dip their toes into on-chain yield in a way that’s measurable and compliant,” Harris notes. “We want to make crypto yield predictable, trusted and maybe even a little bit boring.” The timing appears right. Institutional adoption of digital assets is gathering momentum, driven by three converging forces: clearer regulation, macroeconomic pressure, and improved infrastructure. “In the US, initiatives like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts are landmark moments. In Europe, MiCA is now live. That level of clarity would have been aspirational just two years ago,” Harris argues. “When firms like BlackRock are tokenising treasuries and building on public blockchains, it’s a strong signal the tide has turned.” Meanwhile, with rate cuts looming and real yields under pressure, institutional investors are looking elsewhere for returns. Crypto-native strategies offering 5–15% through staking or protocol-based lending are increasingly difficult to ignore. “Many still assume crypto yield is either too risky or unregulated,” Harris admits. “That’s a misconception. There’s a big difference between chasing unsustainable APYs and allocating to risk-managed, on-chain strategies run by professionals with controls and accountability. The gap in understanding is narrowing, but we need to keep building trust.” To that end, Tesseract has embedded compliance, credit, and liquidity oversight into every layer of its stack. Its modular infrastructure is designed to integrate seamlessly into institutional workflows, with APIs, segregated wallets, and granular reporting. If trust is the end goal, regulation is the foundation. For Harris, Europe’s MiCA framework is both a challenge and an opportunity. “Regulation is the defining lens for any serious crypto business,” he says. “MiCA raised the bar, but it also gave institutions the clarity they’ve been waiting for. We’ve shaped our strategy around operating in this arena and expect to be fully MiCA-compliant ahead of year-end.” This requires heavy investment in compliance infrastructure and audit-ready processes, but Harris sees the payoff as significant. “Smaller players may struggle with the cost and complexity. For us, compliance becomes a competitive advantage, it attracts capital and legitimises what we do.” A particular area of focus is stablecoins, which power around 70% of DeFi yield flows. “Stablecoins are central to our strategy,” Harris explains. “We treat them like any other yield-bearing instrument: analysing issuer risk, regulatory status, reserves, and redemption mechanics. Algorithmic stablecoins we mostly avoid; fiat-backed types like USDC remain the core.” MiCA will tighten rules around stablecoins, including capping their circulation in some cases, but Harris views this as positive. “Our B2B clients want yield, but they need confidence. By combining stablecoin yields with real-world assets, staking, and protocol lending, we can offer diversified, risk-adjusted solutions.” Looking further ahead, Harris believes the most enduring innovations in decentralised finance will centre around real-world integration and institutional adoption. “Three developments stand out,” he says. “First, real-world asset tokenisation—on-chain treasuries, bonds, and money market funds will unlock over $1tn in flows by 2030. Second, cross-chain yield infrastructure like EigenLayer reduces fragmentation and expands opportunity. Third, compliant hybrids that blend DeFi yield with institutional-grade wrappers will dominate.” Harris is confident that DeFi and traditional finance are on a path of convergence. “TradFi is adopting blockchain for efficiency, while DeFi is adapting to regulatory and institutional requirements. In five years, yield products will likely look like hybrids: tokenised treasuries earning DeFi-based yield, wrapped in compliant structures and integrated directly into banks and fintechs.” Will the future be decentralised or institution-led? Harris sees a pragmatic outcome. “In terms of scale, institutions will dominate they have the capital, compliance engines, and distribution. But the energy and innovation still comes from the edges. Our job is to capture the best of both worlds and deliver compliant, risk-adjusted returns.” For all the talk of 2030, Harris is keenly focused on the next year. Milestones ahead include: “We’re not trying to do everything,” Harris stresses. “We’re focused on a few critical things we can do exceptionally well, and by doing so, build a durable platform for long-term growth.” As for the biggest misconception he’d like to put to rest. “That digital asset yields are inherently reckless,” he says firmly. “The reality is they can be responsibly managed, risk-adjusted, and institutionally scalable. That’s the future we’re building at Tesseract.”

Title: BlackRock Poised to Become Top $BTC and $ETH Custodian as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Targets $12.5M
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-surges-as-blackrock-etfs-increase-btc-eth-custody/
Time Published: 2025-08-28T09:50:46Z

BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) could soon position it as the top custodian of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. The company is nipping at the heels of Binance, which currently holds the number one spot. Prices of these coins could continue to rise as more ETFs and institutional investors stockpile them. This could see Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) get a boost from investors looking to take advantage of the speed and low transaction costs of its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. Over the past several months, BlackRock’s $BTC and $ETH ETFs have massively increased their coins in custody. Based on Arkham data, its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF’s holdings grew from only 1.1M $ETH in January to 3.6M $ETH today. Meanwhile, it expanded its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF’s $BTC holdings from 228K at the start of the year to its present 745.5K. This rapid accumulation of the top two coins has brought BlackRock’s ETFs much closer to the current leaders Binance (626.2K $BTC, 4.3M $ETH) and Coinbase (977.2K $BTC, 5.1M $ETH). In addition, continued whale buys of these cryptocurrencies continue to reduce their liquid supply, which helps push their prices higher. Higher prices, naturally, increase the attractiveness of the coins, so more traders buy or hold them. This also shines a light on projects that build upon their respective chains, especially if they make transactions cheaper or expand a coin’s utility. As the world’s top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to attract investors of all sizes. However, it’s bogged down by fundamental issues such as slow transactions, which contribute to high fees. Also, $BTC has limited applications since it can’t be used for staking or interacting with dApps. Fixing this isn’t a simple matter of rewriting Bitcoin’s underlying code, as that would weaken its security. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. This project aims to create a Bitcoin Layer 2, which should bring Solana-level speeds, low transaction costs, and expanded utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Think of it as a fast lane to Bitcoin’s heavily congested Layer 1. When launched, you’ll be able to send your $BTC to the L2 via a Canonical Bridge. This creates a wrapped $BTC of the same value on the L2. You can then use this for things $BTC couldn’t do before, like trading and staking. This high-speed environment is powered by a Solana Virtual Machine, which makes transactions significantly faster and cheaper than on the L1. To ensure that the actual amount and value of your $BTC is up to date, the L2 regularly synchronizes with the L1. Then, if you want to bring your coin back to the base layer, simply withdraw it, and it will be sent to your Bitcoin wallet address. Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to change the Bitcoin ecosystem for the better, which has seen it raise nearly $12.5M to date and become one of this year’s best presales to invest in. To get your $HYPER tokens, go to the official presale website or buy them via the Best Wallet app. Each one only costs $0.012815, making it a cheap and potentially profitable way to invest in the future of Bitcoin. Staking is another option if you want to earn passive income from your $HYPER tokens. When you do, you’ll enjoy rewards at 89% p.a. If you’re more of a long-term investor, Bitcoin Hyper’s promise as a Layer 2 could potentially result in healthy gains. Based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could be worth as much as $1.50 by 2030 when the project fully matures. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Growing interest from institutions like BlackRock is a boon for top cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH. In effect, they reduce the number of coins circulating in the market, making them scarcer and therefore more expensive. The rapid accumulation of these coins also attracts attention to projects that build upon the base blockchains. A good example is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has raised nearly $12.5M to date for its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. Disclaimer: Do your own research. This is not investment advice.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs outpace Bitcoin counterparts with $307M in Inflows

US spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $307 million in net inflows on Wednesday, extending their lead over spot bitcoin ETFs, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s ETHA drew the largest single-day inflow at $262.6 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $20.5 million. Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and ETHE, along with VanEck’s ETHV, also reported fresh inflows. By contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $81.3 million in inflows, marking a third consecutive day of positive flows but remaining well below Ethereum’s tally. Bitcoin rose 2% over the past 24 hours to $113,307 as of 3:10 a.m. ET Thursday, CoinGlass data showed. Ethereum was little changed, inching up 0.08% to $4,581. Ether has nonetheless staged a stronger recovery this week, climbing 5% from its Tuesday low, compared with bitcoin’s 2.8% gain over the same period. Since August 21, spot Ether ETFs have seen $1.83 billion in inflows, compared with just $171 million for spot bitcoin ETFs, data showed. Ethereum investor and educator Anthony Sassano described the trend as “brutal,” highlighting the scale of the shift. NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci noted that spot Ether ETFs are now nearing $10 billion in inflows since early July. Spot Ether ETFs, which have been trading for 13 months, have drawn $13.6 billion in cumulative inflows. Most of that activity has come in recent months. Spot bitcoin ETFs have a longer track record, with 20 months of trading and $54 billion in aggregate inflows. Momentum has recently tilted toward Ethereum, a trend some market participants linked to the passing of the GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation in July. With Ethereum holding the largest market share of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck called it “very much what I call the Wall Street token” in an interview with Fox Business this week. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that investment advisers account for $1.3 billion in exposure to Ether ETFs, citing SEC filings. Goldman Sachs was identified as the largest single holder, with $712 million in exposure.

Title: Steel tycoon Gupta's troubles deepen amid Australian probe

Australia's markets watchdog is said to have taken possession of a mobile phone belonging to Sanjeev Gupta as part of a deepening investigation into his operations, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Thursday 28 August 2025 09:46, UK Sanjeev Gupta, the metals tycoon whose main British business was forced into compulsory liquidation last week, is facing a deepening probe by Australian regulators into his operations in the country. Sky News has learnt that officials from the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) last week served Mr Gupta's Liberty Steel group with a new demand for information about its activities. Sources said the regulator had also taken possession of a mobile phone belonging to Mr Gupta as part of the probe. Money latest: Airline makes plus-sized travellers buy two seats One insider said that other senior executives at the company may also have had electronic devices confiscated, although the accuracy of this claim could not be verified on Thursday morning. Both ASIC and a spokesman for Mr Gupta's GFG conglomerate refused to comment on the suggestion that a search warrant had been produced by the watchdog. ASIC's deepening investigation comes a month after it said that three of GFG Alliance's companies had been ordered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales to lodge outstanding annual reports with it.

I also live at home with mum and dad' - The Gen Z landlords flipping the narrative It is the latest headache to hit Mr Gupta, whose companies remain under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. Last week, the Official Receiver took control of Speciality Steels UK following a winding-up petition from creditors led by Greensill Capital, the collapsed finance firm. Mr Gupta remains intent on buying SSUK back, and has assembled financing from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, Sky News revealed last week. SSUK employs nearly 1,500 people at steel plants in South Yorkshire, and makes highly engineered steel products for use in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and oil and gas. "[Gupta Family Group] will now continue to advance its bid for the business in collaboration with prospective debt and equity partners and will present its plan to the official receiver," Jeffrey Kabel, chief transformation officer, at Liberty Steel, said after SSUK's collapse. "GFG continues to believe it has the ideas, management expertise and commitment to lead SSUK into the future and attract major investment." "The plan that GFG presented to the court would have secured new investment in the UK steel industry, protecting jobs and establishing a sustainable operational platform under a new governance structure with independent oversight," Mr Kabel added. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free "Instead, liquidation will now impose prolonged uncertainty and significant costs on UK taxpayers for settlements and related expenses, despite the availability of a commercial solution." Mr Gupta wants to hand control of SSUK to his family in a bid to alleviate concerns about his influence. One source close to the situation claimed that the ownership structure devised by Mr Gupta would be independent, ring-fenced from him and have "robust standards of governance". Behind Tata Steel and British Steel, SSUK is the third-largest steel producer in the country. Other parts of Mr Gupta's empire have been showing signs of financial stress for years. Mr Gupta is said to have explored whether he could persuade the government to step in and support SSUK using the legislation enacted to take control of British Steel's operations. His overtures were dismissed by Whitehall officials. He had previously sought government aid during the pandemic but that plea was also rejected by ministers.

Title: ChatGPT’s Top 4 Cryptos to 100x for 2025

Time Published: 2025-08-28T07:08:39Z

If you were paying attention, you probably know the crypto market is up to something. Rapidly increasing corporate crypto stashes, a slew of pro-crypto policy changes, and the Fed chair hinting at a September rate cut are all massive signs that the next few months could churn out some life-changing returns. But in a market with hundreds of thousands of tokens, how do you identify the best cryptos to buy? Do you just stick to the main ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum? While relatively ‘safe,’ following this approach would probably mean leaving a lot of money on the table. On the other hand, you can’t just ape into random shitcoins either, hoping they skyrocket. That’s too risky and ill-advised. To help you do just that, we turned to ChatGPT, which is arguably the most powerful AI chatbot around right now. Read on as we unpack the AI’s top crypto picks, with detailed explanations on why each of them could be the next crypto to explode. If you’re a Bitcoin believer who would happily purchase every last bit of ‘digital gold’ they could, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might just be what you’re looking for. Not only is it far cheaper than $BTC, but $HYPER also carries a higher ROI potential, seeing as it’s currently in presale and available at ultra-low prices. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could surge almost 2,400% by the end of 2025, potentially hitting $0.32. What’s special about $HYPER? It’s building the first-ever Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aimed at turbocharging the blockchain with Solana-like performance. Thanks to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER will bring lightning-fast speeds, low fees, and cutting-edge Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. And a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge lets you interact with Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 environment by converting your Layer 1 $BTC into Layer 2 $BTC. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $12.4M from early investors. And right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.012815 apiece. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to join the Bitcoin revolution. Ethereum ($ETH) has been at the center of nearly all crypto chatter in recent days, and for good reason. Institutional players are scooping up ‘digital silver’ at a rapid pace, in some cases even favoring it over Bitcoin. That’s a telling sign the whales know something. Case in point: BlackRock recently dropped a massive $314M on Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street beefed up their $ETH ETF holdings by adding another 160K and 32.5K $ETH, respectively. Even better? If Ethereum retests its all-time high, $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated, igniting a massive short squeeze and fueling a potential parabolic rally. On the technical front, CryptoGoos, a crypto analyst with 121K+ followers on X, pointed out that $ETH has just broken out of a huge consolidation channel on the weekly chart. After a quick retest, the token now looks primed to rally higher. And according to this trading pattern, Ethereum’s next target could be… drumroll… $10K! Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) blends iconic meme coin humor with crypto finance, offering a never-before-seen community for retail investors. As a $WEPE holder, you gain access to a vibrant and tight-knit group of crypto traders, all benefitting from each other’s strategies, insights, alpha buy/sell calls, and, of course, plenty of jokes along the way. After a record-breaking presale performance, where $WEPE gathered over $70M from early investors, the token proved its worth by rising almost 900% during June-July this year. And while $WEPE is admittedly in the red over the past couple of weeks, it’s now flirting with the upper resistance of a major triangle consolidation pattern. A breakout here could slam the gas pedal and send $WEPE soaring, potentially even to new all-time highs, representing a 400% gain from current levels. In addition to strong technicals, the token is also set to benefit from its upcoming Solana launch, which is likely to bring in a fresh wave of investors and hype, further boosting price. Only a meme coin or a full-blown movement? We’ll let you decide. 1 $WEPE on $ETH is currently available at just $0.000067 on DEXs. Ir you want the new $SOL $WEPE, visit the visit Wall Street Pepe’s official website. Chainlink ($LINK) has long been considered one of the best tokens for diversifying crypto portfolios, but recent developments – both fundamental and technical – suggest it’s now ready to take the crypto space by storm. According to CryptoELITES, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst with more than 260K followers on X, $LINK is tantalizingly close to breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. Even better? The upward-sloping trendline of this pattern has acted as strong support for months, confirming this as a rock-solid setup that could deliver in a big way. The expectation? Once $LINK breaks out, ideally with a fat green candle, it could ignite an explosive rally on its way toward $100. That means if you scoop up $LINK now, while it’s trading around $24.16, you could be staring at a chunky 313% return on your investment. And here’s where things get even more exciting: major investment firms are showing interest in launching a spot Chainlink ETF, with Bitwise having filed for one just a few days ago. A spot ETF would legitimize $LINK as an institutional-grade asset, open the floodgates for new capital, and massively increase demand, all of which would be highly bullish for price. We decided to put ChatGPT’s potentially revolutionary research and narrative-building skills to the test by asking it to craft a well-rounded crypto portfolio for 2025. That said, kindly keep in mind that crypto investments are inherently risky. Also, this article is not financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: Firms urged to move staff onto workplace pensions ahead of December deadline
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/28/firms-urged-to-move-staff-onto-workplace-pensions-ahead-of-december-deadline/

Businesses planning to move staff on to their existing pension schemes to avoid being captured by the incoming automatic enrolment system are being urged to take action well before the new State-run portal goes live in December. Department of Finance officials have confirmed that auto-enrolment (AE) instructions will be issued in early December, targeting an estimated 800,000 workers in the Republic that are not currently part of a workplace or private pension plan. However, any cases where pension contributions have been made through payroll in the 13 weeks prior to that date will be exempt from the AE regime, which is called My Future Fund, they said. Many companies are known to be planning to move AE-eligible workers into their own existing defined contribution pension plans. “Companies intending to use their existing plan to achieve AE compliance, as many of them are, should get their ducks in a row well before the official January implementation date if they want to get their staff safely embedded with their own plans,” said Shane O’Farrell, director of workplace markets at Irish Life’s employer solutions unit. “Employers should aim to have the first pension contributions for newly enrolled staff by mid-November. This will avoid the risk that employees are enrolled into the State AE model by default, because they lack a history of pension contributions in their current employment.” There has been some concern among businesses that there would be little time to enter and cross-check details of workers being included in the AE scheme, as the online portal is only set to go live in December, according to sources. However, a spokeswoman for the department said that employers “will have a number of weeks” to use the AE portal and put in information, including preferred payment methods, before the official go-live date. “Employers will have a number of weeks to do this before go-live, giving ample time for them to ensure that they are able to meet their legal requirements and avoid the risk of fines, penalties and potential prosecution,” she said. [ How can I find what my likely State pension will be?Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, the department is planning to issue invitations to employers and representative groups “in the coming days” to an information event on the AE regime. “The event will be livestreamed and recorded to maximise outreach and will be supplemented by department-led webinars,” the spokeswoman said. The Irish Times first reported on Wednesday that former National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin has been selected to head up the agency that will oversee My Future Fund, the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa) – marking a major milestone in the project. It will be chaired by Roma Burke, an experienced actuary with extensive knowledge of the pensions industry. The introduction of the AE system has been the subject of a number of delays in recent years. The system is now set to start on January 1st. AE will apply to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 a year across one or more jobs and who are not already members of an occupational pension scheme. Employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the Government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in year 10. Under the auto-enrolment scheme, funds will be managed by three investment providers – Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and Blackrock. Indian information technology company Tata Consultancy Services was hired in 2024 to build and run the system. My Future Fund is expected to hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the Government.

Title: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) staking levels continue to break records, with the latest snapshot of the blockchain showing nearly 36.1 million ETH staked on the network – the highest level in history. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, close to one-third of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now staked. This high proportion suggests that ETH may be on the verge of a structural supply shock. The following chart shared by the analyst shows that even during sharp corrections in 2022 and 2023, staking levels continued to climb. Unlike speculative flows, which often exit the market during downturns, staking activity has proven “sticky” – with investors choosing to lock ETH into the network rather than liquidate. Staking ETH carries several key implications. First, it compresses supply – as more ETH is staked, less liquid supply remains on exchanges, creating a natural “supply shock” that amplifies demand-driven price moves. Similarly, it shows the priorities of investors. By staking ETH, investors essentially work as long-term participants. In this way, they align their incentives with network security and yield instead of short-term trading. ETH’s recent rally to $4,500 also coincided with record staking levels, creating a feedback loop – higher prices attracted institutional inflows from custodians, exchange-traded funds (ETG), and whales, while reduced liquid supply added further upward pressure. ETH ETFs now hold more than $300 billion in reserves, while asset managers such as BlackRock are actively accumulating. This underscores Ethereum’s transition from a speculative asset to a yield-bearing, institutionally supported infrastructure layer. U.S.-based spot ETH ETFs also enjoyed a long streak of positive inflows, lasting from the week ending May 16 through the week ending August 15. Commenting on this shift, XWIN Research Japan noted: Ethereum’s all-time-high staking levels reveal its underlying strength: while Bitcoin faces selling dominance in taker metrics, ETH is experiencing structural supply reduction. This divergence highlights Ethereum’s growing role not just as a crypto asset, but as the backbone of tokenization, DeFi, and RWA adoption. Similar sentiments were recently echoed by Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee noted that ETH is getting closer to becoming the backbone of global markets. That said, some risks remain. For instance, ETH price is still lagging despite ATH in daily network transactions. At the time, the analyst said that ETH was likely still in the accumulation phase. Similarly, the recent price pullback in ETH after creating a new ATH over $4,900 shows how recurring liquidation cycles are shaping ETH’s price action every week. At press time, ETH trades at $4,606, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Title: MicroStrategy Successfully Claims 3% Of Bitcoin Supply, Here’s How Much It’s Now Worth

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has achieved a milestone that cements its reputation as the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. A recent acquisition of 3,018 BTC on August 25 at a total purchase price of $357 million has pushed the company’s total Bitcoin portfolio to 632,457 BTC. Based on the current price of Bitcoin, the total value of the portfolio is valued at $46.502 billion. However, outside the value of its holdings, data shows that Strategy now controls over 3% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply. According to Strategy’s website, the American-based technology company now holds 632,457 BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has a total circulating supply of 19,912,106, although the maximum supply is hard capped at 21,000,000. In numbers alone, Strategy now owns 3.176% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin. Claiming such a large share of Bitcoin shows the scale of the company’s commitment and its strategy of positioning Bitcoin as the backbone of its corporate treasury. Owning more than 3% of Bitcoin’s supply has not only been symbolic but also financially rewarding for Strategy. In the current quarter alone, its portfolio has grown by 4.7%, generating $3.156 billion in gains. Since the start of 2025, the value of its holdings has increased by 25.4%, amounting to an increase of $12.641 billion in dollar terms. The company’s Bitcoin-based investment’s profit in 2025 has already surpassed the entire profit of $13.133 billion recorded in 2024. Notably, this Bitcoin buying strategy means the company’s performance is now linked to Bitcoin’s price movements, with every percentage increase in BTC translating into billions in added value. According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, Strategy is by far the biggest public Bitcoin treasury company. The second is America-based digital asset technology company MARA Holdings, which currently holds 60,639 BTC. Strategy is now part of the top five Bitcoin holders, behind crypto exchange Coinbase, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Spot Bitcoin ETF issuer BlackRock, which has seen the value of its Bitcoin holdings grow to over 747,000 BTC in August 2025. Interestingly, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio has even surpassed the total amount of BTC held in the Binance exchange reserve, which data from Coinglass currently puts at 578,903 BTC. Although holding over 3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is a milestone few companies could have imagined, Strategy’s ambitions are far from fulfilled. Co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor recently outlined a plan to raise $100 billion within the next four years to finance the company’s Bitcoin credit initiative. The financing could even reach up to $200 billion if the demand for the company’s securities is strong. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,300, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Cut welfare, give billions to Ukraine, suppress opposition: The German leader’s checklist to success

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory German chancellor Friedrich Merz has made a moderate media splash and ruffled some feathers in his own ruling coalition with the Centrist Social Democrats (SPD). Using the platform of a regional party congress of his CDU Conservatives in Niedersachsen, Merz has delivered a speech that immediately attracted national attention and will be remembered for one phrase. “The social [welfare] state, as we have it today,” the chancellor declared with appropriately dour mien, “can no longer be financed by what we are achieving economically.” Put differently, severe budget cuts on social issues are coming. And since that is a policy operative since, at the latest, 2003, there really isn’t so much left to cut. Merz is promising his people more of a bad time. His people. Not, however, the ultra-corrupt political anti-elite of Ukraine. Just before Merz’s claim that Germany cannot afford what it used to offer to Germans who pay for it, his government promised €9 billion ($10.4 bn) per year for Ukraine in 2025 and 2026, for now. That is on top of the €44 billion already sent that way. Germany is the “second-largest backer” of the Kiev regime in the world, as its obviously thoroughly detached finance minister Lars Klingbeil emphasizes with a perverse pride that must sound like a bad joke to many of his compatriots. Speaking of Klingbeil, in his Niedersachsen speech Merz also announced that he would “deliberately not make it easy” for his government colleagues from the SPD, who include, of course, Klingbeil. The SPD, of course, is well-known for being against harsh reductions in what Germans can expect from, in essence, old-age pensions, public health care, and the basic form of unemployment insurance now known as “Bürgergeld” (literally, “citizens’ money”). There is no reason to underestimate Merz’s genuine ideological commitment. It is true that, in general, he is unusually brutal about being dishonest even for a politician: Germany’s current leader has already proven that he is capable of breathtaking flipflops, staggering electoral bad faith, and underhanded maneuvering that violates the spirit of democracy if not the letter of the constitution. In the spring, his U-turn on public debt, to finance Germany’s new militarism on – exuberant – credit, was not only a massive breach of trust regarding especially his own conservative voters. Shamelessly exploiting a legal loophole, Merz also executed this radical reversal – many in his own party called it betrayal – by relying on parliamentary majorities that had already been cancelled by an election. Likewise, Merz’s coalition then proceeded to break promises regarding an energy tax relief as well as benefits for mothers. Germans are angry, but there is no sign that Merz and his government care. Consequently, according to a fresh poll by the reputable INSA institute, 62 percent of Germans are dissatisfied with their government. And yet, there is a hard core of authentic Merz, shaped by his own wealth, a very privileged life without material worries, and his long career as an overpaid member of the supervisory-board network nobility, at BlackRock and elsewhere: if there is one thing Germany’s leader is sincere about, it is his iron will to make the less well-off bleed more and work even harder, while making sure that those as materially comfortable and safe as himself get even richer. Call it neoliberalism with an unsmiling German face. Merz, of course, is also a very ordinary man, incapable of much self-reflection. He cannot honestly face any of the above. Instead he misunderstands himself as a savior of the fatherland, which he sees in need of much tough love and plenty of wholesome kicks up the backside to rediscover discipline, hard work, and competitiveness. The upshot of Merz’s blatant upper-class bias is, as a perspicacious German observer has put it, a de facto escalation of the ongoing re-distribution of income, wealth, and life chances – from those below to those above. Even now, 80 percent of the country’s taxes stem from income and value-added taxation. In other words: you work, you eat and keep a family going – be proud, you are also doing by far the most to pay the country’s bills. But Friedrich Merz, a millionaire who falls under “silver-spoon” rather than “self-made,” thinks it’s not yet enough. No wonder, then, that Merz’s recent speech in Niedersachsen has resonated. It was delivered in a sour as well as emphatic tone perhaps best described as schoolmasterly belligerence and featured much gratuitous no-compromise posing addressed probably more to his own doubting party and voters then his SPD coalition partners in Berlin. If Merz’s intention was to achieve a minor shock effect after Germany’s political summer break, he’s scored an ephemeral success. But his speech has also been misunderstood. In reality, its key message was something else and even worse. Yet another “business-friendly” – and business has also been very friendly to him – instinctive Western austeritarian telling his people they are having it too good and must lower their expectations? Not really news, is it? What was much more interesting was Merz’s reasoning. In his own words, the central political challenge is to prove that Germany “can be governed successfully from the center.” Or to be concrete, to keep down and out of power Germany’s two “populist” insurgent parties: from the right the very successful Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which tends to lead German opinion polls now, and, from the left, the currently marginalized – probably by foul play in the manner of, say, Romania or Moldova – but still threatening Bündnis Sarah Wagenknecht (BSW). Merz’s threat to go after what is left of the social welfare state in Germany comes with a promise of “reforms,” indeed a whole “autumn of reforms.” The purpose of this planned political offensive is clear: to persuade voters that they need not rely on those terrible “populists” to finally break out of the German doom loop of economic decline, demographic crisis, and pervasive malaise. Yet Merz’s strategy of what Germans call a “Befreiungsschlag” (a “deliverance strike”) smells of despair and is unlikely to succeed. Instead of an “autumn of reforms,” Germans are more likely to see their Winter of Discontent get even grimmer. Consider some basic data: We have just learned that Germany’s recession in the last quarter has been even worse than predicted: -0.3 instead of -0.1 percent. German industry is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands. In general, Germany’s economy remains heavily dependent on exports. It has stagnated for half a decade already and been in serious trouble much longer. In the EU+Britain, it is the most brutally affected by Trump’s ongoing and still escalating tariff war against Washington's vassals. Klingbeil admits that the budget will be €170 billion short by 2029 – despite dialing debt up to eleven. And all of that when the German ruling coalition only has what the Financial Times rightly calls a “razor-thin” parliamentary majority. Add that two of the most damaging strikes against the German economy have been self-inflicted: Sky-high energy prices, the direct result of shutting Germany off from (direct) Russian supplies – with the alleged help of a few Ukrainian divers and their US friends, of course – and subservience to the US. That subservience has only grown worse under both Merz and his equally hapless predecessor Olaf Scholz. Both have been bending over backward to please and appease America, just when its policies have become even more brutal: We are at a moment in “atlanticism” when a US treasury secretary openly announces that Washington sees its allies’ economies as its very own “sovereign wealth fund” at the disposal not of their governments or – perish the thought – citizens, but of the US president. And Merz and co. grin and nod and ask for more. The irony of it all is that while slavishly compliant with the US, Merz cannot learn the single biggest, most obvious lesson of its very recent political history, although it quite literally stares him in the face every time he visits the Oval Office to grovel: Donald Trump has become president against enormous resistance not once but twice because he led a “populist” challenge against a rotten establishment that Americans saw as unpatriotic. The future of Merz is not the success of Trump but the defeat and disgrace of Biden and everything he stood for. Germans, too, will demand a government that looks after German interests before it makes even more demands of them. Grotesquely, Merz thinks he is the savior of the old German establishment. He is its gravedigger. And in that sense, all power to his misguided arm!

Title: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Mihai Jacob, a well-known market watcher, says the Bitcoin price rally that followed Powell’s Friday speech may not be as strong as it first looked. The charts, he explains, continue to flash signs of weakness that should not be ignored. According to Jacob, the flagship cryptocurrency could still face another sharp decline, and a drop below $100,000 remains a real risk despite the short-term optimism. Jacob explains that in his earlier analysis, he noted the $110,000 zone as a key level for Bitcoin. As long as that level held, the broader bullish structure could technically stay intact. Powell’s speech gave a hint of a possible rate cut, and for a moment, the market reacted with excitement, and Bitcoin bounced just as traders wanted. But Jacob quickly asks the hard question: was that bounce real strength, or just wishful thinking? He advises trading what you see, not what you hope for. And what he sees now on the charts does not match the initial joy of the rally. Soon after the move, Bitcoin returned to the $ 112,000 support level, erasing most of the gains. For Jacob, this suggests that the market may have been reacting to temporary news rather than initiating a new wave of growth. He warns that the bounce looks more like a retest of broken levels than a fresh start to a bigger move. In other words, what seemed like a comeback may actually be a signal that Bitcoin remains weak. Instead of buyers taking control, the chart suggests sellers are still in charge, waiting to push the price lower again. Looking at the bigger picture, Jacob points out that Bitcoin still trades below the trendline that has been in place since April, highlighting the shape of the price action, which suggests a possible head-and-shoulders pattern is forming around the $110,000 zone. While not perfectly shaped, it is still enough to make cautious traders uneasy about what may come next. For Jacob, the excitement that came from Powell’s speech was likely nothing more than “rate cut euphoria,” and he believes the market is sending a very different message from what headlines suggest. The idea that Bitcoin would simply return to the same support level, giving late buyers another easy opportunity, is, in his view, hard to believe. More likely, it was a “dead cat bounce,” a short-lived move before another fall. Jacob makes it clear that his current stance is neutral in terms of active positions, but his outlook leans bearish. Optimism may be tempting, but he insists that discipline requires traders to trust the charts, not their hopes. With Bitcoin still struggling under key levels, he sees the possibility of a decline below $100,000 as very real.

Title: Why Bitcoin miners say times are ‘grim’ as fee drought poses existential threat to network
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-mining-suffers-grim-time-as-activity-craters/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:41:33Z

About us Copy link What was once a bustling network is quickly turning into a graveyard of onchain activity. Daily transaction fees on Bitcoin have plunged more than 80% since April 2024, according to an August 20 report from Galaxy Digital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners, the specialised computers that dedicate themselves to securing the network, are watching their revenue plummet as transaction fees dwindle. “It is grim for miners right now and there are no real catalysts on the horizon,” Nick Hansen, CEO of mining outlet Luxor, told DL News. “In fact, I’d say there’s mostly the opposite.” The collapse comes more than a year after Bitcoin’s 2024 halving slashed block rewards in half, leaving miners increasingly dependent on transaction fees that have largely disappeared. What’s draining the world’s largest blockchain of its activity? Ironically, it’s the arrival of what enthusiasts craved for a while: institutions. BlackRock and its ilk, which have accumulated more than 1.2 million Bitcoin through their exchange-traded funds, aren’t interested in actually using the network. Instead, they just want Bitcoin, buying over-the-counter, and then safeguarding on behalf of their assets. And while the buying has been torrential, it’s not been enough to lift transaction fees for the network or revenues for its miners. Other forces are also driving down margins for miners, including US President Donald Trump’s bellicose tariff regime, although none quite as powerful as Wall Street. While the Bitcoin industry has always been bound to catatonic lows and euphoric highs, to call the state of Bitcoin mining existential isn’t a stretch. When blocks don’t reach maximum capacity and activity dries up, miners lose the transaction fees that they need to offset operational costs, such as electricity, water, and upkeep. With block rewards already halved — and programmed to continue to halve — those fees are intended to be a lifeline. So far, that’s not panning out. For Bitcoin to have sustainable long-term economics, it needs a robust fee market that will eventually replace diminishing block rewards. That premise looks increasingly shaky as "paper Bitcoin" products take over and onchain activity withers. Nearly half of all Bitcoin blocks are “not full,” wrote Galaxy Digital, which means they are not reaching their maximum capacity. Moreover, about 15% of blocks are now processing transactions that are paying the lowest possible fee rate. “This is an existential problem to Bitcoin that I don’t see an obvious solution to in the short-to-mid term,” Hansen told DL News. The network’s mempool, once a bustling and competitive place where users bid up fees to get their transactions confirmed before others, now remains idle for hours at a time with hardly any activity. “Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has entered a lull,” wrote Will Owens, the author of Galaxy Digital’s report. When activity around Runes, Bitcoin’s take on memecoins, spiked last summer, speculative tokens accounted for 60% of daily volume. According to Owens, today it hovers at around 20%. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have swallowed 1.3 million coins worth a staggering $144 billion. For comparison, gold ETFs raked in $10 billion within three years of its launch in 2004. The problem is that every Bitcoin locked in an ETF is one less Bitcoin generating transaction fees. That’s because ETF providers package every transaction into one large tranche, settling the account at the end of the day, which results in a single transaction fee being paid. Bitcoin ETFs aren’t the only large players gobbling up coins. The top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold nearly 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $112 billion. Like Bitcoin funds, these treasury firms are also skipping transaction fees. Still, there’s hope. Hansen sees just one potential catalyst that could revive the fee market: actively managed Bitcoin treasuries. If companies like MicroStrategy — now known as Strategy — start actively trading their massive Bitcoin holdings rather than just hoarding, it could spark renewed on-chain activity. For Hansen, Bitcoin treasury companies are moving economic activity off-chain and keeping fees suppressed. “If [treasury companies] start being more actively managed, that could be a huge fee catalyst,” Hansen said. Until then, miners face a grim reality: Bitcoin’s success as an institutional asset has made the actual blockchain increasingly irrelevant.

Title: NZBA will vote to abandon membership model after industry exodus
URL: https://www.esgdive.com/news/nzba-will-vote-to-abandon-membership-model-after-US-canadian-European-banks-exit/758765/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T13:43:00Z

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After waves of exits by U.S., Canadian and European banks, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance said it would vote on forgoing a membership-based model and focus on establishing industry guidance. Following President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, large U.S. banks began an exodus from the United Nations-aligned Net-Zero Banking Alliance that expanded to U.S. asset managers before rippling beyond the nation’s borders. On Wednesday, NZBA announced its steering committee will hold a vote to reframe its mission and move away from a membership-based model, replacing it with a focus on establishing industry guidance. NZBA said in the announcement that it will pause all ongoing activities until the vote concludes and results are announced at the end of September, making it the second UN-backed net-zero industry organization to suspend activities this year. The banking climate alliance, backed by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative, was formed in 2021 with 43 members and at least tripled in size at one point, according to NZBA’s site. The organization’s website no longer contains a membership list or its signatory pledge; both links redirect to NZBA’s main webpage. Here’s a recap of how the organization got here. Even prior to Trump’s reelection in November, major U.S. banks and financial institutions had been subject to multiple Republican-led state probes and House Congressional investigations for being members of NZBA and other industry climate alliances. After the 2024 election, with Trump buoyed by Republican control of the House and Senate, six major U.S. banks — including five of the six largest U.S. banks — announced NZBA exits prior to the inauguration. Goldman Sachs was the first in December of last year, followed by Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup before the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase left the alliance in early January. All six banks had been targets of separate state probes by Republican state attorneys general and state heads of agriculture. Following the bank exits, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ended prior probes into Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. “Companies don’t want to step in the way of [Trump’s] agenda … they don’t want to jump in front of that freight train,” Arvin Vohra, CEO of energy-as-a-service provider Redaptive, told ESG Dive after the exodus of U.S. banks. Despite leaving NZBA, the banks have largely maintained their net-zero commitments and goals, with the exception of Wells Fargo — which dropped a 2050 net-zero financed emissions target in March. Another coalition of state attorneys general ended a probe into Wells Fargo shortly after the bank dropped its net-zero target. The U.S. defections were not contained to banks. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced it was exiting the UN-backed Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9, telling clients that the membership was creating confusion around the firm’s practices and making it subject to “legal inquiries from various public officials,” executives said in a reported letter. NZAM announced an operational pause shortly afterwards on Jan. 13, and Northern Trust Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management later left the climate alliance. The latter cited the pause as its reason for departing. Wall Street’s departure from NZBA first rippled north of the U.S. border to Canadian banks. Before the end of January, Canada’s six largest banks also announced their exits from NZBA. TD Bank, National Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce each announced their intent to depart on Jan. 20, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration in the U.S. Canada’s largest bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, departed Jan. 31. NZBA updated its guidelines for how banks should set climate targets in April, forgoing a prior requirement for members to strictly target limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The group’s updated guidance, instead, required signatories to align targets with limiting warming “to well below 2 [degrees Celsius], striving for 1.5°C.” On the same day the updated guidance was announced, Netherlands-based Triodos Bank exited the group and explicitly blamed the guidance’s lowered standards for its departure. The bank said in a release that the standards “fall short of the needed urgency to align loans and investments portfolios with the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming scenario.” Outside of Triodos’ exit, all of the prior departures had been tightly grouped in time and location around Trump’s election and inauguration. The exodus jumped across the pond in July, after U.K.-based HSBC said it was disassociating from the climate alliance and U.K.-based Barclays also quit the alliance. The departures hopped borders again in early August, when Swiss bank UBS withdrew from the alliance. “As we look ahead, NZBA remains focused on supporting the many committed banks driving this transformation forward,” an NZBA spokesperson told ESG Dive after UBS’ exit. “The need for bold action from the banking sector has never been greater and NZBA is here to help deliver it.” In announcing the vote to move away from a membership-based model, NZBA is addressing a point of contention that Republican state and federal officials have raised in recent years. The officials have alleged that members of NZBA, NZAM and other alliances like Climate Action 100+ have committed antitrust violations through pledges the groups require to orient asset and financed emissions towards net-zero emissions. NZBA said Wednesday it recognizes there is a “major opportunity for banks and key stakeholders to build on” its work and “encourages the banking sector to remain steadfast in implementing their net-zero commitments.” “The steering group believes this is the most appropriate model to continue supporting banks across the globe to remain resilient and accelerate the real economy transition in line with the Paris Agreement, as well as to continue engagement with the global banking industry to develop further guidance and tools needed to support them and their clients,” NZBA’s Aug. 27 update said. Katrin Ganswindt, coal and divestment campaigner for German-based environmental nonprofit Urgewald, had pointed criticism following Wednesday’s announcement and told ESG Dive that “voluntary alliances like NZBA did not deliver.” “Fossil fuel finance needs effective regulation, which would also improve the financial system's resilience,” Ganswindt said in an emailed statement. “Central banks, bank regulators and oversight agencies should finally step up to the plate. They should start by drawing a clear line at the financing of fossil fuel expansion.” Before NZBA announced the vote, Trillium Asset Management Director of Shareholder Advocacy Andrea Ranger told ESG Dive that whether the various departures were to avoid the legal risks of potential antitrust allegations by U.S. political entities, “the fact of the matter is that [NZBA] oriented these companies toward a net-zero strategy.” “Ultimately, what we really want [the banks] to do is actually do the work,” Ranger said in an interview last week. “Whether they’re part of an alliance or not — I think it would be better if there were that collective momentum versus each company doing their own thing — but we just want them to do the work. And if that helped them get there, then that's great.” YOU MUST AGREE TO OUR TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY. Already a subscriber? Sign in with your email above.

Title: Ethereum dominates despite ‘killer’ altcoins: ETFs boost ETH

Why is fresh institutional money flowing into ETH and not BTC? Ethereum surged as BlackRock accumulated $314 million and spot ETFs drew $455 million in inflows. Treasury firms added 3.56 million ETH, pushing it toward institutional adoption. Ethereum [ETH]’s momentum in the latter half of 2025 is proving hard to ignore. Beyond its record-breaking price surge, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is dominating the ETF arena and attracting deep-pocketed institutions. The latest signal came from BlackRock, which added nearly $315 million worth of ETH in recent transactions. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham revealed that BlackRock has quietly executed one of its largest Ethereum purchases yet, amassing $314.9 million worth of ETH across multiple transactions. The world’s top asset manager used ETF-linked wallets to scoop up Ethereum in tranches, with several 10,000 ETH transfers (worth around $46 million each) coming from Coinbase Prime hot wallets. Smaller frequent buys followed, such as a batch of 2,691 ETH. This accumulation isn’t happening in isolation. A new class of “Ethereum Treasury Firms,” publicly traded companies such as BitMine, SharpLink, and ETHZilla have also been adding ETH to their balance sheets. Collectively, these firms now hold over 3.7 million ETH, nearly 3% of the total supply. The timing of these purchases was critical. Ethereum traded at $4,578.88 at press time, up 3.3% in 24 hours and 9% on the week. Moreover, on the 26th of August, spot ETH ETFs posted $455 million of inflows, according to Farside Investors. Such momentum has fueled bullish forecasts, with Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine and Head of Research at Fundstrat, arguing that ETH remains undervalued and should be trading closer to $6,000. Even now, Solana [SOL], Avalanche [AVAX], Polygon [MATIC], Aptos [APT], and Sui [SUI] compete in niches such as gaming, high-speed transactions, and enterprise adoption. However, Ethereum has secured its dominance through Layer-2 scaling solutions and its role as the settlement layer of the ecosystem. As AMBCrypto previously noted, the outdated “Ethereum killer” label no longer applies. Instead, the industry is evolving into a multi-chain landscape where Ethereum remains the foundation while specialized chains thrive in parallel.
