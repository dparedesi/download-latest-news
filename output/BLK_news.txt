We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Health Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other buzzing AI health stocks. The economic impact of AI is projected to be substantial, particularly in regions like China and North America, which are expected to see GDP boosts of 26% and 14.5%, respectively, by 2030, amounting to $10.7 trillion combined. This surge is mirrored in the healthcare sector, where AI is driving transformative growth. According to SNS Insider, the Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Market, valued at USD 22.5 billion in 2023, is forecasted to reach a staggering USD 370.14 billion by 2032, expanding at an impressive CAGR of 36.5% from 2024 to 2032. This explosive growth underscores the growing role of AI in revolutionizing healthcare through innovations in diagnostics, treatment, and operational efficiency. The World Economic Forum also points out that AI's potential in healthcare is particularly promising, given the global shortage of healthcare professionals, projected to reach 10 million by 2030. AI can alleviate the strain by automating routine tasks, reducing physicians' administrative workloads, and enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This has sparked strong investment from both public and private sectors globally, making AI a key technology in the future of healthcare finance. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI's integration into healthcare is set to not only drive efficiency but also improve patient outcomes through more precise diagnostics and personalized treatment. Companies have responded by heavily investing in AI R&D, and mergers and acquisitions have accelerated the pace of innovation. As healthcare increasingly embraces AI, experts emphasize the potential for even greater transformations. According to Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI research, "AI will fundamentally shift the healthcare landscape, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing patient care while reducing costs." Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Our Methodology For this article, we selected trending health stocks that have AI products driving meaningful revenue gains. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An operating room with a doctor monitoring a patient's vital signs during surgery with a medical device. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) makes and sells healthcare products. The firm has embraced AI in diagnostics, particularly in its Alinity and FreeStyle Libre systems. The company uses AI to improve the accuracy of its continuous glucose monitoring systems and to enhance its diagnostics platforms. These AI-driven tools help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. In terms of financial performance, Abbott reported $43.1 billion in revenue for 2023, up 7% from $40.3 billion in 2022. The growth was primarily driven by increased demand for its AI-powered diagnostics tools, particularly in the diabetes care segment, where the FreeStyle Libre system saw a 12% increase in sales. Abbott's continuous investment in AI is expected to contribute to sustained revenue growth as demand for accurate diagnostics rises. Overall ABT ranks 4th on our list of the buzzing AI health stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Benetton the fashionable standard bearers of Italy’s rugby renaissance
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/05/benetton-the-fashionable-standard-bearers-of-italys-rugby-renaissance/
Time Published: 2024-10-05T05:00:00Z

Whisper it quietly, but Italian rugby genuinely appears to be on the up. Last season the Azzurri had its best Six Nations in terms of results, with two wins and a draw, and although their Under-20s were patchy, they won two Six Nations matches for the third campaign in a row, including a first ever win over their French counterparts. As usual Benetton were bulk suppliers to both, yet also had their best season since joining the Celtic League in 2010. Only twice in the ensuing 14 seasons have Benetton won more matches than they’ve lost, firstly in 2017-18 and again in 2018-19 when reaching the playoffs for the first time before losing 15-13 against Munster in Thomond Park. But by any metric, their achievement in finishing seventh in the URC last season was better, not only because they won a higher percentage of matches, 11 out of 18, with one draw, but because since the expansion to include the four South African Super Rugby powerhouses this is just a more competitive competition than in its previous iterations. What’s more, in securing automatic qualification on merit for this season’s Champions Cup, Benetton reached the quarter-finals of the URC and were pushing hard to force their quarter-final against the Bulls into extra-time before going down 30-23. There were also five more wins in their run to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup. “Yeah, for sure, it was a very good season,” agrees Antonio Pavanello, who was a back five forward for a decade with Benetton and has been their general manager since 2015. “We achieved the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup away to Gloucester, but unfortunately we didn’t play well. We were, perhaps, a little too nervous and that was a shame, but we also finished seventh in the URC and we achieved the quarter-finals, and in a stronger competition than the past. “So this quarter-final was at another level compared to 2019 and honestly we played a very good match. Everybody said we would be beaten well by the Bulls so we entered onto the field without stress and it was an opportunity to play good rugby.” Interestingly, while they scored five less tries last season compared to the season before (51 as against 56), Benetton were way more resolute defensively, conceding 18 fewer tries with 56 compared to 74 two seasons ago. “Calum MacRae, our defence coach, has done a very good job,” says Pavanello of the former Scottish Sevens player and head coach, who joined two seasons ago after five seasons as defence coach at Edinburgh. “So that is the result of the focus on that area. “He has done a very, very good job and on the other side we really improved in terms of physicality and so the improvement in that area is a result of the defence and winning more collisions. That was the main area we worked on and it was important to achieve those results.” Benetton also supplied 19 players to the Azzurri in last season’s Six Nations, and even if this obliges them to invest in imported talent to offset this drain Pavanello maintains: “If we help Italy to win matches in the Six Nations we are proud to have done our job well.” With acquisitions such as Malakai Fekitoa from Munster to further swell their non-Italian contingent, it seems that Benetton now have the financial resources and independence to target a high URC finish like never before, although Pavanello says this is also due to changing perceptions. “Our (financial) balance is getting better and better, and we can spend a little bit more money, but for me what we have now compared to previous seasons is credibility. “So, when I try to get new players, it is a little bit easier because in the past they see an Italian club without too many results so even if you offered them good money, they go to other clubs. “Now, it is a little bit different. We have more credibility and players are attracted to coming here, so if you offer the same money they prefer to come to a good environment, in a good city and a good country, and with a club that is looking to achieve new goals.” But for Pavanello, the sea change he has witnessed is as much off the pitch as on it. “When I finished my (playing) career here, there were seven people on the staff, now there are 25, so we can give to the players more and more detail. The facilities are much better than in the past. I can see a club that is on the same level as other clubs around Europe. So, Benetton aren’t of a mind to leave last season as a one-off, although there are half a dozen teams who missed out on the top eight last season and are genuinely targeting the playoffs this season. “Our ambition is to repeat the URC playoffs but we know that it will be harder because first of all everybody is waiting for us and we will be back in the Champions Cup and we know that competition is really, really hard,” admits Pavanello ahead of Benetton facing Clermont (away), Bath (home), Bristol (away) and La Rochelle (home). “In the meantime to have 20 players with Italy and five with Argentina, which is not easy to manage. The Italian players have the November internationals and the Six Nations, and as well as the Rugby Championship the Argentinian players have November internationals, and that is the main issue this season.” “But I am confident that the staff will find the right turnover in a large squad and we’ll have the opportunity to keep the energy at the right time with individuals players. “If I watch the model to copy it is the Irish system and especially Leinster. I always watch their model and try to apply the same things to our system in our club and for that reason we improve a lot in the last few seasons. “I think that Irish rugby is a good environment. The Irish team is very strong and Leinster is one of the best clubs in the world.” Unlike Leinster, of course, there is no schools rugby in Italy. Benetton do not have conveyor belts like Blackrock and St Michael’s. But Treviso is one of the small hotbeds of rugby in Italy. “Consider that around Treviso there are 17 clubs. We don’t have schools where you have the chance to play rugby, the private clubs do that, and we have 17 in this area. So, in terms of the identity of rugby (in Italy) this is the most important area. “We are talking about a province of one million people and in Treviso there are 800,000 so to have 17 rugby clubs around here is very important.” Benetton have an under-18 academy managed by the FIR which works with the best players in their region, and also an under-22 academy managed by the FIR. Ultimately though, however huge Gaelic football and hurling are in Ireland, rugby still commands attention and eyes, whereas Italian rugby is dwarfed by calcio and according to the former Zebre coach Michael Bradley, languishes in 16th place in participation numbers. Pavanello admits football’s dominance commercial “is a big problem for our sport in Italy”. “We try to work a lot in communication, especially on social media and we continue to work hard because we believe we can improve year by year.” Still, you can’t help but think that rugby globally could do more, be it have a World Cup in Italy or a Champions Cup final there. “That would be a good starting point to change the view in Italy but also in other countries. For example, in 2031 the World Cup will be in the USA. That is a good chance to develop rugby there, but I hope also that in the future we will have the chance to host a World Cup. “We have more than 60 million population here and if rugby can improve in one country that is Italy and you don’t do that only with the Six Nations. As you say, you have the chance to do this with events like the Champions Cup final or a URC final, as well as a Rugby World Cup final. That is the direction rugby should take.” Ultimately though, Pavanello remains optimistic about the future of rugby in Benetton and in Italy generally. “We know that we will have one season that you can have three steps forward and maybe one season that you can do only one step forward because of the opportunities we have financially. Inside the URC and the Six Nations we are not the most important club or union but I am optimistic because I see that the pathway is right.” Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Honest First 3 things to know this morning: 1. Stock futures rise on strong September jobs report2. Port union, U.S. Maritime Alliance reach tentative deal on wages3. Crude and Brent rose more than 9% each this week aloneWatch the live show here: https://t.co/tP0OT3stKc pic.twitter.com/DNWfd8h8ke Hold on I need to check X real quick... pic.twitter.com/ZC8cc7bY2L The yen is on pace for its worst day in 20 months after Japan’s new prime minister jolted currency markets by saying the economy isn’t ready for another rate hike https://t.co/bLXCDvus9P 글로벌 '매크로' 수익률이 세계 꼴찌 '한국 증시'의 추세 추종 수익률 보다 당연히 더 높습니다. ★'윤석열'★ 귀에 경을 읽는 시간이 돌아왔습니다. 장·단기 '커브전략'에서 금리·환율의 상관관계에 관한 '기본'공식은 명목금리(실질금리 + 예상 인플레이션율 ↑) - 예상(원자재 ↑ 가격 추이) 인플레이션율 = 실질금리, OO(유가, 비트코인, 금 등 대체 투자 상품) ↑ 금리 ↑ OO ↓ 입니다. Average Hourly Earnings in the US increased 4% over the last year, well above expectations for a 3.7% increase. The CPI Inflation Rate will likely fall to 2.3% in September, meaning a 1.7% positive spread of wage growth over price increases, the highest we've seen in years. pic.twitter.com/vqYMEPy6ia Elon Musk says he will attend Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania https://t.co/kWSaLwtd8n The yen posted its worst day since June 2022 after PM Shigeru Ishiba said the economy isn’t ready for another rate hike https://t.co/lkjprA3BYD 제가 쓰려고 길게 말해야 할 것을 '요약'해서 정리한 공식이라 용어가 어렵다면, 가장 쉬운 표현으로 "물가에 어떤 영향을 미칠까?"를 ★정치권, 선거판, 지정학★과 연관지어서 시나리오를 나눠보는 것입니다. 예제 1. "중동 긴장이 고조됐다."면 어디에 넣어보면 '될까요?' 원자재에 넣으면 되겠죠. 글로벌 경제는 '어떻게 될까'요? 실질금리는 어떻게 나올가요? 예상 '인플레이션율'에 넣으면 나옵니다. The U.S. economy added far more jobs than expected in September, pointing to a vital employment picture as the unemployment rate edged lower, the Labor Department reported Friday.Read more: https://t.co/aB0zMxAtfB pic.twitter.com/1b6L2xK7s3 Japanese stocks will likely rally after the yen suffered its biggest drop in more than two years on Shigeru Ishiba’s comment that the economy isn’t ready for another interest-rate hike https://t.co/po2FwbVx4x US job growth last month topped all estimates with the largest advance since March and the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined, quelling concerns of a marked deterioration in the labor market. https://t.co/LhZxdynf4O 예제 2. 78세의 역대 최고로 늙은 미국 대선후보 '도널드 트럼프' 핵심 관계자(측근) 이스라엘 '네타냐후'가 "레바논 공격을 '확대'했다."면 어디에 넣으면 될까요? '원자재'에 넣으면 되겠죠. 실질금리는 어떻게 나올까요? 예상 '인플레이션율'에 넣으면 나옵니다. 증권가·금융언론들의 어렵고 복잡한 경제 용어 대신 직관적이라 1초 컷이죠. Surprisingly strong hiring in September has taken pressure off the Federal Reserve by reducing worries over the US labor market https://t.co/ws9Nppglno US job growth blew past every estimate in September. But a good chunk of the surge may reflect how the government adjusts the numbers. https://t.co/4rFTAOFAV1 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee lauded the strong September jobs report but warned of putting too much stock in one month’s data, adding that there are risks that inflation might undershoot the central bank’s 2% target. https://t.co/Cc4UR7oOnK "야, 이거 왜 알아야 하니?" 정치권, 선거판, 지정학을 '살펴보면' 요즘처럼 유가가 상방이라는 확신이 설 수 있죠. 그러면 리스크 온(risk on)으로 '선물옵션' 걸면 '재미'를 볼 수 있습니다. 자, 그럼 주식, 부동산 이전에 뭐 부터 공부해야 할까요? 네, 그렇습니다. 바로 '채권'입니다. 채권을 알려면 뭘 열심히 공부해야죠? 네, 그렇습니다. '매크로'입니다. "야, 주식 수익률이 채권 수익률 보다 높다는데?" 어떤 사짜가 약파는 소리를 하죠? JPMorgan and Bank of America are now forecasting a quarter-point reduction in rates when the Fed next meets in November, giving up on their calls for a larger cut https://t.co/Yc8u9Tvl4M The Fed is likely to downsize its rate cuts to 25 basis points at both the November and December policy meetings, according to Nomura https://t.co/txJMfMCjx5 Competition is heating up for government bond traders with experience who can navigate volatile markets as the BOJ seeks to further raise rates, and Mizuho is looking internally for former dealers who can return to the trading floor https://t.co/7igZknF2dj 원유·'원자재' 선물 트레이딩만 해도 주식 수익률 보다 아득히 높습니다. 예제 3. 농업보다 연봉이 높으니까 미국 GDP의 70%(약 2/3)를 차지하는 소비 여력이 높아지니 장·단기 금리 '대장지표'라 불리는 '비농업' 고용지수가 "컨센서스를 '대폭 상회'하며 '급증'을 했다."면 어디에 대입하면 될까요? 예상 인플레이션율에 넣으면 나오죠. 실질금리가 상방이면 뭐가 상방일까요? Traders are paring bets for a BOJ rate cut in December after the PM's remarks https://t.co/vPMeqBmVqA The Bank of Japan will keep seeking the best timing to raise interest rates again as economic conditions continue to improve, according to former BOJ board member https://t.co/fckXSzTDNz A surge in hiring offers Vice President Kamala Harris a fresh defense in her fight with Donald Trump over the economy, as the pair jockey to frame their visions in the home stretch of the campaign. https://t.co/8gDrGujeaU 네, '그렇습니다'. '달러'입니다. 다시, '미국'이 '고용을 아무리 '늘려도' 경기침체가 올까요? 안 올까요? 그럼 뭐가 또 문제가 되죠? '인플레이션'율이죠. 그래서 '윤석열'한테 "미국 경제 망했다"면서 노동자로 '시비' 붙지 말라고 한 것입니다. 왜? 인플레이션이 '다시 튀면' 금리 올리거나 higher for longer인데 그 피해는 누가 볼까요? 특히 환율에 취약한 '한국'입니다. US stocks closed solidly higher on Friday, as a stronger-than-expected jobs report reassured investors who had worried the economy may be slowing too rapidly https://t.co/kQojjcrpX6 pic.twitter.com/aVCFowKL5g Maps show voter registration options and deadlines for 2024 election https://t.co/rsthGo5Liu Israel may not be able to take down Iran's nuclear sites on its own https://t.co/2jUu1Z1CPt "야, 채권 수익률이 오르면 '매도'아니냐?" 예제 4. 외우지 좀 말고, 고용이 증가하면 뭐가 늘어나죠? 소비가 늘어나죠. "고용이 '깜짝' 증가를 했다."면 어디에 넣어보면 될까요? 인플레이션율이죠. '미 국채' 채권 금리(채권 수익률)는 '어떻게 될까'요? "그거 알아서 뭐 하는데?" 돈이니까. 1억 원을 투자하면 '1bp' = 0.01%당 60만 원의 손익을 볼 수 있습니다. 순식간에 통장에 몇억 원이 꽂히거나 삭제가 될 정도라 리스크 온(risk on)에 확신이 서야만 합니다. It was so much worse than you remember pic.twitter.com/lEOrfzQ8QE This, from Jack Smith's filing explaining why Trump's alleged criminal conduct in attempting to overturn the 2020 election is not immunized from prosecution, perfectly captures what Trump did. pic.twitter.com/xRN7T8hmAw Former President Donald Trump "resorted to crimes" to attempt to stay in office after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, federal prosecutors allege in a newly unsealed court filing released Wednesday.In the filing submitted by special counsel Jack Smith,… pic.twitter.com/lr2ut8tFn2 예제 5. 요즘 제가 계속 말했던 게 'LNG 가스'죠. 왜? 특히 유럽이 '러시아' 의존도가 높은데 곧 겨울철이라 소비가 늘어날 것입니다. 그럼 LNG 가격이 오를까요? 내릴까요? 가스를 못 쓰면 뭘 써야죠? 산에가서 장작을 패올까요? 연탄이라도 태울려고? 유럽인들이 '그럴 리가' 없죠. '전기' 쓸 겁니다. 그런데 ★"미국 LNG '재고량'이 예상보다 '적다'"★면 미국인들이라고 산에가서 장작을 패올까요? 연탄을 태울까요? 그럼 어디에 넣으면 되죠? 인플레이션율입니다. The US Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity should not prevent Donald Trump from standing trial for his “private crimes” in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to US prosecutors’ newly unsealed filing https://t.co/5pnGCvDriR pic.twitter.com/BuZbNliLk4 Trump fired his attorneys after the 2020 election and replaced them with Rudy Giuliani because he would be willing to “spread knowingly false claims of election fraud,” Special Counsel Jack Smith alleged in a wide-ranging filing.https://t.co/o9kJADnABe pic.twitter.com/Hbn152QMGc After losing the 2020 election Donald Trump told his family: “It doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.”While rioters on January 6th threatened Vice President Pence at the Capitol, Trump said “so what?”165-pages of damning evidence. https://t.co/59DW36qYQ8 예제 6. "'펜딩 주택'(Pending Home Sales) 잠정 판매량이 역대 최저 수준을 벗어나지 못하고 있다."면 무슨 생각이 들죠? 주거비 생각 안 나나요? '주거비'는 CPI의 35%(1/3)를 차지합니다. 예제 7. "허리케인 '영향'으로 실업수당 청구 건수가 '증가'했다."면? 8월부터 12월까지 '허리케인' 시즌이 미국 정치권과 선거판에 어떤 영향을 줄 건지 좀 봐야죠. A judge sentenced Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk, to nine years behind bars for leading a voting system data-breach scheme inspired by the rampant false claims that fraud altered the 2020 presidential outcome. https://t.co/wDdNvrtulj Donald Trump is publicly praising Georgia Governor Brian Kemp after years of blaming him for his 2020 election loss https://t.co/Hzrjoxdt7m On January 6, Donald Trump incited an attack on our nation’s democracy because he didn’t like the outcome of the election. Armed with weapons and animated by Trump’s lies, insurrectionists invaded the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn a lawful election.The January… pic.twitter.com/hrqD3ptm7k 이제 왜 '윤석열' 일당들이 '엉터리' 경제 이론으로 "미국 경제가 망했다."는 '샴의 법칙'이 안 맞는지 설명이 될 것입니다. '샴의 법칙'은 최근 3개월 실업률 이동평균이 직전 1년 실업률의 3개월 이동평균 최저점보다 0.5%p높으면 경기침체가 시작된다는 법칙입니다. A judge ripped into a former Colorado county clerk for her crimes and lies before sentencing her Thursday to nine years behind bars for a data-breach scheme spawned from the rampant false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.https://t.co/x3XJwoMHOT 'With All Due Respect, He Is Lying': Abby Phillip Clashes with Republican Over Bogus Trump Claim https://t.co/8tsJFzjEbf In the wake of Hurricane Helene, we are seeing the best of America. Neighbors are taking care of each other. People are delivering supplies to folks in need.Thank you to everyone who has risen to this moment and stepped in to help. We will rebuild and recover together. pic.twitter.com/CA2TmRaqft '한국' 따위야 망하거나 말거나 '달러 찍어'서 민간·공무원 고용 늘리면 되는데? 기축통화국이 불만이면 달러 대신 '위안화 투자' 하던가? 인플레이션이 소비에 영향을 줄 것 같으면 금리인상하면 그만이고, 그냥 higher for longer로 바짝 말려도 그만이죠. 왜? 미국 GDP 70%(2/3)가 소비인데 달러-원 환율이 오르면 '한국'에서 수입 비용이 감소합니다. 이거 없는 얘기냐? 아닌데? '중국'에 '나왔던 얘기'죠. Kamala Harris is visiting Michigan, seeking to shore up support from traditional pillars of the Democratic base - including union workers, firefighters, and Arab American voters https://t.co/CPGiDRp7cq Two building crises — a massive hurricane cleanup and an intensifying conflict in the Middle East — could yet reshape the presidential race just weeks before Election Day https://t.co/YzNrcI4sle As president, I will fight for every American—no matter how they vote. Don’t miss my rally in Flint, MI. Watch now. https://t.co/eqzNORVftj 지정학(지리경제학) 얘기 안 하려다, 전쟁 왜 할까요? "야, 심심하니 전쟁하자." 뭐 이러나요? 그게 다 돈인데? 그렇지 않습니다. 역사적으로 전쟁이 벌어지는 이유는 돈과 권력이었습니다. 뭔 소리하는 줄 못 알아 듣겠다면, 징기스칸으로 알려진 몽골 유목민을 예로 생각해보면 쉽게 이해가 될 것인데요. Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are facing off Tuesday night in the first and only vice presidential debate of the cycle, as the two candidates look to prop up the Republican and Democratic tickets.Here's what to know about both candidates' views and policy record. pic.twitter.com/mIprxgWIKG Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act—gutting access to life saving care for 45 million Americans, like Tina—with no plan to replace it.As president, I will continue fighting to make health care more affordable for middle class families. pic.twitter.com/WZK7VeW2cq Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) went into the vice-presidential debate with a plan to surprise Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz by being shockingly ... super-duper nice. https://t.co/yUlBmaQgIY 몽골 유목민들은 농사를 짓지 않습니다. 왜? 다른 종족, 국가의 경작지를 약탈한 후 약탈이 끝나면 다른 '농경 지대'를 약탈하니 농사를 지을 필요가 없었고 농업 인력에 들어갈 비용도 노예(군수물자 지원계)로 충당할 수 있습니다. 모든 '인구'를 군사력에 집중하면 되니 인류 역사상 가장 영토가 넓었던 몽골 제국이 탄생했던 것이죠. Minnesota-based Vista Outdoor has agreed to sell its sporting goods and ammunition units for a total of $3.35 billion https://t.co/fEwDKsuMVj Megyn Kelly says Kamala Harris message ’working’: ’She’s somehow getting through’ https://t.co/WeoQ3Dxmur The blockbuster jobs report just gave Kamala Harris a boost where she needs it most https://t.co/lEfFVwVWiI 예제 8. "ISM '비제조업' PMI가 예상치를 상회했다.", "S&P Global '서비스' PMI 소폭 하락했지만 여전히 예상치를 상회했다."면 무슨 생각이 드나요? 서비스 부문이 18개월 만에 '최고치'를 기록했는데, "8월 '공장 주문'이 예상치를 '하회'하며 감소했다."면 무슨 생각이 드나요? 미국 경제가 망했다? 아니라니까? The ever-resilient US economy is once again causing havoc for Wall Street worrywarts, who have sounded the recession alarm all year https://t.co/R4XW8b9fzM The steady march of robots into factories isn't diabolical but pragmatic: companies will spend on automation when it makes sense and when it doesn't, they won't. https://t.co/8y0IrnaXfw 첫째, 미국 제조업에 '슈퍼 코어' 인플레이션이 미치는 영향이 어떤지 생각 안 들까요? 둘째, 미국 공장 주문이 감소했다면, 왜 감소할까요? 글로벌 경기침체죠. 왜? 글로벌 경기가 안 좋으니까 안 팔리니 주문이 감소하지 않았을까요? 둘째, 중국 제품이 더 팔렸기 때문일 수도 있겠죠. 이게 무역 분쟁이자 세계 패권 경쟁이라고 말한 新냉전시대입니다.

Global food prices saw the largest jump in 2.5 years in September, with sugar prices leading an across-the-board increase for commodities including wheat and edible oil https://t.co/J0XtoRDh9n Bloomberg’s Trade Tracker shows 2 out of 10 key measures of global commerce in “below normal” territory, while 8 are in “normal” zone https://t.co/bmEhTNGM3b pic.twitter.com/X300VtYWvP President Joe Biden touted his jobs record during a White House press briefing. He says the has created 16 million jobs since taking office, but says there's more work to do to lower costs for Americans https://t.co/EMQCwuJNfw pic.twitter.com/zjIKteD6I2 무슨 생각 들죠? 2분기 GDP 성장률 -0.2% 역성장을 내놓고 초부자(super rich) 감세라 불리는 법인세 인하로 세수를 30조 원 펑크를 내놓은 '윤석열' 생각이 '안 드나'요? '윤석열'이 하던 소리 아닌가요? 2분기 연율 '2%' 성장한 일본은 소비(내수)에서 나오는 서비스 부문 성장이 둔화(침체)되고 있고, 'IMF'는 인플레이션에 맞춘 금리인상을 조언했습니다. "야, 소비(내수) 안 된다며?"

Title: Wall Street gains as US jobs data eases economic worries

US stocks have closed higher as investors digested a labour report that indicated unemployment slipped last month. Photo / 123RF The Dow has posted a record closing high and the Nasdaq ended with a more than a 1% gain as a stronger-than-expected jobs report reassured investors who had worried the economy may be getting too weak. US job gains increased in September by the most in six months and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, the report showed. The data “basically tells us economic activity in the fourth quarter is likely to remain at a solid pace,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It’s a good surprise but I also think it may now slow the pace of rate cuts.” Traders further reduced bets on a 50-basis-point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s November 6-7 meeting. Traders are pricing in just an 8% chance of a 50-bps rate cut, down from about 31% earlier on Friday, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed. The Fed kicked off a monetary easing cycle last month with a 50 basis point rate cut. Small caps and financials outperformed, with the Russell 2000 index up 1.5% and the S&P 500 financials index up 1.6%. Spirit Airlines shares dropped 24.6% while other airlines jumped after a report showed Spirit was in talks with bondholders about a potential bankruptcy filing. Frontier Group shot up 16.4% while United Airlines rose 6.5% and Delta Air Lines climbed 3.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341.16 points, or 0.81%, to 42,352.75, the S&P 500 gained 51.13 points, or 0.90%, to 5751.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 219.37 points, or 1.22%, to 18,137.85. Indices registered just slight gains for the week following worries about increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Dow was up 0.1% while the S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq was up 0.1%. The S&P energy index rose 1.1% on the day along with higher oil prices. With the Middle East concerns, the index jumped 7.0% for the week in its biggest weekly percentage gain since October 2022. US President Joe Biden said that if he were in Israel’s shoes, he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran’s missile barrage this week. Rivian shares fell 3.2% after the electric vehicle startup cut its full-year production forecast and delivered fewer vehicles than expected in the third quarter. Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to unofficially begin next week. Major financial firms highlight next week’s reports, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and BlackRock due on October 11. Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20.6% for the year so far. US ports on the east and Gulf coasts reopened but clearing the cargo backlog will likely take time. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 91 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 10.91 billion shares compared with the 12.03 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Fast-track bill aims to give swift approval to major projects of national significance.

Rachel Lord, Head of International for BlackRock said, ““We are excited by the opportunity to deliver affordable and innovative investment solutions to millions of people in India. With our partner Jio Financial Services, we want to contribute to the country’s evolution from a nation of savers to a nation of investors. Investing is the way for people to reach their financial goals more quickly, and to accelerate wealth creation.” Jio and BlackRock had announced setting up a JV for asset management business in India in July 2023. In October 2023, Jio Financial and BlackRock Management filed papers for their mutual fund with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). BlackRock Asset Managers is one of the world’s largest asset managers. It previously operated in India in a JV with the DSP Group through DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund. The partnership ended in 2018, following which BlackRock announced its plans to re-enter India with Jio Financial. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: 1600 jobs slashed as ‘green revolution’ stalls at Northvolt

Time Published: 2024-10-05T00:54:08Z
Full Content:
A major company was supposed to spark a “green revolution” and wean the world off oil and Chinese imports, but it is not going to plan. Things can change an awful lot in just three years. Back in 2021, the opening of a giga factory in an icy city near the Arctic Circle was hailed as the starting point of a “green industrial revolution” that would change the world. The factory was opened by an exciting and rapidly-expanding business called Northvolt that had a mission to build “the world’s greenest battery” to power electric vehicles. Sweden’s then prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said the opening of Northvolt’s base in Skelleftea held huge significance in the transition away from oil and imported batteries from China — not just for Europe, but for the world. His optimism did not seem misplaced at the time. Northvolt had attracted billions of dollars of investment from Wall St giants like Goldman Sachs and Blackrock and orders from the world’s biggest car companies including Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo. But, in more recent times a far more sobering reality has emerged. Last week, the beleaguered electric car battery maker revealed it would cut a quarter of its staff, as it struggles with strained finances and a slowdown in demand. The brutal cuts in Sweden come as electric car sales slump in Europe and the continent lags far behind China in battery production. The company employs 6,500 people, according to its website. A staggering 1,600 of those will lose their jobs. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s boss, has blamed “headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate” for the difficult decisions. “While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time,” he said in a statement. He added that Northvolt needed to “focus all energy and investments into our core business.” It comes as global car companies, including Northvolt’s biggest investor, Volkswagen, have had a tough time selling EVs, with some posting losses from their electric divisions. A major problem for Northvolt is that as demand for EVs has softened, the demand for the cells that power them has followed suit. Even the most well-established battery-makers like South Korea’s SK On and LG Energy Solution have seen profits take a big hit — and the Swedish company has fared even worse. Northvolt lost $1.74 billion last year — that’s four times its loss in 2022. Calls to rethink petrol-powered car ban timeline Northvolt’s problems could become even more concerning given the bleak situation for the European EV market right now. Last week, the European auto industry called for “urgent relief measures” as electric car sales plummet in the region. It said there was a “continual downward trajectory” in EV sales. New-car registration data reveals European electric vehicle sales fell 45 per cent in August 2024 with 92,627 sales, compared to 165,204 at the same time in 2023, while the market share for battery-electric vehicles has fallen from 21 per cent to 14.4 per cent. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said the fall was driven by Germany and France, the largest new-car markets in the European Union. In Germany, electric vehicle sales dropped a massive 68.8 per cent in August compared to the same time in 2023, while France dropped 33.1 per cent. The situation is so dire that the ACEA called on the EU to rethink its timeline for banning petrol-powered cars — currently slated for 2035. It said while carmakers have supported the transition to electrified vehicles, “the other necessary elements of this systemic shift are not in place”. “We are missing crucial conditions to reach the necessary boost in production and adoption of zero-emission vehicles: charging and hydrogen refilling infrastructure, as well as a competitive manufacturing environment, affordable green energy, purchase and tax incentives, and a secure supply of raw materials, hydrogen and batteries,” said the ACEA board. “Economic growth, consumer acceptance, and trust in infrastructure have not developed sufficiently either.” Self-inflicted pain Although the market is faltering, Northvolt’s biggest issue is self-inflicted according to The Economist. It reported the company had a pot of funding worth $22 billion last year which it spent “far and wide” in projects like developing a sodium-ion cell battery and working on wood-based batteries with a paper company. Northvolt said it was spending on average $434 million a month with the aim of becoming a vertically integrated European battery giant with intensive manufacturing sites in Canada, Germany, Poland and Sweden. However, it lost sight of its core money-making purpose of making EV batteries on time for its big clients like BMW — which spectacularly pulled the plug on a $3 billion order of cells in May because of delays. Major job cuts Northvolt, which previously warned that cuts were coming, said that following “initial steps” of a strategic review it estimated that proposed cost-saving measures would result in about 1,000 redundancies at its primary Skelleftea plant — where an expansion project would be suspended. The company had intended to expand the capacity of the facility to provide an annual output of 30 GWh, but will now focus on ramping up to 16 GWh. In July, it said it hoped to reach an annual production of over one GWh this year — still far from the facility’s capacity. One GWh is enough to equip 20,000 average sized cars. “Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations,” Carlsson said in a statement. Another 400 positions would be cut in the city of Vasteras and 200 in the Swedish capital Stockholm. “The rescoping of operations is critical to ensure a sustainable operation and cost base,” Northvolt said. It added that “to achieve this a workforce reduction of approximately 20 per cent at a global level, and 25 per cent in Sweden is required”. Falling behind to China Northvolt has been seen as a cornerstone of European attempts to catch up with China and the United States in the production of battery cells, a crucial component of lower-emission cars. Europe accounts for just three per cent of global battery cell production, but has set its sights on 25 per cent of the market by the end of the decade. Northvolt still reports to have contracts worth $80 billion with customers such as Scania, Volvo and Volkswagen. Volkswagen is also Northvolt’s largest shareholder, with a 21 per cent stake. Production delays and lower demand from automotive customers have led to a rapidly deteriorating financial situation, which accelerated at the end of the summer, according to the business daily Dagens Industri. According to Swedish media reports, Northvolt is trying to organise a new share issue to raise 7.5 billion kronor ($1 billion). The battery maker has also faced scrutiny in Sweden over concerns about work safety at its sites, with Swedish police currently investigating a number of unexplained deaths of factory workers, who died after working at the plant in Skelleftea. In mid-September, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that “there are no plans for the Swedish state to become a part owner of Northvolt or anything like that”. Since its creation, the Swedish company has secured $22 billion of credit and capital. As it looks out on a rocky landscape, it will have to choose how to spend that money very wisely. — with AFP To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

He also noted the stocks rally on Friday as Wall Street celebrated better-than-expected job creation last month. "A market that appreciates good news, like a robust job creation number, is a market that can handle, well, let's just say, the historically tough month of October," he said. "After today's performance, all I can say is so far so good." Tuesday brings earnings from PepsiCo and an investor day from General Motors. Cramer noted that there have been some price target cuts for the beverage company, but suggested that the stock could "stabilize on somewhat in-line results." Meanwhile, General Motors stock could go higher if the company maintains its forecast, according to Cramer, adding that it has had a solid year. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will release notes from its most recent meeting, and Cramer said they could shed light on the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points. Wall Street, he said, continues to speculate about the Federal Reserve's next move, adding that opinions are mixed, especially after Friday's strong labor data. The labor department will release September's CPI report on Thursday, and Cramer said investors who want a rate cut are hoping for a cool number. Thursday also brings earnings from Domino's and Delta. The pizza maker's last quarter was disappointing in part due to weak business overseas, Cramer said, adding that analysts are mixed about how this report will shake out. And while Cramer said he's wary of airline stocks, he suspects Delta will tell "a good story." Cramer pointed to three Big Tech events on Thursday: Tesla will unveil its robotaxi, and both AMD and HP Enterprise will hold analyst days. He anticipates Tesla's autonomous vehicles will be well-received by investors. AMD's "Advancing AI" event could show the company in a new light, Cramer said, and he suggested the stock is a buy ahead of the meeting. HP's analyst day could be "a needle-mover," according to Cramer, as it's centered around its artificial intelligence efforts — which he said are "substantial and underestimated." Friday brings the producer price index report, and like the CPI, this data will be a metric for the Fed's next decision, Cramer said. Big ticket financial earnings will also come out that day, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Blackrock. He said banks represent the least expensive group on the market, and investors should use any weakness to buy them.

Title: AI’s energy appetite too big for Texas grid, regulators warn

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/04/2024 3:45:57 PM PDT by nickcarraway Datacenters coming online in the next 15 months will need to supply at least some of their own powerUpdated As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas, but as datacenter footprints explode amid the AI boom, regulators fear even the Lone Star state's utilities won't be able to keep up for much longer. The Texas' Public Utility Commission is now warning datacenter operators looking to set up shop in the US state within the next 12 to 15 months that they won't be able to rely entirely on the local grid and will have to supply at least some of their own power. As some of you will know, Texas has at times suffered blackouts from demand overload, and outages sparked by storms damaging infrastructure. "We can't afford to lose any of our resources off the system at this point, especially given those load-growth projections," Thomas Gleeson, who chairs the commission, told Blomberg during the Gulf Coast Power Association conference in Austin this week. Chief among Gleeson's concerns is datacenters setting up shop near existing power plants and buying up the supply of electricity, making it harder for the grid to keep the lights on for everyone else. Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

Create 1,000 images with a model like Stable Diffusion XL, and you’ve produced as much carbon dioxide as driving just over four miles in a gas-powered car, according to the researchers Melissa spoke to.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Updated As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas, but as datacenter footprints explode amid the AI boom, regulators fear even the Lone Star state's utilities won't be able to keep up for much longer. The Texas' Public Utility Commission is now warning datacenter operators looking to set up shop in the US state within the next 12 to 15 months that they won't be able to rely entirely on the local grid and will have to supply at least some of their own power. As some of you will know, Texas has at times suffered blackouts from demand overload, and outages sparked by storms damaging infrastructure. "We can't afford to lose any of our resources off the system at this point, especially given those load-growth projections," Thomas Gleeson, who chairs the commission, told Blomberg during the Gulf Coast Power Association conference in Austin this week. Chief among Gleeson's concerns is datacenters setting up shop near existing power plants and buying up the supply of electricity, making it harder for the grid to keep the lights on for everyone else. Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

Chief among Gleeson's concerns is datacenters setting up shop near existing power plants and buying up the supply of electricity, making it harder for the grid to keep the lights on for everyone else. Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online.

During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

Time Published: 2024-10-04T20:34:40Z
Full Content:
In a recent transaction, Christopher Accettella, Portfolio Manager at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), has made a notable purchase of the company's common stock. On January 11, 2024, Accettella acquired 1,190 shares at a price of $15.17 per share, amounting to a total investment of $18,052. This transaction reflects the Portfolio Manager's growing stake in the company, bringing Accettella's total holdings to 4,069.502 shares following the purchase. The acquisition, which took place directly, showcases a vote of confidence in the trust's future performance. Investors often monitor insider transactions such as these for insights into the perspectives of key executives and managers regarding their company's stock. Accettella's decision to increase his investment in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is likely to be interpreted as a positive signal about the company's prospects. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, trading under the ticker NYSE:BMEZ, is known for its focus on health sciences and related sectors. The trust's performance and the actions of its insiders are closely watched by investors interested in the healthcare investment space. The details of this transaction were made public through a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which documents the insider trading activities of the company's executives and other significant shareholders. Christopher Accettella's recent purchase of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) shares aligns with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, BMEZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.4%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BMEZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." The trust's market capitalization stands at $1.69 billion, with a P/E ratio of 25.31, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for its earnings. This valuation comes despite another InvestingPro Tip suggesting that BMEZ "suffers from weak gross profit margins." Investors should weigh these factors against the trust's impressive total return performance, which shows a 24.93% gain over the past year and a 15.87% return year-to-date. It's worth noting that BMEZ is currently trading at 95.72% of its 52-week high, with a previous closing price of $15.76. This proximity to its peak price could be influencing insider buying decisions, such as Accettella's recent purchase. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics that could provide further context to the trust's financial health and market position.

Dubbed the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF, the fund’s strategy entails periodically shifting exposure between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts and assets like U.S. Treasuries. Those changes are motivated by “a proprietary signal,” the firm said, which looks at several moving averages for cryptocurrency prices. The new fund will combine the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). The slated conversion follows Bitwise’s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF space alongside financial titans like BlackRock and Fidelity in January, following SEC approval. Currently, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF holds nearly 39,000 Bitcoin worth $2.3 billion, according to CoinGlass data. The fund takes a momentum-based approach toward investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. When Bitwise’s signal indicates that “prices are gaining momentum,” the fund gains crypto exposure, while seeking refuge in government debt when the opposite trend emerges. “Momentum is a well-established factor in virtually every asset class, and it is powerful in crypto as well,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said in a press release, adding that the new fund’s goal is to “help minimize downside volatility and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns.” Following the launch of its spot Ethereum ETF in July, Bitwise has continued to position itself as a purveyor of funds giving investors access to crypto through traditional brokerage accounts. Earlier this week, Bitwise filed an industry-first application for a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. The first futures-based crypto ETF was approved three years ago, when regulators gave ProShares’ Bitcoin Trust a green light. Since the launch of spot-based alternatives, however, several asset managers have recalibrated futures-based offerings. VanEck said last month, for example, that it would liquidate its futures investment product for Ethereum. The firm cited investor interest and liquidity as factors for determining the move. Bitwise’s new fund is set to charge investors a 0.85% fee ratio, and its prospectus makes clear that it does not invest directly in digital assets. Because the fund can rotate its exposure into U.S. Treasuries completely, Bitwise said “there will be periods—and perhaps extended periods—when the Fund has no exposure to Bitcoin futures contracts” at all. While Bitwise lists its three funds’ “limited operating history” as a potential risk, Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said in a statement that the company is breaking new ground with the product. “At Bitwise, we believe there are many different ways in which investors will want to gain access to this new and emerging asset class,” he said. “We’re excited to introduce new groundbreaking strategies for these three ETFs to give investors more options for accessing the market.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Crunchboard Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Fusion startups have raised $7.1 billion to date, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with the majority of it going to a handful of companies. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. Now in its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The company, based in Richmond, British Columbia, was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. The company is currently building its first demonstration plant, LM26, which it hopes will hit scientific breakeven by 2026. Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. Based in Everett, Washington, Helion has raised $607.64 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Founded in 1998, TAE (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: After the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. TAE has raised $1.32 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Alphabet, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Venrock. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squishes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy has raised $285.65 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. Based in Oxfordshire, U.K., First Light has raised $179.94 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $109.3 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Across three days straight of losses so far in October, investors have cashed out a total of $361.2 million from such products, data from London investment firm Farside Investors shows. The outflows come after a week of solid inflows: Investors last week plugged over $1 billion into the funds. October—dubbed “Uptober” by some traders—is a month generally known for having high crypto prices in the past following what has historically been a chilly September for Bitcoin and other top assets. However, Bitcoin ultimately had a strong September this year after a rough initial start to the month. Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped below $60,000 on Thursday; now it stands at about $62,200, up more than 3% on the day. Bitcoin ETFs—approved for trading in the U.S. in January—led to the rise of the biggest and oldest asset this year. In March, the coin touched a new all-time high of $73,737 as investors previously unwilling to handle crypto assets threw cash at Bitcoin via the new regulated investment vehicles trading on stock exchanges. Wall Street titans such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck all have Bitcoin funds available to investors via brokerage accounts. But the fast-flowing cash has stalled in recent months. The reason? Geopolitical tensions aren’t helping, analysts told Decrypt this week. During times of political instability, investors tend to eye-up “safe haven” assets like gold or treasuries. We’re only in the first week of “Uptober,” though. Will investor sentiment change?

Title: Giant Banks Struggle, But Private Credit Is Soaring

“It’s simple supply and demand” said the President of Monroe Capital. “When banks go through crises, there’s more regulatory oversight and they pull back, which shifts market share from banks to the private credit arena.” This rings especially true in Silicon Valley. I’ve experienced it firsthand through Arc’s capital marketplace, where hundreds of private credit investors like Monroe have been inundated with billions in loan demand since we launched in January. But why? Too Big to Fail banks struggle with reams of regulations and high reserve requirements. Regional banks tread cautiously past the bellyflops of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. In their wake, loans to high-tech outfits in the valley are now harder to find. Venture capital investment in Silicon Valley peaked in 2021 and took a dive. Private equity has followed a rocky path, with leveraged buyouts posting only an 8% return last year, the lowest in over a decade. In the public debt markets, rising interest rates have made borrowing costs untenable for issuers seeking financing. Prolonged economic uncertainty has stretched timelines for issuers. As a result, the market for publicly traded high-yield debt has shrunk by almost 25% in three years says M Capital Group. With crisis comes opportunity: private credit is soaring. The asset class features loans that lie outside the heavily regulated banking system, never to be traded publicly. This ~$2 trillion market is up 50% in the same three years in which public high-yield debt has fallen. Private debt gained $400 billion in that period, while public debt declined the same amount: a telling shift. That fat sum, in effect, left banking giants like J.P. Morgan Chase and flowed to the likes of Blackstone and Apollo. Supply and demand indeed. Private credit outpacing other asset classes Even more surprising: on top of that 50% growth since 2021, the private debt business is set to grow another 87% in the next five years. According to Ashwin Krishnan, co-head of North America Private Credit at Morgan Stanley, the private debt market will soar to $2.8 trillion by 2028. As he writes here, “private credit has filled a lending void” since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting stiff rules imposed on banks for capital requirements, loan terms, and disclosure. This turned the biggest, richest banks in the world into timid lenders, even as demand for loans surged on a rise in infrastructure projects (public and private) for clean energy, new chip plants, electric cars, and, more recently, vast spending on the AI wave. BlackRock has an even more aggressive forecast. It says the private-credit market will double in size to $3.5 trillion in 2028, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, KKR and State Street, the Journal says, now are competing for the next big prize in private debt: “full access to mom-and-pop investors when many sophisticated institutions are filing up on private credit.” The non-bank giants are “jostling to launch private-credit exchange-traded funds and other retail products,” the WSJ states. Apollo, which manages almost $700 billion in assets, expects to originate more than $200 billion a year in private loans eventually, doubling up on $97 billion in debt deals it did last year, the Financial Times reported. The firm sees “large demand to issue high-rated loans that will be purchased by its insurance arm Athene and other independent insurers,” the paper says. In a similar manner, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman recently announced the integration of its private credit and insurance groups in its effort “to reach $1 trillion in the next ten years.” No wonder Jamie Dimon is taking shots at private credit. In his letter to shareholders last month, he wrote: “Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced.” When you can’t beat ’em, impugn their creditworthiness. Jamie wishes his rivals in private credit had to endure the same burdensome regulations that J.P Morgan does. Yet, the ability to sidestep this tangle is precisely why private credit is thriving—and why corporate borrowers are lining up to get it. Unencumbered by a restrictive regulatory framework, private credit investors can move fast and price in risk in a way that banks simply cannot compete. This must be why Citigroup just announced a $25 billion private credit deal with Apollo to better serve Citi’s capital-starved clients. Last month, KKR extolled the private credit business to investors, describing a “structural shift away from the traditional commercial banking model,” and holding up a truly stunning figure: $40 trillion in future opportunity. Apollo, Blackstone and other private market heavyweights have synthetically replicated the traditional commercial banking model. But instead of highly-regulated bank deposits, they’re tapping deep pools of insurance capital, unlocking speed, flexibility and liquidity for the private markets at a time when equity remains expensive. Can you imagine all that business bypassing the likes of J.P. Morgan? As a fintech guy, I surely can. In fact, the upstarts of fintech already are making inroads into the private credit industry. The money center banks are Too Big to Call if you are running a tech company seeking, say, only $10 million to $100 million in financing. Yet, it can be hard to find lenders. The trick lies in how to match up an assortment of lenders, business borrowers, and investors willing to buy into a deal. And for private credit investors, the challenge is sifting through mountains of unstructured private company data to capitalize on the multi-trillion dollar market opportunity. Artificial intelligence, now advancing almost by the hour, can help a lot in this effort. At my company, Arc, we have been working on this, and the early results are exciting and encouraging.

Terenure host Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s taut semi-final at Lakelands Park in the standout tie of the Energia All-Ireland on Saturday afternoon. The two sides are among the cluster of six Division 1A teams who have won one and lost after two rounds. Each took two bonus points from their respective defeats but even so at least one of these big hitters will likely have ground to make up by teatime on Saturday. In light of Peter Sylvester’s departure, Terenure juggle their midfield again, with Jules Fenelon, a close-season capture from Trinity, making his first start, while Chris Cosgrave reverts to inside centre and Aran Egan to outhalf. Notable inclusions on the bench are Marcus Hanon, fit-again captain Luke Clohessy and the highly regarded Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel. Lansdowne give winger Todd Lawlor, part of Newbridge’s SCT last season, his debut and recall brother Donough at number eight. Harry O’Riordan at centre, outhalf Steve McMahon, flanker Clive Ross and tighthead Tom Connolly are all named. Clontarf, with a maximum 10 points, go to UCD at a time when Emerging Ireland and Leinster call-ups have weakened the students. Young Munster face a searching test of their unbeaten start away to champions Cork Constitution, who bounced back from an opening day loss to Terenure by beating Ballynahinch 51-21 last week. After unluckily returning empty-handed from Clontarf, Garryowen will look to build on their encouraging return to 1A at home to winless City of Armagh and ditto St Mary’s, significantly reinforced over the summer, when they head north to Ballynahinch. The two promoted sides have quickly set about supporting the view that they have raised the bar in 1A this season. The 1B pacesetters, Old Belvedere and Nenagh Ormond, will be in proximity when the former host Blackrock in Ollie Campbell Park while the Tipp club face Old Wesley in Energia Park. The 2A quartet with a maximum 10 points are all on the road, with Barnhall in Ballymena, Greytones in Instonians, Navan in Corinthians and Cashel away to Buccaneers. The early leaders in 2B, Wanderers and Skerries, are away to Malone and Dungannon respectively. In the Women’s Division, last season’s dominant two meet as champions UL Bohemians host Railway Union in a reprise of last April’s final at the Aviva Stadium, which the Limerick club won by 48-38. Men’s Division 1A: Ballynahinch v St Mary’s College, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Young Munster, Temple Hill; Garryowen v City of Armagh, Dooradoyle; Terenure College v Lansdowne, Lakelands Park; UCD v Clontarf, Belfield. Division 1B: Highfield v Dublin University, Woodliegh Park; Old Belvedere v Blackrock College, Ollie Campbell Park; Old Wesley v Nenagh Ormond, Energia Park; Queen’s v UCC, Dub Lane; Shannon v Naas, Thomond Park. Division 2A: Ballymena v MU Barnhall, Eaton Park; Buccaneers v Cashel, Dubarry Park; Greystones v Instonians, Dr. Hickey Park; Navan v Corinthians, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Banbridge, Takumi Park. Division 2B: Dungannon v Skerries, Stevenson Park; Galwegians v Clogher Valley, Crowley Park; Malahide v Sligo, Estuary Road; Malone v Wanderers, Gibson Park; UL Bohemian v Rainey, UL4G. Division 2C: Bruff v Belfast Harlequins, Kilballyowen Park; Clonmel v Dolphin, Ardgaoithe; Midleton v Ballyclare, Towns Park; Omagh Academicals v Monkstown, Thomas Mellon Playing Fields; Tullamore v Enniscorthy, Spollanstown. Women’s Division (5.0 unless stated): Ballincollig v Suttonians, Tanner Park (3pm); Cooke v Tullow, Shaws Bridge; Old Belvedere v Blackrock College, Ollie Campbell Park; UL Bohemian v Railway Union, UL4G; Wicklow v Galwegians, Ashtown Lane.

Title: Investors look to earnings to support record-high stock prices

By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - A high-stakes corporate earnings season kicks into gear next week, with bullish investors hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in a U.S. stock market near record highs. The case for strong U.S. economic growth got a boost on Friday, after labor market data came in far above expectations. The S&P 500 is up 20% year-to-date and stands near record highs despite recent tumult spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. A key test for the rally will arrive as corporate results begin rolling in next week. Companies need to post healthy profit growth and strong outlooks for next year to sustain valuations that have crept up in recent months: At 21.5 times future 12-month earnings estimates, the S&P 500 is trading near its highest level in three years and is well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. "One of the few rationales that the bulls can make for these lofty (valuation) multiples is that earnings growth keeps coming in at high levels," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "With prices having run up, you really do need that earnings growth to come in probably at much better than expected levels." S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 4.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, UBS equity strategists said in a report on Wednesday. However, earnings likely grew 8.5% when factoring in the historical rate of positive earnings surprises, the UBS strategists said. Such profit beats may be needed to fuel more gains in stocks. Since 2010, the S&P 500's total return has closely tracked the increase in company earnings and dividends, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. But the index has run ahead since early 2023, and is now about 18% above expected levels, based on current earnings and dividends, Ablin found. "The market's a little bit over its skis here," Ablin said. "It's certainly anticipating some pretty strong earnings and dividend growth." Data on U.S. consumer prices due next week will give investors another snapshot of the economy. A stronger than expected number, on the heels of Friday's jobs data, could further curtail expectations for how much the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in coming months. Futures tied to the fed funds rate on Friday showed pricing of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed's November meeting falling to 5%, from over 30% on Thursday, according to CME FedWatch. BANKS IN SPOTLIGHT Major financial firms highlight next week's earnings reports, with JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) due on Oct 11. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the state of delinquencies and loan demand, said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. More broadly, VanCronkhite will be looking for signs that the Fed's initial 50-basis point cut - delivered at its monetary policy meeting last month - is already having an effect on the economy through such channels as rising auto sales and other big ticket purchases. Ideally, such activity will be sustained even if expectations for further rate cuts fall further following Friday's strong jobs report. Following the first rate cut, companies ideally will show leading demand indicators are strengthening, VanCronkhite said. "That would probably give me confidence that we're heading more towards that soft landing," he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Jio Financial and U.S.-based BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) got in-principle approval from India's markets regulator to act as co-sponsors and set up a mutual fund business in the country, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group company said on Friday. Jio Financial said the Securities and Exchange Board of India will grant the final approval after the two companies fulfil certain requirements, on which it did not elaborate. Days after its demerger from Reliance Industries in July 2023, the company had announced the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with BlackRock to launch asset management services in India. The companies signed a second joint venture in April to set up a wealth management and broking business in the country.
