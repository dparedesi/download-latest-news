Watcher Guru hack reveals security gaps on X as fake XRP news sparks turmoil in crypto community. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto-focused media outlet Watcher Guru confirmed that its official X account was hacked to promote a fake report claiming Ripple and SWIFT were close to a deal to use XRP in global payment systems. The unauthorized post went live on March 21 at 2:05 A.M. UTC. It falsely stated that Ripple would soon partner with SWIFT and that billions of XRP had been locked in escrow as liquidity reserves. The post quickly gained attention and sparked excitement in the XRP community, with many users believing it was true. For context, Bitrue, a prominent pro-XRP crypto exchange, mistakenly shared the fake news, amplifying the confusion. Shortly after, Watcher Guru clarified the situation, confirming that the post did not come from their team. According to the media outlet: “Our X account has been hacked and the previous post (now deleted) was posted by a hacker. We have 2FA enabled and have taken extreme measures to avoid hacks.” Due to automation, the same false report was also shared on Watcher Guru’s other social media accounts, including Telegram, Facebook, and Discord. The team said the reposting bot pushed the content to all channels before the issue was spotted. Meanwhile, Watcher Guru stated that the attacker had blocked Ripple’s official X account and that of its CEO Brad Garlinghouse to “presumably slow down a ‘false report’ response from their team.” This marks the second major breach of a prominent crypto platform on X. Earlier this week, DB News’ X account was hacked and used to spread a fake report about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a false BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. Watcher Guru believes the breach may have started weeks earlier as its team had received a suspicious X link through Telegram on March 5. According to the team: “We noticed the link was formatted in a strange way. It was an official X Developer staging site using X’s official domain, however it included a specific path and ‘token’ query string which X links do not normally have.” Watcher Guru stated that its team flagged the link and contacted X’s Head of Cybersecurity, Christopher Stanley, but received no reply. Watcher Guru continued that while it cannot confirm the link that caused the hack, the firm noted that its breach resembled that of DB News, another crypto media outlet. According to Watcher Guru, its account, like DB News, had two-factor authentication enabled, no connected apps, and no API tokens were used to post the false information. It concluded: “At this time, we have not yet determined the exact source or method behind the hack. All unauthorized posts have been removed, and our account has been secured. We are contacting X for further clarification.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Real-World Assets Cross $10 Billion in Total Value Locked: DeFiLlama

Real-world assets (RWAs) are now a $10 billion category, according to data curated by DeFiLlama, with Maker, BlackRock's BUIDL and Ethena's USDtb each accounting for more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Of the three, USDtb — a stablecoin designed to contrast with Ethena's USDe — has had the fastest growth, adding over 1,000% in TVL in the last month. USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares whereas USDe uses crypto-assets and perpetual futures strategies for crypto-driven yields. CoinDesk previously reported that Treasury-backed tokens reached a record $4.2 billion market cap in the first quarter, driven by growth in Ondo Finance's OUSG and USDY tokens, BlackRock and Securitize's BUIDL, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Superstate's USTB. Treasury-backed tokens dominate, according to data aggregator RWA.xyz. The next highest category, tokenized commodities, comes in at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading with TVL of just over $500 million. Analysts say this reflects investor preference for safer assets amid bearish crypto sentiment, with T-bills outperforming what's offered for yield with major DeFi protocols like Compound.

Title: The climate movement is talking about carbon all wrong, a new book argues
URL: http://grist.org/language/paul-hawken-book-climate-movement-carbon/
Time Published: 2025-03-21T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Burning oil, gas, and coal — literal fossil fuels, made from the compressed remains of ancient plants and plankton — has released carbon into Earth’s atmosphere, where it traps heat and alters the climate. That process has caused massive destruction and loss of life, and it will continue to do so. As a result, carbon came to be seen as something to “fight,” “combat,” and “capture.” Paul Hawken, the author of the new book Carbon: The Book of Life, argues that the climate movement is thinking about its work, and messaging, all wrong. “Those who call carbon a pollutant might want to lay down their word processor,” Hawken writes. Carbon, he notes, is after all the building block of life, the animating force behind trees, rhinos, eyelashes, hormones, bamboo, and so much more. Without it, Earth would just be a lonely, dead rock. So much for decarbonizing. Hawken has come to believe that treating carbon as something to tackle, liquefy, and pump into geological formations not only reflects the same mindset that caused climate change in the first place, but also further alienates people from the living world. There is no “climate crisis,” he argues, but a crisis of human thinking and behavior that’s degrading the soil, wiping out entire species, and changing the weather faster than people can adapt. “From a planetary view,” he writes in Carbon, “the warming atmosphere is a response, an adjustment, a teaching.” The book records a shift in his thinking. In 2017, Hawken published Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming, a book that ranked 100 climate solutions by how much they could reduce carbon emissions, from refrigerant leaks to food waste. The nonprofit Project Drawdown, which he launched, continues to implement these kinds of fixes around the world. But now, Hawken is forgoing straightforward metrics to focus on what he sees as a deeper cultural problem. “The living world is a complex interactive system and doesn’t lend itself to simple solutions,” he said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The new book frames carbon as a flow — a cycle that moves through the atmosphere, oceans, soil, with the element absorbed by growing plants and exhaled in every animal breath. Hawken’s book is a lesson in what’s sometimes called “unlearning,” or letting go of old assumptions, like the idea that nature is something to fix or control. The book explores ways to repair a broken relationship with the natural world, drawing inspiration from Indigenous cultures and new scientific discoveries. Hawken marvels at how much remains unknown about carbon, which he dubs “the most mysterious element of all.” The book’s poetic language offers a stark contrast to the warlike terms climate advocates tend to use to describe carbon. Hawken argues that the typical metaphors are not only inaccurate — how exactly do you battle an element? — but also provide fuel for right-wing narratives that carbon has been unfairly demonized. Last week, E&E News reported that the Trump administration is planning a federal report making the case that a warming world would be a good thing, a pretext for weakening climate regulations. “Carbon dioxide is not an evil gas,” David Legates, a former Trump official, said in a recent video put out by the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank. “Rather, it’s a gas beneficial to life on Earth. It’ll increase temperatures slightly, and warmer temperatures are certainly better than colder temperatures.” Hawken wants a broad shift in how people talk about the natural world, though, not just a rethinking of the climate movement’s metaphors. He points to how financial institutions increasingly refer to nature as a commodity. In January, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declared “natural capital” an investment priority. In February, Goldman Sachs launched a “biodiversity bond fund” turning ecosystems into investment products. The jargon used in scientific reports and global climate conferences also creates a sense of detachment that dulls the living things it refers to. Hawken describes the word “biodiversity” as “a bloodless term” and “carbon neutrality” as an absurd “biophysical impossibility.” Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How “We are numbed by the science, puzzled by jargon, paralyzed by predictions, confused about what actions to take, stressed as we scramble to care for our family, or simply impoverished, overworked, and tired,” Hawken writes. “Most of humanity doesn’t talk about climate change because we do not know what to say.” Even plainspoken terms like “nature” are suspect, in Hawken’s view: The concept only seems to exist to mark a separation between humans and the rest of the world. He points out that the Chicham language of the Achuar people in the Amazon doesn’t have a word for nature, nor do other Indigenous languages. “Such words would only be needed if the Achuar experienced nature as distinct from the self,” he writes. English, by contrast, he describes as a “rootless” language, borrowing terms from so many places that it struggles to teach the kind of deep, reciprocal relationships that are born from living in one place and caring for it over many generations. Hawken hopes to mend that separation by helping people discover the flow of carbon in their daily lives and kindle a sense of wonder about it. Carbon delves into mind-bending scientific discoveries about the kind of marvels that carbon makes possible. Bees, with their two-milligram brains, appear able to count, learn by observation, feel pain and pleasure, and even recognize their own knowledge. The rye plant senses the world around it with more than 14 million roots and root hairs, a network that one plant neurobiologist described as a type of brain. Hawken’s book is a reminder that carbon — despite all the problems caused by releasing too much of it into the atmosphere — is actually a gift. The goal of Carbon isn’t to map out a plan for saving the Earth, but to rekindle a sense of relationship with it. Where Hawken lives in California, his community recently restored a salmon stream, breaking down a concrete barrier under a bridge that had blocked the fish on their final journey up the stream to spawn. “The core of it is about care, and kindness, and connection, and compassion, and generosity,” Hawken said. “That’s where regeneration starts.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: BlackRock thinks Bitcoin could thrive in a recession – Will it?

Market sentiment on Bitcoin’s ability to hedge against economic pressure remains mixed. Bitcoin [BTC], at the time of writing, was trading at $85,387, up 2.30% in the last 24 hours. However, market sentiment remains divided. In fact, inflows have dropped by 54%, from 58.6K BTC/day to 26.9K BTC/day. Despite this, Blackrock’s Robbie Mitchnick believes Bitcoin could thrive, even in a recession. He pointed out that Bitcoin benefits from fiscal stimulus, lower interest rates, and monetary easing – All common during economic downturns. Additionally, fears of social unrest may push more people towards Bitcoin as a hedge. As Q2 unfolds, Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven will be put to the ultimate test. Will it prove its resilience? Through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), Blackrock has established itself as a major institutional player in the Bitcoin market, holding 570,582 BTC in its treasury. This includes a notable addition of 22,076 BTC this year alone. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Blackrock’s Head of Digital Assets, attributed Bitcoin’s decline below $80k on 10 March to “premature expectations” around the economic outlook. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) According to AMBCrypto, key factors include early rate cut speculation, Bitcoin’s evolving role as a strategic reserve, and insufficient awareness of the U.S debt crisis. Further compounding these pressures are Trump’s strict tariff plans. While the short-term market reaction led to the sharp “dip,” Blackrock’s $218.10 million in inflows – its monthly high – has reinforced Mitchnick’s thesis. The likelihood of a U.S recession has returned to the forefront after the FOMC meeting, with Chairman Jerome Powell adopting a “wait-and-see” stance. Essentially, the possibility of a recession cannot be entirely ruled out just yet. A key bullish signal during a recession is economic slowdown. Weak labor data dampens aggregate demand, prompting the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity via interest rate cuts. This liquidity influx often supports risk assets like Bitcoin in the medium term. However, while Blackrock maintains a bullish position, a recession typically unfolds through a brief cycle of declining demand, rising unemployment, and market corrections. This could put Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative to the test. Bitcoin’s 22% decline from its all-time high of $109k could potentially signal the onset of a larger market correction, with more volatility ahead. This, unless Trump’s economic retest triggers a shift in market conditions. In February, inflation saw a month-on-month decline of 0.2%, dipping from 3% in January. Source: Trading Economics This easing inflationary pressure has led the Fed to halt rate hikes, though the possibility of further hikes remains on the horizon. Blackrock’s bullish thesis hinges on a more pronounced market flush-out – A sign that a deeper correction may be required before a bull market can truly materialize.

Title: The stablecoin trap: How financial surveillance is already here

The current U.S. financial system already operates as a digital control grid, with 92% of dollars existing only in databases, transactions monitored without warrants, and access to money revocable at any time. Government agencies like the IRS, NSA and Treasury collect and analyze financial data with minimal oversight. Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), are not decentralized but controlled by major financial institutions. Proposed legislation like the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act enshrine financial surveillance, requiring strict KYC tracking on all transactions. A total ofÂ 134 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The European Central Bank plans to launch a digital euro by 2025, while Canadaâs leadership aligns with the World Economic Forum to advance a digital Canadian dollar. The ultimate goal is to tokenize all assets â stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities â under a global ledger, enabling governments to monitor and program transactions for compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer resistance to censorship and untraceable transactions. The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy.

Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer resistance to censorship and untraceable transactions. The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy. The debate over Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has dominated headlines, with fears of a dystopian future where governments monitor and control every financial transaction. But what if the dystopia is already here? A closer look at the current financial system reveals that the surveillance state isnât coming â itâs already in place. The rise of stablecoins â cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar â has been hailed as a bridge between the volatile world of crypto and the stability of fiat currency. However, beneath the surface, these digital assets are becoming a backdoor to total financial control, enabling governments and corporations to monitor, restrict and even revoke access to money with the click of a button. The illusion of financial freedom The U.S. financial system is already a digital control grid. According to Patrick Wood, Editor at the Brownstone Institute, âThe battle isnât about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing.â Consider these facts: 92% of all U.S. dollars exist only as entries in databases. Your transactions are monitored by government agenciesâwithout warrants. Your access to money can be revoked at any time with a keystroke. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. The stablecoin Trojan Horse While President Trumpâs Executive Order 14178 ostensibly bans CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isnât comingâitâs here. The stakes are real, and the time to act is now.

ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isnât comingâitâs here. The stakes are real, and the time to act is now. Sources include: Technocracy.news Forbes.com GlobalLegalInsights.com The rise of stablecoins â cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar â has been hailed as a bridge between the volatile world of crypto and the stability of fiat currency. However, beneath the surface, these digital assets are becoming a backdoor to total financial control, enabling governments and corporations to monitor, restrict and even revoke access to money with the click of a button. The illusion of financial freedom The U.S. financial system is already a digital control grid. According to Patrick Wood, Editor at the Brownstone Institute, âThe battle isnât about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing.â Consider these facts: 92% of all U.S. dollars exist only as entries in databases. Your transactions are monitored by government agenciesâwithout warrants. Your access to money can be revoked at any time with a keystroke. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. The stablecoin Trojan Horse While President Trumpâs Executive Order 14178 ostensibly bans CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP.

Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isnât comingâitâs here. The stakes are real, and the time to act is now.

Business FILE PHOTO: The entrance of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, in Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG :Shares of CK Hutchison fell on Friday after the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate reported weak earnings and dividends and said its operating environment would be volatile. Underlying profit for the group, which is having to contend with displeasure from Beijing over the sale of its ports business, slid 11 per cent of HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion) last year, slightly short of expectations. Its final dividend was cut to HK$1.514 per share from HK$1.775 for 2023. Shares in the company lost 1.9 per cent in early Hong Kong trade. The company has agreed to sell its ports business to a BlackRock-led consortium, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal. The deal is expected to garner the firm more than $19 billion in cash but has been criticised by Beijing. CK Hutchison made no mention of the ports deal in its earnings statement, although it said "geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly." "The operating environment for the Group's businesses is expected to be both volatile and unpredictable," it said in the statement. It added that it will constrain capital spending and new investment and focus on stringent cash flow management.

More Info Donald Trump’s second presidency has unquestionably upended the energy world—and the energy investment world. With the IRA in deep freeze and rollbacks of various climate change-related regulation, some of the biggest players in financial markets are feeling the heat. Hedge funds with a focus on energy have found themselves in a juggling act on a tightrope. Bloomberg wrote this week that a lot of money managers were scrambling to strike the right balance between investors who were still insistent that emission-cutting commitments were priority number one and those who are accepting energy reality for what it is and seeking to replace those commitments with profits. Some pension funds in northern Europe, for instance, were discussing a pullout from the United States because of the Trump administration’s dismissal of the climate change fight, which those pension funds’ managements see as ignoring a substantial future investment risk, Bloomberg reported. Interestingly, British funds are doing the opposite, riding the wave of reprioritization to keep those investors who are in the game to make money rather than save the planet. Some specific examples provided by Bloomberg include a Dutch pension fund, DME, that is reviewing a $5-billion mandate with Blackrock because its management feels the U.S. financial giant has stopped taking its transition ambitions seriously, jeopardizing the Dutch pensioners’ money. As the fund put it, “BlackRock’s diminishing ambitions in responsible and sustainable investing” were threatening the $5 billion. Related: Chinese EVs Surge in Global Markets Interestingly, BlackRock is also the central character of another investment review noted by Bloomberg, this time for its too big of a focus on the energy transition, as perceived by the investment fund—the state pension fund of Indiana. Because of that perception, which is the exact opposite of DME’s perception of the same investment bank, the pension fund of Indiana pulled its money out of BlackRock and put it in State Street. The Bloomberg report comes days after the founder of a hedge fund specifically set up to invest in the energy transition declared the transition dead, “for now.” Speaking to Bloomberg again, Nishant Gupta, founder of Kanou Capital, said that “The whole sector — solar, wind, hydrogen, fuel cells — anything clean is dead for now,” adding that the fundamentals in the energy transition space were “very poor.” Another recent report, this time by the Financial Times, strengthens the perception that not all is well with the transition and maybe the investment entities shifting their focus have a point. In that report, the FT said that green energy stocks had slumped to the lowest in five years despite an improving interest rate environment and continued strong government support for all things transition. “Companies that we hold in the decarbonization sector have seen strong growth and stable returns, but they have underperformed in terms of share price,” the FT cited the chief of sustainable equity at Ninety One, Deirdre Cooper, as saying. “I have never seen such bearishness in terms of the valuation for companies with structural growth . . . The market is assuming no growth for decarbonisation [ie the sector],” Cooper added. In the latest sign that a shift is underway in the energy investment world, Aviva Investors, a division of French insurance giant Aviva, revised plans to divest from companies that are, according to Aviva, not doing enough to decarbonize. The investment arm of the insurer cited a “very different macro backdrop” and the fact that “Concerns over energy security and economic recovery have come to the fore, which in turn has had an impact on the regulatory environment and trajectory of national decarbonisation plans.” The energy transition was supposed to be strong, unstoppable, and accelerating. Instead, it is slowing down, despite the massive government support, and returns, where there were any, are down, too. As one executive from a French climate NGO told Bloomberg, “Financial institutions will need to pick a side.” Indeed they will—the choice would be between the side that makes money and the side that loses it.

Title: Hapag-Lloyd CEO Foresees ‘Considerable’ Changes to USTR Port Fee Proposal
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/hapag-lloyd-ceo-port-fees-proposal-ocean-carriers-container-shipping-1234741300/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T20:54:25Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen expects the proposed U.S. port fees on Chinese ships to add “considerable” additional costs to U.S. consumers, and “make life a lot more difficult” for American exporters. However, the CEO is optimistic the proposal will look different once industry and public feedback rolls in. After the March 24 hearing on the port fees takes place, Habben Jansen expects there will be considerable changes to the current proposal. Under the U.S. Trade Representative’s current recommendation, Chinese ships could be paying as much as $1.5 million to dock at an American port. “Once something comes out, we will need to decide how to react,” Habben Jansen said, comparing the current scenario to when the Ocean Shipping Reform Act was signed into law in 2022. That law expanded the powers of the Federal Maritime Commission, enabling the government agency to more heavily scrutinize ocean carriers and terminal operators for perceived unfair practices like imposing detention and demurrage fees, or refusing to honor contracts with shippers. “Initially, the very first ideas about what should be done were quite difficult and very complex, and not particularly well thought through,” Habben Jansen said. “Then there was this similar consultation process and in the end, the final ruling that came out was actually very workable and also reasonable and in my opinion also suited for purpose. We hope that something similar will happen now.” Related Stories Topics Maersk Shareholders Vote Against Halting Military Equipment Shipments to Israel Topics Red Sea Risks Re-Escalate as US Hits Houthis with Airstrikes Habben Jansen made the comments early Thursday during Hapag-Lloyd’s earnings call, which saw the ocean carrier’s revenue jump 6 percent to $5.3 billion on a net income on profits that dipped 19 percent to $754 million. Like Gemini Cooperation partner Maersk, the timing of the return of container ships to the Red Sea will do some heavy lifting in shaping how much profit Hapag-Lloyd will generate in 2025. Group earnings before interest and taxes is projected to be in the range of $0 to $1.5 billion for the year, putting the top end at nearly half of 2024’s EBIT of $2.8 billion. The earnings expectations assume that the Red Sea passages will be gradually resumed in the second half of 2025. But the recent breaking of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and new U.S. attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen both make conditions tougher for ocean carriers to consider bringing vessels back through the Suez Canal. Hapag-Lloyd’s 2025 projections also account for the impact of U.S.-levied tariffs and potential counter measures, although the company’s annual report indicates that the situation “could not be reliably assessed.” The guidance didn’t impress shareholders, with Hapag-Lloyd stock falling nearly 8 percent in Thursday trading. According to Habben Jansen, cargo volumes for the new fiscal year are expected to increase more than 10 percent for the Germany-based container shipping giant due to the Gemini Cooperation launch with Maersk, alongside a higher mix of long-term contracts in its larger book of business than compared to last year. “That has been a conscious choice because we believe that we need that in order to get to that 10 percent growth,” Habben Jansen said. “That gives us some protection against fluctuations in the spot market because a bigger chunk of our volume will not fluctuate with those rates. But in fairness, we are still vulnerable if spot rates go down too much.” The company acknowledged that geopolitical disputes, especially an escalation of the Middle East conflicts, could negatively influence volume development. Hapag-Lloyd anticipates a moderate decline in average freight rate compared to last year, which saw extended volatility due to the Red Sea concerns and capacity constraints. As of Thursday, Drewry’s World Container Index lists average ocean spot freight rates at $2,264 per container, down 4 percent from the week prior and down 42 percent since the start of the year. Habben Jansen also gave insight into the early stages of the Gemini Cooperation vessel-sharing alliance, which now has 46 of its 57 services up and running. More than half of the ships have been phased into the network, he said. The CEO said the company’s schedule reliability is hovering around roughly 90 percent, meeting the goal both Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk agreed upon last year. However, container shipping database EeSea said this week that the reliability metrics have been on a recent downward trend since the beginning of February. Since Feb. 24, Gemini arrivals have had a weekly on-time performance of 87 percent, 84 percent and 83 percent, respectively. The Germany-based shipping company isn’t sweating the recent slippage. “There is certainly quite a lot of fine-tuning to do left, right and center, but we also still see many things that we can do better. Of anything, I’m probably more confident now than I was six or eight weeks ago that we will be able to deliver that 90 percent schedule reliability consistently,” Habben Jansen said. “If we fast forward three or six months, then I’m fairly sure that a lot of many of our customers, analysts and others in the market will also be able to determine that there is indeed a material difference based on all the data that is available.” Beyond adjusting its Maersk partnership, Hapag-Lloyd is building up its terminal portfolio, with aims to expand its current slate from 21 terminals to over 30 by 2030. The planned expansion reflects a wider trend among operators like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—which scooped up 43 ports as part of the BlackRock-led consortium that also acquired both Panama Canal-adjacent ports—to gain greater control over their supply chains.

(ABC North Queensland: Georgia Loney) Rainfall is easing in north Queensland but some heavy falls are still possible. Multiple flood warnings are in place in north Queensland. North Queensland residents and businesses are dealing with the impact of their second flood in as many months. Heavy rainfall may be easing in some areas in north Queensland, but the impact of a days-long deluge is still being felt. Areas around Townsville, like Ingham, are dealing with the fallout of their second flood in as many months. "Grounds are very saturated and rivers are already swollen, so additional rainfall has simply nowhere to go," Senior Meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said. "We are expecting showers and thunderstorms across northern and western parts of the state. "Higher falls are also possible about the north-east tropical coast between Cairns and Townsville, associated with those days of heavy rain and flooding." The rain has caused further damage to the Sooning Street Bridge on Magnetic Island. (Supplied) A major flood warning is in place for the Herbert River, with minor flood warnings current for the Tully, Ross, Bohle, and Haughton Rivers. The Bureau of Meteorology said the next couple of days will see the risk of heavy falls along the stretch of coast between Townsville and Cairns easing back. "We've got significant moisture streaming off the Gulf of Carpentaria and feeding into a likely thunderstorm risk across parts of the Peninsula, the Gulf country and the North-West districts," Ms Bradbury said. Cane growers say the latest deluge of wet weather could delay this year's cane crush. Canegrowers are concerned more rain will delay crushing. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney) Some towns in north Queensland have seen 24-hour rainfall totals of more than 400 millimetres this week as the region cleans up from February floods. Growers are still reeling from damage caused earlier in the wet season. Leah Russo is a Grower Director on the Canegrowers Herbert River Board says there are concerns with more wet weather on the way. "It is possible that if the rain continues, which forecasters are saying that maybe towards the end of next week, we could be in for more significant rain, " she said. There are roads in north Queensland that are still closed due to damage caused by the February floods. Residents in the holiday town of Paluma, about 90 kilometres from Townsville, say they are completely isolated again. Paluma residents must take a two-hour detour to avoid landslips on Mount Spec Road. (Supplied: Department of Transport and Main Roads) Tourism operator Kurt Harlow said they had been told by Transport and Main Roads that Mount Spec Road would be open by the end of April, but to locals only. "We've had two major tourism organisations that have had to cancel their bookings for the rest of the year," he said. "We can't do that … we'll be broke." Frustration is brewing for people in north Queensland impacted by ongoing road closures. Mechanic Jaxon Kaupilla got stuck in Ingham yesterday after driving in from Blackrock to work. Jaxon Kaupilla says he was stranded in Ingham on Thursday. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney) "I wish we could somehow improve our road systems so this happens less."

Title: Exclusive Poll: Majority of Americans Oppose ESG as State Financial Officers Fight Against It
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/20/exclusive-poll-majority-americans-oppose-esg-state-financial-officers-fight-against-it/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T18:53:40Z
Full Content:
A majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. A survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that “ESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.” In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion. Eighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges. ESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice. O.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized. He said: When asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers. Americans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state’s finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency. Many large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting. Here are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford’s most egregious proxy votes: State financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America. The same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry. In 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels. “The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,” Hegar said in a statement at the time. The strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term “ESG” as it has been “weaponized.” “We have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people’s money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,” Oleka concluded. Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, “These results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,” he said. “They see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That’s what every SFOF member is doing.” “We won’t rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,” he vowed.

Are households owning individual stocks or stocks in an ETF/mutual fund. How they own stocks makes a difference. if a majority of the investors are prone to panic sell, the market may reflect that... but not for long. Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers. yup....left wing media: Americans not saving money??? Bad Americans investing int he stock market? Bad bttt The article is referring to individual accounts. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. “Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers.” ___________________________________________________________ The regular “household” investor is supposed to be the patsy. As long as the post WW2 inflationary market holds up, the index fund investors who have held their holdings throughout numerous economic storms should perform nicely. The wildcard, which I don’t forsee happening anytime soon, would be the type of deflationary pressure that hit in the mid 1920’s and continued throughout the 1930’s. In that environment, you would want to hold dividend paying companies that held up their valuations the best, as well as holding a strong cash position and protecting your money in Treasuries. I have bought more stock in the last month than all of last year. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you GAMESTOP and the Robinhood rip off. To The Moon!!! Who reads the article? ;-) U.S. households are more invested in stocks than ever and it’s distorting market valuation, says JPMorgan Didn’t she once flash her boobs on The Gong Show? A majority of USA investors hold some or all their money in ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. We’ve been taught over the last 40 years that the only thing that beats inflation is stocks. Don’t blame the people for drawing the only sane conclusion. JP Morgan thinks ordinary Americans are saving and investing too much money? Maybe it’s time for JPMorgan to exit the equities markets and switch to bitcoin, fine art (Hunter Biden paintings are at a discount right now), and politicians’ futures. Buying and owning politicians is still out of reach for rank and file Americans, but for JPMorgan, it’s a natural. Real estate used to be a sound investment for the little guys, and in some places it still is, but in blue cities and states, it puts a “tax me” sign on people’s backs. JPMorgan is big enough to hedge on Ukrainian farmground, especially given its ability to play the politicians futures markets, but that is beyond most of us. Where does JPMorgan suggest middle class Americans park their retirement savings? Passbook savings accounts? This is why I’m 74% in T-Bills and a few Bonds. Stock/Bond account is right at a record high though, so that’s good. I hold 7 stocks, 5 of which pay good dividends. Slow and steady is fine at my age, I don’t even touch any of this money, it’s for the heirs if I don’t blow it. In other words, only the elites should get to control the stock market.

Stock and other traditional financial asset traders across the world are wanting to be able to buy and sell assets around the clock, resulting in two of the biggest stock markets in the U.S., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) making moves to offer round-the-clock trading soon. “We definitely see that this is where the markets are moving,” said Giang Bui, Nasdaq’s head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday. “There's a lot of demand globally for U.S. stocks and people want to trade within the hours that they're typically awake, and I think a lot of it is because people are used to trading crypto 24/7.” Both Nasdaq and the NYSE are in the process of receiving approval to open their venues 24 hours a day, for five or even seven days a week. Nasdaq recently announced that it had begun engaging with regulators about the change while the NYSE has already received the green light. Round-the-clock trading can have several advantages for markets, including increased volume and market liquidity as traders aren’t tied to specific time zones. Currently, the U.S. stock market opens for trading at 9:30 a.m. ET and closes at 4 p.m. ET. “We're hearing it across the board from global broker dealers, clients who they're servicing, even within the U.S., there's a number of U.S. brokers that already are offering overnight trading because their customers are used to trading crypto in those hours,” Bui added. Nasdaq lists a number of crypto-related products, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the spot ETF issued by BlackRock, which saw the most successful ETF debut in the history of U.S. ETF launches. Earlier today, the exchange listed two Solana (SOL) futures ETFs issued by Volatility Shares.

One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Summing up $19,230 and $6,820, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $26,050. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Lamar Advertising stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 160.5%. However, this figure is significantly less than the S&P 500 total return for the same period, which was 223.6%. Lamar Advertising has a consensus rating of "Neutral" and a price target of $132.33 based on the ratings of six analysts. The price target implies more than 16% potential upside from the current stock price. On Feb. 20, the company announced its Q4 2024 earnings, posting revenues of $579.567 million, missing the consensus estimate of $583.190 million, as reported by Benzinga. See Also: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth “Our revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, aided by strength in political, local and programmatic. This allowed us to deliver full-year AFFO of $7.99 per share, above the top end of our revised guidance range,” said CEO Sean Reilly. “For 2025, we anticipate further growth in diluted AFFO, to a range of $8.13 to $8.28 per share.” Given the expected upside potential, growth-focused investors may find Lamar Advertising stock attractive.

Title: CK Hutchison Flags Political Risk as Port Deal Upsets China

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: Shutterstock/Strikernia (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. warned of a deteriorating global business environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions, as the Hong Kong conglomerate reported weaker-than-expected profit while a ports sale plan faces uncertainty after infuriating Beijing. Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s flagship firm reported a 27% decline in net income to HK$17.1 billion ($2.2 billion) for 2024, missing analyst expectations for HK$22.5 billion, according to a statement Thursday. Revenue came in at HK$476.7 billion, compared with HK$462 billion a year earlier. It announced a full-year dividend of HK$2.2 per share, compared with HK$2.53 per share a year before. CK Hutchison, now led by Li’s son Victor Li, has been caught in the crosshairs of increasing tensions between the US and China since it announced an agreement to sell 43 ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. While the conglomerate is set to make $19 billion in cash proceeds from the deal, the agreement has enraged Beijing after President Donald Trump touted it as reclaiming the Panama canal. “The operating environment for the group’s businesses is expected to be both volatile and unpredictable,” Chairman Victor Li said in the statement. He cautioned about headwinds from geopolitical developments, which could in turn spawn supply chain disruptions in the early part of 2025. The group will rein in capital spending and new investment, while tasking its businesses to increase productivity and reduce operating spending, Li said. Several Chinese state agencies are studying CK Hutchison’s ports deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. It’s unclear what levers China can pull to block the deal, given that it involves the company’s overseas assets only. The group has kept all of its ports in Hong Kong and mainland China. CK Hutchison’s statement didn’t mention the sale of its ports portfolio, including the two terminals it operates in the Panama canal. While the group typically holds press and analyst briefings following the announcement of its annual results, they were skipped this year, highlighting the sensitivity of the deal. The company reported an 11% increase in revenue at its ports and related services business, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rising 19%, helped by more export activities in a port in southern China, as well as supply chain relocations benefiting ports in Asia and Latin America. But the ports sector remains CK Hutchison’s smallest revenue contributor with an input of 9%, falling behind other businesses including retail, infrastructure and telecommunications. The group has reported progress in a planned merger of its £15 billion UK telecoms business with Vodafone Group Plc, which secured approval from the country’s antitrust authorities. The group is working with the authorities to put in place the final undertakings in order to close the transaction within the first half of this year, it said in the statement. Meanwhile, investors have boosted options bets to an eight-year high, as they await more clues on the ports deal, a definitive agreement for which is expected to be signed by April 2. The group’s operations in Hong Kong and mainland China mainly include ports in places like Shenzhen and Shanghai, supermarkets, health and beauty retail, telecommunications and biotech development. These businesses could become targets if Chinese authorities decide to penalize the company for selling to the US what they view as strategic assets to China’s interest. But the group’s diversified global portfolio could help ease the impact of a potential political fallout. Hong Kong and China accounted for 12% of revenue in 2024, while Europe, Canada and Australia made up the bulk of the rest. The Li family’s real estate arm CK Asset Holdings Ltd. reported net income of HK$13.7 billion, compared to HK$17.3 billion in the previous year. Hong Kong, the company’s main property market, has been experiencing a prolonged downturn due to expensive interest rates and an oversupply of homes. CK, along with other developers in the city, will have to offer apartments on the cheap to lure buyers. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: What Crypto to Buy as BlackRock Predicts Bitcoin Rally During US Recession
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/what-crypto-to-buy-as-blackrock-predicts-bitcoin-rally-during-us-recession/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T15:16:53Z

Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, spoke recently to Yahoo Finance, saying a recession would be a proper opportunity for Bitcoin to thrive. Mitchnick posited that while he is unsure a recession will happen, the economic conditions inherent in a recession would serve as a strong catalyst for Bitcoin’s growth. If so, what’s the best crypto to buy right now? Could exciting new projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), Meme Index Token ($MEMEX), and PancakeSwap ($CAKE) ride the crypto upswing to see some sensational returns? “If you look at bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis, it really seems like an asset that should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors that exist,” BlackRock global head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick. pic.twitter.com/9HvuxH30vi — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) March 18, 2025 In the interview, Mitchnick broke down the typical catalysts for Bitcoin, all of which happen during a recession: If Mitchnick is right about a recession triggering Bitcoin’s rise, could this dip be just a temporary phase in a larger bull run? Other industry experts like Arthur Hayes co-founder of BitMEX, seem to think so. The plan: Be fucking patient. $BTC likely bottoms around $70k. 36% correction from $110k ATH, v normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, $SPX and $NDX to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 11, 2025 Mitchnick’s views are also supported by Coinbase, which reported in its Monthly Outlook that investors should be prepared for a potential crypto market recovery in Q2, 2025, particularly if the US economy enters a recession. The recovering liquidity and reduced interest rates, combined with positive regulatory movements, create a positive environment for investment. If Michnick’s predictions are accurate, we can expect increased activity around other cryptocurrencies aside from $BTC, too. That’s why we’ve rounded up three of the best crypto to buy right now that have the potential to do well amidst a recession and a Bitcoin rally You hear the word ‘bull,’ and you think, strong, confident, large, and in charge, and that’s exactly what you get with Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Its primary focus is to get a shoulder to the wheel and push Bitcoin to $1M+. It’s still in presale, so early buyers can also earn an impressive 115% APY by staking. Need more incentives? No problem, BTC Bull Token comes with stacks. For example, if you hold your tokens in Best Wallet, you’ll get free $BTC airdrop rewards when Bitcoin reaches the $150K, $200K, and $250K milestones. The project team has also planned token burns at every $25k interval. These increase scarcity and thus value, helping bolster returns. If you’re anything like us, getting something for nothing is always a draw. And with offers like these, $BTCBULL is sure to continue to attract attention. And, with recession features being potential catalysts for Bitcoin, it might not be long before we see a bull run that gives early $BTCBULL investors a hefty return. Visit the official $BTCBull website now, or find out more in our How to Buy BTC Bull Token guide. Meme coins – exciting or daunting? If you lean to the latter, we may have something that could convert you – Meme Index ($MEMEX). Often, crazy crypto like meme coins can be perceived as too risky for cautious investors, but $MEMEX helps manage that risk through the good ol’ stock market trick of diversification. The first decentralized meme coin index, $MEMEX has four unique indexes, each containing a basket of meme coins assembled to your specific risk profile. This lets you spread your investment across a number of coins, simply by holding just the $MEMEX token. These include: Leveraging the indexes, all the leg work is taken out of meme coin investing – you choose the risk level you want and then sit back and let the index do the work for you. As a possible recession looms, $MEMEX could be your safest way to invest in some of the best meme coins today and profit even through the dips. Visit the official $MEMEX website for more. PancakeSwap Token ($CAKE) has shown periods of strong performance recently, indicating growing interest in the PancakeSwap platform. This, together with token burning, may have helped increase its value of late. Its current price is $2.417, up 47.78% in the last seven days. Could it keep this up if a recession becomes a reality? Also behind the token’s popularity is the fact holders get access to the PancakeSwap DEX, which is the dominant DEX on the BNB Chain. CoinGecko lists PancakeSwap in the top trading DEXs ranked by 24-hour trading volume. The platform has a healthy $1.9B+ Total Valued Locked (TVL). This indicates significant capital invested within the ecosystem, signifying a high degree of user trust and confidence. If a recession does indeed come to pass and Robbie Mitchnick is right about the correlation between recession markers and bullish Bitcoin performance, we should see a positive trend across the crypto market as a whole. Taking advantage of this and getting in early with exciting new crypto like $BTCBULL or $MEMEX could be a smart move, especially if a positive turn is imminent. Just a friendly reminder: we’re not financial advisors. Do your own research before investing in anything. Crypto is risky, so only put in what you’re comfortable potentially losing, as there are no guarantees of positive returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Top Altcoins to 100x as Trump to Speak at Digital Asset Summit Tonight
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/top-altcoins-to-100x-as-trump-to-speak-at-digital-asset-summit-tonight/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T14:54:33Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump will address the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) to be held in New York at North Javits on March 20, making him the first sitting US president to do so. There has been a lot of speculation on what Trump will say. Will he jack up his pro-crypto stance and make better legislative promises for the crypto industry? If yes, this could then be the perfect time to buy some of the top altcoins and meme coins. This speech comes almost a week after Trump signed an executive order to form a Bitcoin reserve, where the US government will slowly build a pool of $BTC over the years. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have also laid down proposals to acquire 1M Bitcoins in the next five years. Besides Trump’s historic keynote, Michael Saylor (executive chairman of MicroStrategy) will also address the summit and have a discussion with Pete Rizzo, a popular Bitcoin historian. There’ll also be extensive discussion on Bitcoin ETFs involving Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, and Giang Bui, Nasdaq’s head of U.S. equities & exchange-traded products. Ever since the appointment of Trump as the president, several pro-crypto decisions have been made. Several ETF applications, including those based on $LTC, $XRP and $DOGE, have been lodged. Plus, altcoins and meme coins received a much-needed push thanks to the launch of the $TRUMP token. And, of course, Bitcoin continued to remain crypto’s centerpiece with the launch of the new reserve. All in all, the time is just right to make some prudent crypto investments. If you’re also looking for potential digital asset investments, here are some cryptocurrencies you just cannot miss. A potential boost to crypto by Trump is likely to result in a Bitcoin rally. The OG crypto, which has been sideways for a while, could finally surge and break all recent resistance levels. If you want to ride Bitcoin’s growth but without spending a fortune, then BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is undoubtedly the best crypto to invest in. $BTCBULL token holders will receive free $BTC as and when Bitcoin crosses new milestones ($150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond) for the first time. Just make sure you buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to be eligible for the rewards. It’s also worth noting that $BTCBULL can generate exponentially higher returns than Bitcoin itself. Is BTC Bull Token, then, the next crypto to explode? Possibly. Grab one of the top trending cryptos for just $0.00242 per token. The project has so far amassed over $3.8M, which is proof of its promise. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token. Solaxy ($SOLX) will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana. This makes it a unique (and potentially incredibly profitable) crypto, seeing as it has been designed for the betterment of the Solana blockchain. What’s aching Solana, you ask? The rapid rise of meme coins on the network has slowed it down significantly. It has been failing to accommodate the increased number of investors, and has, therefore, been throwing up congestion and scalability issues, including failed transactions. A multi-chain token, Solaxy plans to use a sidechain to process Solana’s transactions. This will reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet. Additionally, Solaxy will bundle multiple transactions into a single package, thereby offering investors lower fees, as well as faster execution and ease of use. The $SOLX presale is easily among the hottest crypto presales going around. With more than $27M in its presale purse at the time of writing, it’s currently offering one token for a low price of $0.001668. Here’s how to buy Solaxy. Although OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) has been under some serious selling pressure for the past few weeks, it’s up 1.28% today – and nearly 6% in the last seven days. As anticipation builds for the POTUS’ upcoming speech, $TRUMP could offer a great buying opportunity. It’s currently trading at $11.45. Experts believe the token is available at a huge discount and is, therefore, one of the best cheap altcoins to buy right now. The biggest reason for a bullish outlook on $TRUMP is Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. From his installing crypto-friendly personalities in top regulatory bodies like the SEC to his announcing a National Crypto Reserve, there’s no questioning Trump’s love for crypto. It’s also worth noting that $TRUMP has a short but promising history. Soon after its launch, it gained over 12,000% in just a few hours. An unprecedented interest from investors has made $TRUMP the fourth biggest crypto in the world. Currently, it has a market cap of over $2.2B. With the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) just hours away, we’d want our readers not to get carried away. FOMO is the killer of all portfolios, after all. Mix caution with aggression, which includes investing a small amount and diversifying your portfolio with multiple cryptos. Also, it’s crucial you do your own research before investing.

Title: Bitcoin To Align With Wall Street? BlackRock Predicts A Price Shift Ahead

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A BlackRock executive anticipates that the price of Bitcoin will increase in accordance with its growing institutional adoption. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock chief of digital assets, stated that Bitcoin remains 15% above its early November levels, despite recent price declines. He raised this point during an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. He believes that the cryptocurrency’s current value does not accurately reflect the number of significant institutions that are currently purchasing it. The market has not yet caught up to reality, he stated in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Mitchnick anticipates that the flagship crypto’s value will experience substantial growth once prices are in accordance with this institutional interest. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets says #Bitcoin’s Institutional adoption still isn’t reflected in the price. The new marketing team is here 🙌 pic.twitter.com/EZHP1uFYX5 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 19, 2025 United States President Donald Trump recently issued an executive order that established a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Numerous market observers anticipated that this would result in an instantaneous surge in crypto prices. In contrast, the cryptocurrency’s value has declined since the announcement. Mitchnick elucidated this discrepancy by asserting that individuals anticipated early substantial outcomes from these market developments. Premature expectations regarding the speed at which these favorable factors would influence prices were present, he stated. The BlackRock executive proposed that the market requires additional time to completely respond to these developments. Even as Bitcoin prices fluctuate, BlackRock has been exerting significant effort to encourage additional financial institutions and wealth managers to invest in its product. Mitchnick asserts that these endeavors are yielding results. Major financial institutions, such as Barclays, JPMorgan, and Avenir Group, now possess substantial quantities of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which monitors Bitcoin’s price, according to recent filings. During the recent market uncertainty, Mitchnick attributed the lack of stability in Bitcoin to perception rather than actuality when asked why it has not been as stable as gold. He characterized Bitcoin’s recent association with risky assets as “self-inflicted,” a consequence of market observers’ persistent designation of it as a risk-on asset. His analysis indicates that Bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics should cause it to move in opposition to market risks, akin to gold. Meanwhile, Mitchnick disclosed that Bitcoin may actually benefit from a recession. He enumerated a number of economic downturns that are well-suited to Bitcoin’s characteristics, including increased government expenditure, reduced interest rates, stimulus money, and concerns regarding social stability.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Tokenization Revolution: Transforming Global Finance And Challenges Ahead
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chris-perry/2025/03/20/tokenization-revolution-transforming-global-finance-and-challenges-ahead/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T13:00:00Z

ByChris Perry ByChris Perry , Contributor. There is a revolution in tokenization of digital assets. Is your business onboard? Imagine a world where financial transactions occur instantly, assets traverse the globe with seamless efficiency, and every investor, regardless of stature, gains unfettered access to markets with confidence in the identity of their counterparty, previously out of reach. This is not a distant fantasy but a rapidly emerging reality, spearheaded by the projection that $30 trillion worth of assets could be tokenized by 2030. Across the banking spectrum, behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are paving the way with the tokenization of deposits. They are introducing proprietary stablecoins to fortify settlement processes and alleviate the complexities associated with foreign exchange. By implementing these technologies, these banks have successfully dispelled doubts regarding blockchain's scalability and streamlined operations, delivering significant new value to clients. Fintech leaders are also at the forefront of the tokenization movement. For example, my firm, Broadridge, launched a revolutionary platform for the repo market last year. The platform enhances liquidity through tokenizing repurchase agreements, facilitating an average of $2 trillion in on-chain transactions every month. These innovations reduce settlement times and bolster liquidity, illustrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology. In the realm of asset management, industry trailblazers such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree are venturing into on-chain infrastructures for specific money markets and mutual funds. This paradigm shift is reminiscent of the success experienced with bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds this year, generating palpable market excitement and robust growth prospects. It's conceivable that trillions of dollars could soon flow through this novel infrastructure, amplifying efficiency and accessibility in financial markets. Tokenization isn’t confined to conventional finance; it extends its reach into alternative assets, ranging from real estate and private credit to artwork and private placements. Private equity titans like KKR and Hamilton Lane are redefining accessibility by issuing tokenized on-chain private equity funds, drastically lowering investment minimums. This new approach opens traditionally exclusive markets to a broader pool of retail investors, enhancing liquidity and fostering market democratization. Tokenization's influence is palpable even beyond the financial realm. For instance, California recently initiated a program to tokenize the titles of over 50 million registered cars, enabling owners to transfer ownership in one seamless step. Initiatives like these highlight the broader applicability and transformative potential of tokenization across various sectors. As these technologies continue reshaping global finance, collaboration with regulators will be pivotal. Digital assets are not necessarily like traditional assets. Sometimes there is no “issuer” on the hook for providing reliable information about the asset. Product developers, solution providers and regulators must work together to find ways to ensure investors access to comprehensive, standardized information about digital to be better informed. Creating safeguards like this will be essential to protect investors and markets as this transformation unfolds. The question is not whether this financial evolution will happen—it's already underway—but rather how we, as global stakeholders, can guide it responsibly and beneficially. For example, the tokenized future will not be confined to regional exchanges; instead, it will thrive on global platforms enabled by decentralized models offering real-time settlement at a fraction of traditional costs. The opportunity for policymakers to craft regulations that marry innovation with protection is immense, ensuring the market evolves in sync with technological advancements. The decisions made today by policymakers and industry leaders will indelibly shape how this transformation unfolds and ultimately benefit future generations of investors. The stakes are high and the call to action is clear: Embrace innovation while implementing robust regulatory frameworks that protect investor interests and aid in global financial growth. As the blockchain technology underpinning this revolution continues to bridge the gap between traditional and modern financial systems, the responsibility is on us to shepherd this transformation responsibly, ensuring greater choice for investors, greater efficiencies in raising capital and greater transparency in financial markets. The future of finance is being built before our eyes. The mission for global stakeholders—comprising regulators, innovators and investors—is to steer this evolution toward a future that is equitable and accessible, reflecting the best of what the tokenization revolution can offer. As we navigate this new frontier, the fusion of strategic vision and thoughtful governance will determine its success, charting a course for a financial landscape that thrives on innovation and provides investors with even greater choices.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd., has reached a preliminary agreement with Allianz SE to form an insurance business in India, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as the German insurer agreed earlier this week to sell its stake in joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. Both Jio and Allianz are in the process of finalizing the ownership structure, said the people who asked not to be identified as the matter is confidential. Allianz is aiming for a majority stake, but if that is not feasible, it is open to securinggovernance rights with a path to taking control in the future, according to one of the people. Jio and Allianz are seeking a tie-up for both health and general insurance. The agreement has yet to be finalized and is subject to change. Read more: Allianz to Sell India JV Stake to Local Partner for €2.6 Billion There was no immediate response from Jio Financial to a query sent by Bloomberg News, while a spokeswoman for Allianz declined comment.

Nvidia is reportedly planning a significant investment in semiconductor production and electronic components within the US. Over the next four years, total spending is expected to reach approximately $500bn, according to reporting by the Financial Times. Huang, in an interview with the publication, indicated that a substantial portion of this investment could be directed towards domestic chip production. He suggested that the Trump administration may play a role in accelerating the growth of the AI industry in the US by supporting manufacturing initiatives. Nvidia has been addressing investor concerns about continued demand for its high-cost AI chips, particularly amid increased competition. This follows the launch of a chatbot by China’s DeepSeek, which reportedly operates with fewer AI chips, raising questions about potential shifts in the AI hardware market. Huang has confirmed that Nvidia’s latest AI systems can now be manufactured in the US through partnerships with major suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn. He noted that TSMC’s investment in US-based manufacturing represents a significant step towards strengthening supply chain resilience, reducing dependency on overseas production, and ensuring steady access to critical semiconductor components. The company’s expansion strategy comes at a time of heightened global competition in the AI sector, particularly from Chinese technology firms. Nvidia has acknowledged Huawei’s growing influence in the market, underscoring the need for continuous investment in advanced chip production and infrastructure to maintain its leadership position. At the company’s developer conference in California on Wednesday, Huang told analysts that demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips could be significantly higher than current projections. He noted that orders for 3.6 million units from four major cloud firms underestimated overall market demand, as they did not account for purchases from Meta Platforms, smaller cloud providers, or AI-focused startups. Beyond manufacturing, Nvidia is expanding its role in AI infrastructure development through its participation in the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). The consortium, which includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX, aims to drive investment in AI-ready data centres and energy infrastructure. Initially, AIP plans to unlock $30bn in capital, with total investment potential reaching $100bn when including debt financing. Nvidia will continue to serve as a technical advisor to AIP, leveraging its expertise in AI computing and data centre infrastructure. The initiative is expected to foster collaboration across a diverse network of investors, corporations, and technology firms, focusing on scalable AI solutions. AIP’s investments will be primarily directed toward the US and partner countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Last month, Nvidia forecasted revenue of approximately $43bn for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, surpassing market expectations. The company expects gross margins to be around 70.6%, with operating expenses estimated at $5.2bn on a GAAP basis. It also anticipates additional income of approximately $400m, excluding gains and losses from equity securities. Give your business an edge with our leading Tech Monitor

Title: Buyout Firm CVC Eyes US Private Credit in Expansion Drive

CVC Capital Partners Plc has identified private credit in the US as an area for potential acquisitions, according to Chief Executive Officer Rob Lucas. There are “huge opportunities” for CVC in private wealth and insurance business, Lucas said during a media call on Thursday after the company posted its full-year earnings . “We have consistently said that if the right opportunity to build our business inorganically, arises, then we are very open to that and we will look carefully at those opportunities,” Lucas said. “We have in the past identified US private credit as as one of those areas.” Bloomberg News reported this week that CVC is interested in acquiring Fortress Investment Corp. and has held talks with Fortress and majority owner, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co., though discussions aren’t active at the moment. CVC had also expressed interest in a potential combination with HPS Investment Partners before BlackRock Inc. agreed to buy HPS in a $12 billion all-stock deal in December. Insurance business is another focus of growth for CVC, which has raised more than €15 billion of capital from insurance clients over the past five years. Insurers are keen to tie up with private markets operators to help manage the assets on their balance sheets, according to Fred Watt, CVC’s chief financial officer. “It’s something we look at,” Watt said. “We’re well placed to do that and we can see why insurance companies are interested in in that sort of arrangement.” Market Dislocation CVC made €1.33 billion in management fees last year, beating analyst estimates of €1.23 billion, its latest earnings showed. Its assets under management totaled €200 billion at the end of 2024. The private equity firm said it has €40 billion of capital available to deploy across all its strategies. It expects “strong growth” in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2025. Shares of CVC rose as much as 4.8% Thursday, the most since Dec. 12. The stock has fallen about 7% this year, giving the company a market value of around €21 billion. Recent market volatility and geopolitical concerns have sapped dealmaking activity globally. Initial public offerings have slowed as well. The private equity owners of Stada Arzneimittel AG have decided to push back the German drugmaker’s IPO until September, Bloomberg News reported this week. German regional lender Oldenburgische Landesbank AG has abandoned plans for an IPO and will instead be sold to a subsidiary of France’s Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale. CVC, however, views volatility as an opportunity, according to Lucas. “We thrive in periods of change,” he said. ‘The last time, we saw something like this, I suppose would be in the market dislocations post the global financial crisis,” CVC’s Watt added. “I can think of many examples in those periods where we were one of the few buyers of assets. And we can see that happening as we speak.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Markus Winkler Tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters to meet AI-related energy demands Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft, investment fund MGX and BlackRock to expand AI infrastructure in the US, the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion (roughly Rs. 2,58,984 crore) in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after US President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle, with plans to mobilise up to $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,16,626 crore). Investors have committed $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore) for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium - which includes BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialised data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilise up to $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore), including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on US partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Panama ports deal: Who is billionaire Li Ka-shing? How did Hong Kong's richest man anger China?

United States President Donald Trump is reportedly “very pleased” with the sale of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings' Panama ports assets to a consortium that includes US investing giant BlackRock. Amid lashing from Chinese media for “disloyalty” and CK Hutchison's defence that the transaction was purely commercial in nature, we take a look at who Li Ka-shing is, and why Beijing is displeased and the significance of Li Ka-shing's Panama deal amid US-China tensions and Donald Trump's tariff wars. ‘Rags-to-riches’ business mogul,96-year-old Li Ka-shing built Hong Kong's prestigious CK Hutchison Holdings, according to an AP report. He is the richest man in the region and among the top 50 richest in the world according to Forbes. The publication puts his net worth at $38 billion. While Li retired from his post of Chairman in 2018 and was suceeded by his son, the billionaire, nicknamed “Superman” is still among the region's most influencial figures, the AP report added. He rose to prominence from the former British colony to expand interests in real estate, telecom, supermarkets and utilities. The company also operates Superdrug (British chemist franchise) and Three (European mobile network firm), the report added. Li is now in the spotlight since his company's deal (announced on March 4) to sell its subsidiaries' ports in the Panama Canal — an asset it had held since 1997. The biggest rub is that the buyer is a consortium that includes US investment firm BlackRock and comes while US President Donald Trump has accused China of interfearing in the Panama Canal. Li is not a stranger to Beijing's reach in Hong Kong — he was part of the committee that helped select the financial hub's new leader when it was brought under administrative control of China, the report said. The past week has seen local media outlets push criticism against the deal sourced to Beijing's local affairs office, the report noted. And while Chinese leaders acknowledge that support for local business tycoons can help preserve Hong Kong's capitalistic system, Li who has lent has influence, is not free from criticism. In 2015, Li faced accusations of “immorality” for selling assets in mainland China; then in 2019 during the pro-democracy protests some in Beijing were unhappy by his “percieved ambivalence”. Now in 2025, the Panama posts deal has opened a can of worms. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he would seize control of the Panama Canal, which is a key global trade channel. The ports held by CK Holdings are on each end of the Canal and strategically important. US-based BlackRock having some control over its operations has been music to Donald Trump's ears. But China is fuming. The nearly $23 billion deal, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. In its commentary, a Beijing-backed newspaper termed the deal a “betrayal of all Chinese” and asked to company to choose a side and warned against “dance with” US politicians. AP cited some local reports say that Chinese leaders were also angered about not being consulted before the deal was made, given that ports are a strategic asset and make for sensitive transactions on a good day. At present it is unclear whether China will pull the plug on this deal and the country's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about investigations into the matter. Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy, told the agency that cancelling the deal now would be risky. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said. Longer term, while Li could try to make good with Chinese leaders, and use the money from the deal for investments in the mainland, relations between companies and the government may still be rough, the report noted. "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the Panama deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals. The situation shows that Washington’s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid. This is bad when it comes to the defense of ‘one country, two systems,’” George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm told AP.
