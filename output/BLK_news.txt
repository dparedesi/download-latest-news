Watch CBS News Updated on: October 17, 2025 / 4:52 PM EDT / CBS News Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project. Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through. Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert. Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News. Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors "mobbed" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event. Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either. But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed — and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing. Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom — even if they're powerless to stop its construction. California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it. CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure. "This is the White House — it's an emblem of our nation," Takano told CBS News. "It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace." Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction. Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message. The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from "his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care," Takano said. Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. "For me, it's like – I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with." Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm. Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a "world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," according to a company statement. An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said. The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has "definitely expanded," and its exact square footage is "not yet settled," according to a source familiar with the layout. It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase. The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given. CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests. The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. "We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network. The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials. Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House. A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News the White House and National Park Service are responsible for construction and design. So far, the Trust has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said. According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement. The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial. In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different. "Small, medium and large," Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. "I happen to think the large looks by far the best." Here's the full list of invitees to Mr. Trump's dinner: More than 100 were invited to President Trump's dinner Wednesday night, which was meant to thank financial donors who are funding the new White House ballroom. Those invited, including some who couldn't attend, according to CBS sources, were: Kathryn Watson contributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Today’s top news: It’s been a long-standing joke: “Are the sellers in the room with us?” Well, it turns out: Yes, indeed they are. According to JPMorgan, the sharp crypto correction last week in crypto and carrying through this week was largely self-inflicted. In a note to clients, the bank said the sell pressure came from crypto-native investors, not institutions. The data backs that up: While open interest on Binance and other offshore venues cratered, CME’s institutional contracts barely moved. It’s very much a tale of two markets. Regarding on-chain crypto, the more than $19 billion in liquidations that slammed the crypto market on Friday have tremendously impacted sentiment and prices, neither of which have yet to recover. Glassnode shows nearly $12 billion in futures open interest evaporated overnight, the biggest single-day decline in dollar terms ever. Yet, institutional flow looks calm. The ETFs have seen steady inflows through the turbulence. Across the past two weeks: CME’s Bitcoin open interest held steady, ETF outflows were minor, and Coinbase volumes even ticked up, suggesting that institutional money (smart money) mostly watched from the sidelines. This was the crypto casino cleaning itself out, not TradFi calling it quits. The institutions have mostly still been buying through the pain —so who has been selling? Answer: ancient whales and 4-year cycle believers. There’s plenty of data showing the amount of Bitcoin sold this year from those ancient whales, many of whom were up billions. They said they were going to dump their coins on Wall St., and then they did. And then one of the biggest anecdotal takeaways from the Asia crypto conference tour last month was that many Asian whales still believe in the 4-year cycle, and fully planned on selling this year aligned with prior cycles. While this has put us in a painful spot, there are reasons to be optimistic. Couple those reasons along with the recent on-chain leverage flushout and you have a nice foundation to set up a healthier base for the next leg upwards—not to mention the prospective gold-to-Bitcoin rally that typically takes place when gold leads (and boy, is it leading right now). So stay the course, bulls—this too shall pass.

Title: Is BlackRock About To Go Public With Ripple And XRP? Here’s What We Know

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are circulating that BlackRock has partnered with Ripple to tokenize real-world assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). There has been no confirmation from either party, suggesting that these rumors may not be accurate. In an X post, XRP influencer JackTheRippler said that there are rumors that BlackRock is about to announce a partnership with Ripple to tokenize assets on the XRPL. Other XRP influencers, such as CryptoSensei and Bale, also shared the rumor, sparking excitement among XRP community members. However, BlackRock and Ripple have yet to issue an official announcement about the rumored partnership, suggesting these claims may not be true. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink confirmed that they are building their own technology to tokenize several of their funds and expand their crypto offerings. The BlackRock CEO noted that tokenization can help crypto-native investors access more traditional assets. He further remarked that if they could tokenize an ETF, they could get these investors into the more traditional long-term retirement products. Notably, the asset manager already has products, such as its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which runs on the Ethereum network. It is worth mentioning that Ripple already partnered with the fund’s manager, Securitize, to enable off-ramp support for BlackRock’s BUIDL using their RLUSD stablecoin. This has so far been the closest to a partnership between Ripple and BlackRock amid rumors that the asset manager plans to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. However, Ripple has so far helped advance upgrades to the XRP Ledger, which could compel institutions like BlackRock to tokenize their funds on the XRPL. This has included the launch of the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which is designed to simplify the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). While rumors of a Ripple and BlackRock partnership do not appear to be accurate, there are other recent developments that provide a bullish outlook for XRP. This includes Ripple’s expansion into the corporate treasury markets through the $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a provider of treasury management systems. As part of the deal, Ripple and GTreasury will focus on enabling customers to carry out real-time cross-border payments using Ripple’s payment solution, in which XRP serves as the bridge currency. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Ripple is also working to raise up to $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury company. The crypto firm plans to contribute some of its XRP holdings to set up the firm, while the proposed $1 billion is expected to be raised through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Fresh U.S. Office Conversion Fund Nears $1B in Investments
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/office-conversion-fund-peebles-mcneely/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:57:02Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If you build it, they will come — unless it’s stale office space. In Manhattan, for example, the office vacancy rate hovers at a high of between 13 and 14 percent — nearly doubling the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 — while apartments come with sky-high rents and spark bidding wars, creating a perfect storm for a switch-up. According to recent Cushman & Wakefield data, the pace of New York’s office-to-residential conversions has probably never been faster (or at least it’s close to that milestone). Enter another major player intent on capitalizing on the trend. In April, developer Don Peebles of the Peebles Corporation and Doug McNeely, previously a partner at BlackRock and at Carlyle, announced the Donahue Douglas asset management firm: a $1.5 billion venture to buy offices in New York and elsewhere in the U.S. to convert into housing or hospitality. Office-to-residential conversions are not a new phenomenon, but the national scale of Donahue Douglas marks a major shift from firms or funds focused on a single conversion project or one specific region. “Most of my entire career has been focused on developing cities,” said Peebles. “We’re not going to go to New York City or Washington, D.C., and buy one building; we’re committing to these markets.” Together, McNeely and Peebles plan to buy and transform office buildings across U.S. cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Boston. The fund could spur at least $4.5 billion in apartment redevelopment, creating roughly 15,000 housing units, said Peebles. Additionally, Donahue Douglas is launching an emerging developer fund, with hopes to eventually employ minority developers for office conversion projects. “This is a long-term business for us,” said McNeely, “The secular headwinds that exist in office space right now, with structural shifts post-COVID, have created a real generational opportunity to invest in this space.” Since the pandemic, thousands of vacated office buildings have undergone makeovers, transforming into much-needed housing complexes. The United States reported a lineup of 55,300 office-to-residential units last year, with some 70,700 conversions planned for 2025, according to Yardi Matrix data. In New York City, notable office-to-residential conversion projects include the historic Emmet Building at 95 Madison Avenue and the Financial District’s newly opened 25 Water Street, the country’s largest conversion of its kind. Outside of New York City, developers from Detroit to Boston are seeking new opportunities in old buildings. These opportunities have ripple effects. “Putting capital and repositioning these buildings either turns around a neighborhood or prevents the neighborhood from ever facing issues with dark and vacant buildings and storefronts,” said Jeremy Shell, a principal with New York-based developer TF Cornerstone (who is not involved in the new fund). As of October, McNeely and Peebles were in the process of closing various commitments totaling nearly $1 billion of their planned $1.5 billion fund, said Peebles, who anticipates closing on that $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. Different investors have jumped on board, including large institutions such as state pension plans, as well as family offices, university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. Many institutional investors want to allocate significant funds between $100 million to $200 million each, said Peebles. Beyond any one investor, however, the fund has gained momentum by problem solving for the now. “In New York and many other markets, we have a housing crisis, and that is not only an affordable housing crisis — that is a general residential housing crisis,” said Shell. While many New Yorkers can anecdotally understand housing complaints, the statistics hammer home the point. Nationally, there’s a shortage of some 7 million affordable housing units and 4.5 million market-rate ones. In New York specifically, there’s little ground-up construction of multifamily apartments. Moreover, building costs have increased alongside spiking interest rates, inflation concerns and tariff uncertainties, said Shell. To address this staggering lag, state and local officials have enacted policies such as a major rezoning of Midtown South to incentivize office conversions, and a long-term property tax break known as 467-m. Such moves highlight a key player in pulling off large-scale office-to-residential conversions. “That’s really step one: the city getting behind creating or recreating these buildings,” said Andrew Barrocas, CEO of MNS Real Estate (who is also not involved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). But policy alone is not enough to pull off nationwide conversion projects. Rather, a workforce tax credit program and financial incentives are crucial to producing more housing. Tax credit programs allow Peebles and McNeely to create a range of housing, from affordable to higher-end luxury apartments, depending on each building, said Peebles. Meanwhile, Congress earlier this year modified the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, making the production of affordable housing more attractive to developers, and tax credits easier for them to use. The closure of all kinds of offices has exposed the potential for a fund like the one proposed by Peebles and McNeely. Empty offices in New York City have caused small businesses to shutter, while those in Downtown Washington, D.C., have created something of a ghost town, snowballing into vacant retail and the closure of small businesses. Washington, D.C., therefore tops the list of Donahue Douglas’ geographic points of interest, as the firm’s investment strategy focuses on large, major markets; strong, solid underlying fundamentals; significant distress; and entrepreneurial opportunities, said Peebles. “No. 2, we really see San Francisco as an environment of great opportunity,” said Peebles, who pinpointed the city’s politics and focus on crime and quality of life issues. He additionally cited Dallas, Austin, South Florida and Boston as areas with major conversion potential. Replacing offices with apartments can revive neighborhoods and create more vibrant, vital, economically resilient and equitable places, said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. Across neighborhoods, Peebles and McNeely plan to purchase a combination of both healthy buildings and those under significant duress, said McNeely. Some of these offices will be more bare-bones buildings at the end of their physical and economic lives, while others will be newer skyscrapers that have lost their tenants. Peebles doesn’t consider New York City among Donahue Douglas’ top five cities. But its neighborhoods still present opportunities for both conversions and ground-up development projects through Donahue Douglas’ emerging developer fund. “Our business strategy will be the real estate investment strategy of the future,” said Peebles. “The institutional investors and institutional developers have proven that they can never meet the needs of the public when it comes to housing. … There’s a demand for a new class of developers and investors, and capital to go to them.” As for the New York City areas well positioned to benefit from office-to-residential changes? Barrocas singled out business-heavy neighborhoods like Midtown East and Midtown West. Neighborhoods like the Financial District, Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn are similarly prime for conversion projects. In Midtown, the Garment District is likewise ripe for office-to-residential changes, said Kaplan. Not only is the area accessible to the subway, but it also has loft-type buildings that are relatively easy to transform into apartments. Sure, the neighborhood is missing green spaces, said Kaplan, but those residential aspects are likely to arise after housing arrives. After all, “it’s faster to convert than it is to build new,” said Kaplan. Meaning, converting buildings can — and likely will — revive neighborhoods more efficiently than new construction. (Another bonus: Conversions are also the more sustainable option, as concrete and steel are major sources of embedded carbon.) For proof, take Manhattan’s Financial District circa the 1990s. Back then, the neighborhood was predominantly offices. After an early 2000s recession and the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the values of those office properties declined. Plus, city zoning reforms in the previous decade — among tax incentives and lower-priced office buildings — spurred the conversion of larger offices, said Francis Greenburger, CEO and founder of Time Equities (and uninvolved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). “When you have vacant storefronts, vacant buildings, less pedestrian traffic around these buildings and neighborhoods, there’s risk of this downward spiral, and we’ve seen it,” said Shell, whose TF Cornerstone was responsible for various FiDi conversions. Once housing moved into the Financial District, so did shops, cafes and restaurants to feed and entertain those new residents. Neighborhood residents require everything from garbage pickup to quieter streets, as well as supermarkets, restaurants and cultural venues. “It takes a long time for the locations to provide the sort of infrastructure that residential tenants want,” said Greenburger, who believes the trend of conversions could potentially taper off within the next two to three years, once suitable office buildings are all scooped up. “Changing the office buildings isn’t the entire equation.” Nor is doing away with workspaces altogether. “As it pertains to New York City, we’re being very innovative,” said McNeely. “So, we’re going to couple conversions with smart working spaces. [We will] take 21st-century working spaces, where people are going to be very interested in not only living in the building, but also taking part in the neighborhood. We really want to focus on not only the building, but the amenities within and surrounding the building.” Anna Staropoli can be reached at astaropoli@commercialobserver.com.

The withdrawal contributed to a brutal Thursday across Bitcoin ETFs, which collectively bled $530.9 million, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock's IBIT lost $29.5 million, Fidelity's FBTC dropped $132 million, and Grayscale's GBTC shed $45 million, pointing to a broad institutional retreat from Bitcoin exposure. The week proved punishing for Bitcoin products overall, with $858.7 million in net outflows and only Tuesday breaking the exodus with a single day of inflows. The exodus comes as markets continue to absorb shocks from President Donald Trump's 100% tariff announcement on China last Friday, which triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. China on Thursday nodded openness to trade talks while accusing the U.S. of creating "panic" over Beijing's rare earth export controls, offering a potential off-ramp as both nations work toward a planned meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. "There is a short-medium term shift, especially post the comments on last Friday towards a more risk-off state, especially given market exuberance across risk assets and uncorrelated assets over the last few months," Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. The combination of the Ethereum-based USDe stablecoin’s depeg on Friday and a social media-driven boycott movement against Binance has pushed concerns about systemic risk back into focus, particularly at this stage of the post-halving Bitcoin cycle, he added. Despite managing just 50,000 BTC versus BlackRock's 800,000 and Fidelity's 210,000, ARKB "is generally one of the funds leading the charge" on outflow days, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, told Decrypt, adding how "ARK's holdings have held consistently in the 40-50K BTC since March 2024." ARK's fund sees "investors more frequently rotate in and out of BTC as a speculative asset" compared to BlackRock and Fidelity's vehicles, which house longer-term holders, he said. Whether the Bitcoin ETF outflow streak continues depends on upcoming catalysts, particularly the Federal Reserve's October 29 FOMC meeting and the ongoing Q3 earnings season, Mahidhar said. “Market exuberance needs to be supported by revenue and cash flow growth in U.S. markets — if that happens and the FOMC meeting goes well, we may see a staunching in the bleed out,” he noted. Bitcoin is trading at $104,629, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, still nursing losses from the tariff-triggered crash.

Title: BlackRock Plans Tokenization as IBIT Surpasses $100B in AUM and $HYPER’s Presale Reaches $23.9M

Time Published: 2025-10-17T09:02:28Z
Full Content:
Quick Facts: 1️⃣ BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT surpassed $100B less than two years after its release on January 11, 2024. 2️⃣ Larry Fink announced a long-term plan to tokenize all assets, from funds to stocks and cash. 3️⃣ Fink argues that bubbles don’t impact long-term investors and that time in the market outweighs opportunistic buy-ins. 4️⃣ Bitcoin’s Layer 2 project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) reaches $23.9M in presale and eyes a Q1 2026 release. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) just surpassed $100B in assets under management (AUM), which prompted CEO Larry Fink to announce the company’s tokenization plans. Fink made the comments during a CNBC interview, where he said: I do believe we’re just at the beginning of tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board. —Larry Fink, CNBC Interview This comes over a year and a half after BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, on the Ethereum network by partnering with Securitize. In the official press release, Securitize’s co-founder and CEO, Carlos Domingo, said that BUIDL proves that tokenization is essentially unstoppable and that it will transform the capital market. With over $1T in AUM, BlackRock’s decision to invest in tokenization tech stems from Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s success, especially amid 2025’s rampant adoption wave. This spells good news for Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $23.9M presale which feeds Bitcoin’s coming Layer 2 with a projected Q1 2026 public launch. Fink believes that asset tokenization is imminent and the key step to attracting digital investors into the TradFi market, which pack more unpopular products like retirement funds. The overarching goal is to allow investors to hold multiple assets together, including funds, cash, and cryptos, which would represent a turning point for the capital market as a whole. To that end, Fink pushes for ‘time in the market,’ as opposed to opportunistic buy-ins, as an anti-bubble strategy. As he sees it, it’s only opportunistic buyers who push the notion of financial bubbles due to their short time in the market. This doesn’t happen with long-term investors who ride the bubbles to follow the larger trend. If you put money to work on January 1st, 2000, a year later you had the Dot Com crysis, six years later you had the financial crisis, you had the COVID crysis; you still would’ve made 8% compound interest over the entire 25 years. It’s not about if our markets are going up or down […] it’s about being in the market for the entire cycle. —Larry Fink, CNBC interview The same mindset applies to the digital market and Bitcoin is the living proof of that. While opportunistic snipers often find themselves in hot waters – last Friday’s market crash anyone? – long-term investors who bought $BTC in 2011 are now up 169,000,000%. Bitcoin’s recent performance only adds to that. $BTC now trades at just under $106K after a 13.7% drop over the last week, which is painful for leverage traders, but neutral for long-term investors, because Bitcoin will eventually bounce back. Especially with Bitcoin Hyper just around the corner. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address Bitcoin’s most pressing problem: its performance limitation. With a hard cap of seven transactions per second (TPS), Bitcoin currently ranks 22nd on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS. This translates to slow confirmation times, high fees, and lack of scalability. Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to change that. Once the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms incoming transactions in milliseconds, the Bridge then mints the bitcoins on the Hyper layer, allowing you to use the wrapped assets with near-instant finality within the Layer 2 ecosystem. Long-term, Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a more feasible option for institutional investors by making the network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. The project is seeing outstanding investor support, managing to reach $23.9M since its beginning and it’s still growing fast. $HYPER is available right now at the presale price of $0.013125, which could be the lowest you could ever buy the token at.

Title: AIP, MGX, BlackRock’s GIP consortium to buy Aligned for $40bn

Time Published: 2025-10-17T08:50:17Z

A consortium consisting of the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), MGX, and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers for an enterprise value of around $40bn. The deal will help increase the scale of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Aligned’s current owners Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) and its co-investment partners will sell their entire equity stake. In an interview with Reuters, MAM head Ben Way said the sale “was not a warning sign for the sector or AI”. Way was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We don’t own businesses in perpetuity, we have owned this for seven years and it’s at a great spot to exit and there’s clearly massive demand to exit.” The acquisition is AIP’s first investment as it pursues its goal to deploy $30bn in equity capital, with a longer-term target that could reach $100bn when including debt. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Aligned Data Centers operates hyperscale and enterprise data centres and currently manages a portfolio of 50 campuses and over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Its facilities are located in major digital gateway regions in the US and Latin America, including Chicago, Dallas, Northern Virginia, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Queretaro. Aligned will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and its current executive team from its Dallas headquarters following acquisition. Schaap said: “Partnering with the consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data centre infrastructure.” Since Macquarie Asset Management’s initial investment in 2018 via Macquarie Infrastructure Partners IV, and an increased stake through Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V in 2020, Aligned has expanded from two facilities with 85MW of capacity to its current scale. The company introduced both green securitisation and sustainability-linked financing models to the data centre sector during this period. The acquisition is intended to provide Aligned with capital and resources required to expand its presence and meet demand for high-density, scalable compute infrastructure. The consortium’s investment brings operational experience across AI infrastructure deployment and management. AIP chairman and BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said: “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilising private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” Subject to regulatory clearance and standard closing requirements, the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026. AIP was established by BlackRock, GIP, MGX, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with the objective of scaling AI infrastructure capacity. The partnership’s primary financial backers include the Kuwait Investment Authority and Temasek.

Title: Bitcoin must upgrade or fall victim to quantum computing attack in 5 years
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4346872/posts
Time Published: 2025-10-17T04:30:56Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/16/2025 9:30:56 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Unless Bitcoin upgrades its core cryptography in the next five years, the trust it has built over 16 years could be wiped out by a single quantum attack. Urgent upgrades are needed to protect the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed how we define money. In response to the 2008 collapse of the financial institutions in which millions put their trust, Satoshi created a decentralized monetary system built on elliptic curve cryptography. This combination of cold math and decentralization was a powerful one, attracting not only diehard skeptics but also the world’s largest financial institutions, such as BlackRock. In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

In response to the 2008 collapse of the financial institutions in which millions put their trust, Satoshi created a decentralized monetary system built on elliptic curve cryptography. This combination of cold math and decentralization was a powerful one, attracting not only diehard skeptics but also the world’s largest financial institutions, such as BlackRock. In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

A MAN WHOSE skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine at the side of a road in Co Cork had sustained multiple fractures to his skull and body consistent with the use of a hammer like weapon, a murder trial has heard. The remains of Kieran Quilligan were discovered after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on 29 January, 2024. The 47 year old, who was from Togher in Cork city, was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) are on trial in the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork charged with his murder. Today the jury heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who attended at the scene where the remains of Mr Quilligan were found. Dr Bolster said that that on examination of the jute bag the first thing she saw was the pelvic bone protruding. The skull was separate from the body. She noted that there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster subsequently carried out a postmortem examination on Mr Quilligan on 30 January, 2024 at Cork University Hospital. Advertisement She said that a cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, Dr Bolster stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, femur, knee, skull and face. Dr Bolster said that there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word ‘Mother’ and a date. A further inscription was illegible. Meanwhile, the jury of ten men and two women also heard evidence today that one of the accused men, Niall Long, had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. The message was sent after she texted him saying that the jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt Maurice O’Connor said that Mr Long texted his mother back and said that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The case continues tomorrow in front of Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and the jury. The prosecution in the case claim that the accused men killed Mr Quilligan in a “joint enterprise.” The charge facing both accused is that the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long previously of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork and and Luke Taylor formerly of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in the city both deny murdering Mr Quilligan.

Title: Fractures of skeletal remains suggest victim suffered severe assault, murder trial hears

A 47-year-old man whose skeletal remains were found more than five months after he went missing suggest he suffered multiple fractures to bones in his head, face and torso, a murder trial heard on Thursday. Kieran Quilligan had suffered a significant assault with some blunt implement such as a hammer, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster told the trial of co-accused Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Both Mr Long, of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Mr Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, have denied the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024. On Thursday, Dr Bolster told the jury of 10 men and two women that she conducted a postmortem on the skeletal remains of Mr Quilligan, which had been found by a cadaver dog under a jute bag in scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, in east Cork on January 29th, 2024. She was not able to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died nor was she able to give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem. Dr Bolster revealed that Mr Quilligan had both old, healed fractures as well as more recent newer fractures and the latter included fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jaw bone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. “Fractures don’t cause death, it is usually trauma to underlying organs, but I could not establish the cause of death because there were no organs left,” said Dr Bolster, as she explained the lack of tissue and organs also meant she could not carry out any toxicology tests on Mr Quilligan. Cross-examined by Brendan Grehan SC for Mr Taylor, she agreed if Mr Quilligan had been shot in the head, there would be evidence of this in his skull and similarly a stab wound to the torso could leave marks on bones, but she found no evidence of either on his skeletal remains. Dr Bolster said that several of Mr Quilligan’s fractures, including one to his jaw and one to his thigh bone, were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all, they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”. She said she believed two pieces of knotted plastic found tied around Mr Quilligan’s neck area were unusual ligatures and were more likely used to lift the remains. She also believed that a ratchet type cable tying his legs together was also used to lift and move the remains. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor of how he seized a number of mobile phones as part of the investigation, including one from Mr Long’s home at St Michael’s Close on September 15th, 2023. Gardaí were able to retrieve texts sent and received by the phones. He said he found a message on the phone seized at St Michael’s Close which belonged to Mr Long’s mother, Janice, sent on 6.23pm on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she had noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her Toyota Rav car. Sgt O’Connor said that although gardaí were not able to locate the phone from which a reply was sent, they were able to establish the content of the message in which the sender admitted that there may have been a smell in the boot of Ms Long’s Toyota Rav jeep. “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned,” said the sender. The jury were earlier told they would hear evidence the accused used Ms Long’s jeep to transport Mr Qulligan’s body. The case continues.

Title: Florida introduces new bill to establish Bitcoin and digital asset reserves

Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:48:30Z

Share this article Florida has introduced a new bill that would authorize the state to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The legislation, filed as House Bill 183 and sponsored by Rep. Webster Barnaby, would allow the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the State Board of Administration to manage portions of state funds in Bitcoin and digital asset exchange-traded products. The move aligns with broader institutional adoption trends. The US established a strategic Bitcoin reserve managed by the Treasury in 2025, incorporating forfeited assets as a store of value. Institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity have expanded Bitcoin-related fund offerings, supporting the infrastructure that could facilitate state-level adoption. Recent policies allowing digital assets in retirement plans have created a precedent for Florida’s reserve strategy. The legislation represents Florida’s effort to position itself among states pioneering crypto asset integration into public investment frameworks, treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve option alongside traditional state fund allocations.

European stocks advanced on Thursday as investors took largely upbeat corporate earnings to heart amid easing political tensions after French prime minister Sébastien Lecornu survived a confidence vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.45 per cent. Wall Street stocks advanced and gold prices surged ever upward on Thursday as solid corporate earnings helped investors look past simmering trade tensions between the United States and China. All three major US stock indexes followed their European counterparts to modest gains, while safe-haven seekers continued to send gold to fresh highs DUBLIN Shares in mining company Kenmare Resources traded flat after a wobble in the previous session on back of statements production of ilmenite – it’s most important mineral – will be towards the lower end of guidance this year. Bank of Ireland closed marginally down by 0.54 per cent. Food group Glanbia and budget airline Ryanair rose upon the positive tide, closing the session up 1.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively. EUROPE In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed up 1.4 per cent, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.4 per cent. In France, prime minister Sébastien Lecornu weathered two confidence motions, just days after appointing his new government and making a key political concession to stay in power. The votes followed Mr Lecornu’s decision Tuesday to back suspending a divisive 2023 pension reform, in a bid to keep his cabinet afloat long enough to pass a much-needed austerity budget by year’s end. In Zurich, Nestle stormed 9.3 per cent higher after announcing plans to cut around 16,000 jobs globally over the next two years, as new chief executive officer Philipp Navratil steps up restructuring to revive growth and profitability at the Swiss food conglomerate. The move forms part of an expanded cost-savings programme. Nestle also reported third quarter organic growth of 4.3 per cent, well ahead of 3.7 per cent expected by analysts. Real internal growth improved to 1.5 per cent, ahead of 0.3 per cent consensus, recovering from negative trends earlier in the year. LONDON Blue chips in London nudged higher on Thursday despite sluggish economic growth in August and a 10 per cent drop for Premier Inn owner Whitbread. The FTSE 100 index was little changed at 9,436.09. The UK economy achieved only minor growth in August, numbers from the Office for National Statistics showed, while the reading for July was downwardly revised. Earlier this week, UK chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged she was looking at potential tax rises and spending cuts to fill a black hole in her budget. On the FTSE 100, Whitbread tumbled 10 per cent as lower earnings, higher debt, and growing economic uncertainty in the UK all weighed, despite a pickup in trading at Premier Inn. Whitbread said pretax profit fell 7.1 per cent to £287 million in the half-year that ended August 28 from £309 million a year earlier. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called Whitbread’s results “another weak performance”, saying that earnings in reverse and net debt on the rise is the “kind of news that makes investors suffer from insomnia”. NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed on Thursday, as financial companies dragged while chip stocks extended their rally following a strong quarterly update from TSMC that reinforced investor optimism around AI. Shares of some major US chipmakers also advanced, building on gains from Wednesday when ASML’s solid quarterly results and a $40 billion (€34 billion) data centre deal by BlackRock and a Nvidia-backed group fuelled optimism around AI. Nvidia rose 1 per cent, Micron Technology added 5.6 per cent and Broadcom gained 1.1 per cent. Salesforce rose 4.1 per cent as it forecast revenue of more than $60 billion for 2030, above Wall Street estimates. “The Nasdaq is having a pretty good day, being driven higher by the semiconductors and the software side of things,” said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. Among other moves, Hewlett Packard Enterprise slumped 10.5 per cent after it forecast annual profit and revenue below Wall Street expectations. JB Hunt shares jumped 19.3 per cent after a higher third-quarter profit. – Additional reporting by Reuters Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How CIOs Can Comply With International Data Privacy Laws
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2025/10/16/how-cios-can-comply-with-international-data-privacy-laws/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:19:02Z

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Governance is increasingly more important as cybersecurity risks grow in number, capabilities and scope, but even companies that have excellent governance in some areas might not be covering everything. A new report from data security platform Kiteworks found that several companies are failing at managed file transfer protection—and many of the vulnerabilities are relatively easy to identify and solve. Nearly six in 10 companies had a file transfer security incident in the last year, but priority is not placed on the steps to protect them. “Organizations check compliance boxes while missing fundamental governance,” Kiteworks Chief Strategy Officer Tim Freestone said in a statement. “They can’t tell you where sensitive files are stored, who accessed them last week, or how they move between systems. Without this visibility, even sophisticated security tools become expensive decorations.” Many enterprises are missing out on places to add security that don’t necessarily require new tools or knowhow, Kiteworks found. Three-quarters use end-to-end encryption for data that is in transit, but just 42% use an AES-256 encryption standard for data that is in storage, making it easier for bad actors to steal and exploit. Only about a third have integrated file transfer with their security team and its systems. And only a quarter test their file transferring security regularly. How can these holes be plugged? Kiteworks recommends companies stop buying new tools and instead come up with comprehensive data governance standards that cover files and transfers. This kind of governance is not just helpful from a security perspective, but it also helps enterprises keep better track of all of their data. Paying closer attention also helps identify where cybersecurity risks are lurking, enabling the enterprise to get ahead of threats, which is vital in today’s business environment. Another vital aspect of business is online privacy—a sometimes thorny topic because different states, countries and geopolitical zones have their own distinct sets of laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of data privacy platform Clarip, about how companies can stay in compliance everywhere and still do business. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. We are currently accepting nominations for the Forbes CIO Next 2025 list. We’re looking for innovators who have had significant impacts both at their own companies and for other tech leaders on the whole. (And yes, you can nominate yourself.) Nominations are accepted until 5 p.m. ET on October 30. It seems that 2025 is the year of the AI megadeal, and it’s getting difficult to keep track of who’s investing in or partnering with whom. Just this week, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure announced it will deploy AMD’s Instinct MI450 chips starting in Q3 of 2026. A consortium of Big Tech investors—including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI—plans to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. And OpenAI entered what’s likely a multimillion-dollar deal to roll out a custom AI chip with Broadcom. While some of the tech giants have enormous revenues, they’re still taking on debt to bolster their offerings and build infrastructure, like data centers. OpenAI, for instance, is not expected to break even for years to come. The enormous amounts of cash involved and huge investments around AI have inspired comparisons to the dot-com stock market bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan writes about the similarities between both periods of tech growth and enthusiasm, and predicts what fallout might look like for the economy. The bigger question, Cohan writes, is whether the economy is ready for it. Another question worth asking is whether this approach to AI will actually help the U.S. stay ahead in the race to dominate the technology. Forbes contributor Vivian Toh writes that while the U.S. is forming several capital—and debt—heavy alliances for AI, Chinese firms are focusing on open-source and easily adaptable technology. Toh writes that the AI race looks less like a sprint for maximizing intelligence and is now more about infrastructure. The biggest question is who can balance scaling the technology and maintain its resilience, she writes. AI is everywhere, and Oracle is unveiling its new starring role in its ERP and operational work at its AI World event this week—known as CloudWorld until this year. Forbes contributor Robert Kramer writes that Oracle is bringing AI agents into many of its enterprise cloud software suites. A payables agent automates invoicing in Oracle’s Fusion Cloud ERP and EPM. A ledger agent provides accountants with continuous insight. A planning agent supports event-driven forecasting. For supply chain, agents now automate several planning, fulfillment and compliance processes that could take hours to resolve manually. Oracle’s new agents, Kramer writes, are focused on intelligent and accountable AI. At the event, they’re demonstrating how to trace and review agent decisions for compliance, which can especially help companies in highly regulated industries. Kramer writes this stance on AI agents is intended to meet companies where they are, integrating new capabilities into the functions they’re already using. Much has been said about how AI-powered coding can transform the programming industry. But is AI-generated code any good? Forbes senior contributor Adrian Bridgwater took a deep dive into this question, asking Yrieix Garnier, vice president of product at Datadog for his observations. So far, many of the problems between expectations and output come from prompting. Better code, Bridgwater writes, comes from more structured and detailed instructions of what it needs to do and how. The only context that should be included is that which is immediately relevant—extra context may lead to coding errors. But with access to the right data and in the optimal setup, an AI coding app can be a valuable collaborator, he writes. Data privacy is becoming an increasingly more important topic, especially as different countries and states roll out different privacy laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of AI-powered data privacy company Clarip, about how companies can ensure that they are in compliance wherever they operate. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. When privacy laws in Europe went into effect, there were different instances of some social media platforms that complied with those jurisdictions’ more stringent privacy requirements. Are the platforms still working on multiple versions, or are they figuring out how to make one system that follows privacy laws? Sambandam: We are a data privacy platform. We’re right in the middle of this thing, and we have a lot of customers that have presence in the EU, in Germany and Spain and in Italy and France and U.K. Companies still, even to this day, take an approach where they [decide], ‘Hey, if a visitor’s coming in from the EU or to our site in the EU, then we’re not going to track this data. Or if it’s coming from America and a certain state, we’re going to not do anything. We’re going to collect all the data and share it freely.’ This has actually given a raise to a pretty interesting subset of services. There are companies using IP address to understand where you’re coming from, which city or country you belong to. You can make a call to understand where that user is coming from: Is [a person] coming from Germany or is she coming from Virginia? Those types of calls are happening seamlessly behind the scenes. These providers are growing tremendously because companies started using some of these tools behind the scenes. The tools, whether it’s ours or other tools, have technology to tweak or configure their platform so that they can decide where somebody is coming from and then track or not track, or use third-party cookies or not use third-party cookies. Tech companies are made up of people who create the tech part, but then there are different departments, like legal and marketing. Do they understand exactly what the ramifications are between privacy laws and what they mean to all countries? The simple and honest answer to your question is not at all. They don’t understand. I see this personally in many of the large Fortune 100 companies that I engage with. The person in the IT world, for example, they’re not really thinking about privacy. If you’re a CIO, you are a business person saying, ‘Hey, I need this feature to be built.’ The developer, the engineer, they’re just going and writing a piece of code. Especially in the last 10, 15 years, software development has almost become like Lego building blocks. If you want to build something, you go download some existing library and then build things on top of it. By nature, software is collecting and sharing data downstream. The IT person or the engineers, they’re not really thinking privacy that much, but the legal and compliance people are. At the same time, I’ve seen marketing and sales team members, for them, data collection and analytics is super important so that they can do retargeting. You’ve probably seen this: You’re looking for something or talking to your friend about a certain thing, and all of a sudden you start seeing ads for that red sweater or shoes or ticket to the Caribbean. It’s a complex issue. The marketing team [can go to] extra lengths to find ways to circumvent these privacy laws. But then the privacy teams are like, ‘Hey, no, you’re not supposed to do this because we have these laws.’ I’ve seen companies where if the chief compliance officer or legal officer [comes from] a much larger state, those companies’ privacy programs will be more strict and stringent. Where the marketing rules, you’re going to see they have the upper hand. What do you suggest that a company working in this space do to make sure that they are complying with all applicable laws everywhere without being too careful? Try to do what’s in the best interest of your customers. If you have consent from your customers to share data, then do that. But you have to be upfront about it. How often do you actually read terms and conditions or a privacy notice top to bottom? Never, right? It’s simplifying that and telling people what data are you collecting, who are you going to share with and how are you going to use it. If you can show that true value proposition, people are willing to share. If you want to receive coupons for Black Friday, $25 off or 25% off, but you’ve got to give an email address or sign up for a newsletter, then you’re going to do it. You’ve got to avoid dark patterns. Don’t try to sneak something in the middle of your privacy policy that’s 4,000 words long. Sometimes, the company is challenged on what they say in the project policy is one thing. What’s actually happening behind the scenes is something else. Legal people don’t understand technology evolving, and they may have returned a project policy 12 months ago that’s no longer valid. Now, something’s changed in that technology ecosystem. Doing annual checks or quarterly audits, and being transparent, getting consent are some big common sense things you can do that could get you out of trouble and that would help you in the balances. While AI can work harder than a person, it can also fail harder. Here are some tips to maximize the assistance you get from the technology and prevent the deepest pitfalls. In order to lead to growth, AI innovation needs safeguards and governance, but it also needs to be able to compete—something proven by the recipients of this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics.

Title: Kieran Quilligan suffered multiple fractures, court hears
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1016/1538977-quilligan-trial/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:14:38Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The trial of two men for the murder of Kieran Quilligan - who had been missing for five months - has been told that there were multiple fractures to his bones, consistent with blows from a blunt weapon, similar to a hammer. However, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she could not say what the cause of death was, or when Mr Quilligan died, due to the level of body decompositon which meant there were no organs to examine or toxicology reports available. Kieran Quilligan, who was 47, was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His body was found in a jute bag in a ravine at Whitewell, adjacent to the Midleton to Whitegate road, on 28 January 2024. Luke Taylor, 27, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon in Cork, both deny murdering Mr Quilligan. In her evidence at the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, Dr Bolster said that before she carried out a post-mortem examination, she examined the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine, 8-10m from the roadway, where there was a jute bag covered in mud and vegetation. Underneath this was another jute bag, she said, "partially open, with a pelvic bone protruding". Dr Bolster also said that she could see ribs and "a huge skull with a bag around it, tied with a knot". She told the jury of two women and ten men that the post-mortem the following day revealed multiple fractures to the bones, both old and recent. Recent traumas, she said, included displaced fractures to both head and neck, fractures to the left ankle, fractures to the cheekbones, a depressed fracture to the left of the skull extending to the top of the head, and across the palate. There were fractures to the upper and lower jaw bones, with only one tooth remaining either at death or post-mortem. There were also multiple fractures to the chest and ribs, a displaced fracture to the right scapula with a small piece of bone missing, a fracture of the right upper limb, as well as a lower limb fracture of the right thigh bone, suggesting a blow with a blunt instrument, like a hammer, Dr Bolster said. Mr Quilligan had received multiple blows of a blunt weapon, like a hammer, she added. But as no internal organs were left, or toxicology available, she could not say what the cause of death was, or determine a precise cause. Under cross-examination by Ray Boland, Senior Counsel for Niall Long, Dr Bolster said that Mr Quilligan's drug use would have increased his vulnerability to death by assault. Asked by Senior Counsel Brendan Grehan, for Luke Taylor, about the plastic bags with knots around the victim's neck, Dr Bolster said that it looked like they were used to move the body. "There's no evidence that there were bags over the head of the deceased. They were possibly used as a ligature, possibly used to carry the body," she said. The pathologist also indicated that there was no evidence of a shooting or stab wounds. Another witness, Sergeant Maurice O'Connor, of Anglesea Street Garda Station, gave evidence of examining mobile phones seized during a search of a house in Mahon two weeks after Mr Quilligan was reported missing. In particular, he referred to Whatsapp messages between Janice Long, and her son, Niall Long. In a message, sent on 2 September, she asked: "Ok, my jeep stinks of Dettol?" and the reply from his mobile number was: "Yeah, it does. The fella who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and was thrown in the boot", Sgt O'Connor told the court. The trial before Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford has adjourned for the day and will continue tomorrow. © RTÉ 2025.

The Wall Street giant said Thursday it will retool one of its money market funds to cater explicitly to U.S. stablecoin issuers, by making the fund an approved reserve asset for such tokens under the recently passed GENIUS Act. The BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL) will remove agency investments, shorten the maturity of its investments in U.S. Treasuries, and add overnight repurchase agreements as an eligible asset, in a bid to make the fund both compliant with GENIUS and maximally liquid for stablecoin issuers. Jon Steel, global head of product for BlackRock’s cash management business, said Thursday that the company has seen increased demand from stablecoin issuers seeking reserve management options in the wake of GENIUS’s passage. “We believe [the fund] positions BlackRock as one of the reserve asset managers of choice for the digital payments ecosystem,” Steel said in a statement. BlackRock’s bold push into stablecoin reserves is all but certain to have a significant impact on the sector. Earlier this week, the company reported that its cash management business has surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time ever. Its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are also handily the largest trading on Wall Street. Today’s development is far from the firm’s first stablecoin foray, though. In 2022, BlackRock led a $400 million funding round for USDC issuer Circle, in a deal that made the asset manager a primary holder of Circle’s reserves. Crypto has been top of mind for BlackRock this week. On Tuesday, the company’s CEO, Larry Fink, announced the firm is currently developing its own technology to tokenize all manner of traditional assets. “It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said at the time. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: How The SEC’s Ethereum Nod Could Unlock A Trillion-Dollar Market

Time Published: 2025-10-16T16:02:28Z

ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. “I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets — from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board,” said Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, in an interview with CNBC. Coming from the world’s largest asset manager, it’s a strong signal. In parallel, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took a quieter but equally telling step: a nod to Ethereum’s ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into digital tokens. In plain terms, it means law can now travel with the asset — every share, bond, or fund can carry its own rules, embedded directly in its software code — the smart contract. That shift is dramatically accelerating a trillion-dollar tokenized asset market, where law and regulatory compliance move with the asset and live on the blockchain. When SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins explicitly refers to a blockchain token standard, it’s a sign that finance itself is changing. In a recent speech, Atkins described how compliance requirements could be written directly into smart contracts — citing ERC-3643, the Ethereum-based standard that embeds regulatory safeguards into tokenized securities. It was a subtle but historic moment. A top U.S. regulator recognizing code itself as a tool to ensure regulatory compliance on-chain. The idea behind ERC-3643 is simple but radical — make regulation part of the token itself. Each token carries its own rulebook: who can hold it, where it can trade, and when it can be redeemed. Every transfer automatically checks both sides for legal eligibility. If conditions aren’t met, the transaction never happens. When I met Luc Falempin, co-author of the protocol and co-founder of the startup Tokeny, he recalled the problem that started it all. “Financial institutions loved blockchain but couldn’t use it,” he said. “The tools were outdated, and compliance was manual. We made the rules part of the asset.” That insight led to T-REX, meaning ‘token for regulated exchanges,’ developed for real-world projects tokenizing equities and real estate with regulators involved from the start. Formalized in a 2018 white paper, it became ERC-3643 in 2021, the Ethereum standard for permissioned tokens that can move peer-to-peer yet remain fully compliant. Ethereum’s open standards power everything from stablecoins to NFTs. ERC-3643 adds a missing layer — a framework for regulated assets that embeds compliance directly into code. It lets law move with the asset. Built on Ethereum’s familiar architecture, ERC-3643 adds identity checks and transfer rules where required by law. Instead of building closed systems, institutions can plug into the same open infrastructure that powers DeFi. “Stablecoins and NFTs changed what could exist on-chain,” said Falempin. “ERC-3643 changes who can hold it and how. It connects innovation to regulation.” While most institutions were experimenting with private blockchains or proprietary solutions, Falempin’s team built openly on Ethereum. “The public EVM ecosystem gave us the libraries, the community, and the speed we needed,” he said. That choice saved years of development and ensured ERC-3643 works across networks. By encoding compliance in open standards, rather than proprietary systems, Tokeny showed that open source can lead to business wins in finance just like it does in the field of technology. In his July 2025 address, Atkins outlined how tokenized assets could comply through “principles-based conditions” rather than rigid, outdated rules — including “verified-pool” functionality and token standards with built-in compliance features such as ERC-3643. The head of the world’s most powerful securities agency cited an Ethereum standard as a model for how law itself can operate on-chain. When legal scholar Lawrence Lessig warned that “code is law” in his book "Code Version 2.0"," he meant that software could shape behavior as powerfully as legislation. Two decades later, that idea has flipped. Law itself now runs on code — embedded directly into digital assets so compliance executes automatically. With ERC-3643, regulation isn’t enforced later; it happens in real time. The law no longer follows the asset. Instead, law travels with it. In May 2025, Apex Group, a 13,000-employee financial-services firm with more than $3 trillion under management, acquired a majority stake in Tokeny and appointed Falempin as the new Head of Product for Apex Digital. It wasn’t an exit — it was a convergence. Apex brings regulatory infrastructure and clients; Tokeny brings the technology and the open standard. “We’re building the digital rails institutions can trust,” Falempin said. “If you lose your wallet, your assets can be recovered. If you change blockchains, your identity follows. That’s how traditional finance works — and how on-chain finance should.” Citi-backed research estimates that $5 trillion of traditional securities could be tokenized by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group puts it closer to $16 trillion. Either way, scale demands compliance. ERC-3643 offers precisely that — compliance by design. A fund issued in Luxembourg can now be held by an investor in Singapore, settled instantly on-chain, and remain compliant in both jurisdictions — because the rules are embedded in the token itself. When asked what legacy he hopes ERC-3643 will leave, Falempin paused.“Now that we have open and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure, along with a compliant token protocol, we have a massive opportunity to upgrade the financial system,” he said. “Traditional finance is slow, costly, and inaccessible because it relies on endless reconciliation. Blockchain can change that. I believe most capital markets will move on-chain within the next ten years.” The era of tokenized real-world assets is no longer hypothetical — it’s here. And at its core lies a protocol few outside the industry have heard of: ERC-3643, the Ethereum standard turning the promise of tokenized finance into a trillion-dollar reality. What began as an experiment in code is fast becoming one of the new operating systems of global finance.

Title: BlackRock targets stablecoin boom with new fund

BlackRock is expanding its crypto footprint with a new fund tailored for stablecoin issuers. The BSTBL aims to streamline reserve management under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock has launched the Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund for stablecoin issuers. The fund cements BlackRock’s position as a top reserve manager for stablecoin providers, offering liquidity and GENIUS Act compliance. BlackRock is taking a major step deeper into digital assets, launching a retooled money market fund. According to a CNBC report, the fund is designed for stablecoin issuers as global stablecoin supply surges to an all-time high. Also, the new product, the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund [BSTBL], aims to help issuers manage reserves more efficiently under the GENIUS Act. The landmark U.S. legislation was signed by President Donald Trump months ago and created the country’s first federal framework for stablecoins. BlackRock said the BSTBL fund now offers greater liquidity, expanded trading hours, and full compliance with the new stablecoin standards. The move positions it to become the go-to reserve manager for the next wave of stablecoin providers. BlackRock already oversees Circle’s $64 billion USDC reserve portfolio. It helped push its cash-management business above $1 trillion in assets last quarter. With the updated BSTBL fund, the firm plans to bring the same model to other issuers. Also, it offers secure, yield-bearing exposure to short-term U.S. Treasurys and government securities. Furthermore, the launch comes as the stablecoin supply reaches a record $302.3 billion, according to recent data. Source: X According to CryptoRank, new entrants such as USDe, USD1, and PYUSD are fueling adoption as institutional capital floods in. BlackRock’s pivot reflects how Wall Street is moving from merely investing in crypto to powering its core financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are increasingly used to settle trades, provide collateral, and transfer value across blockchains—functions that demand the kind of liquidity management BlackRock specializes in. With the GENIUS Act’s clarity and its partnership track record, BlackRock is now positioned to capture a large share of that growth. BlackRock’s latest move extends its crypto presence beyond ETFs and tokenized funds like BUIDL. As the stablecoin market breaks new records, BlackRock is no longer just offering exposure to crypto; it’s becoming part of the system’s foundation.

Title: Citizens Sees SharpLink as a Breakout Ether Treasury Play With More Than 200% Upside

Citizens has initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) with a market outperform rating and a $50 price target, implying potential upside of more than 200%, the bank said in a Wednesday report. The shares were 2% higher in early trading, around $15.45. The bank’s bullish stance rests on a positive long-term view of ether’s price trajectory, forecasting ETH above $7,000 by 2026 and potentially exceeding $20,000 by 2030. The report argued that SharpLink has quickly emerged as one of the most ambitious ether ETH$3,904.64 treasury operators in the public markets. After accumulating a substantial ETH position, the company has begun deploying those assets into staking and other yield-bearing strategies designed to compound value over time. The stock is a novel entry point for investors seeking leveraged exposure to Ethereum’s growth, analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote. Rather than functioning as a passive vehicle holding bitcoin BTC$106,789.93 or ether, SharpLink aims to actively manage its ETH balance sheet, issuing equity at a premium to net asset value or buying it back when trading below NAV, and using its ETH reserves to capture on-chain yield opportunities, the analysts wrote. Citizens describes this approach as a "flywheel" that can drive NAV per share higher as the Ethereum ecosystem expands and institutional adoption accelerates. The bank's analysts also assigned a premium valuation to SharpLink based on the company’s leadership and strategy. This includes Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, as Chairman and Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, as Co-CEO, describing the team as ideally positioned to scale a treasury model that blends crypto-native expertise with institutional capital market experience. SharpLink’s strategy positions it to become a market leader as ether matures into a global financial asset, according to Citizens. By combining operational leverage on-chain with financial discipline off-chain, the shares could offer a compelling alternative to traditional digital asset investment vehicles, and one that investors may reward with a valuation premium. SharpLink raised $76.5 million in a direct stock offering priced above market, the company said on Thursday.

Exponent, established in London in 2004 but now with offices in Dublin, has invested in over 40 businesses across Europe, with enterprise values ranging from €150m to €500m. Its most notable purchase was of Chanelle Pharma, Ireland’s largest indigenous manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals, last year. In 2016 it paid £150m to buy the Racing Post. Sexton, who retired from rugby after the World Cup in 2023, became Chief of Staff at Ardagh Glass the following January. However, last summer he stood down from the role in order to accept an offer from Andy Farrell to be a coach on the Lions tour of Australia. From August 1, he took up a full-time coaching post with the Irish Rugby Football Union. Making the announcement of his appointment as an adviser, Exponent said he would be supporting its portfolio-company leaders on their “individual and team performance”, and will work at an individual and team level to mentor staff on their development.

By then Exponent had made 12 investments in Irish-owned or Irish-based businesses, to a value of €1bn, including in H&MV Engineering, based in Castletroy, Limerick. In 2024, the fund bought Northern Ireland's biggest private hospital group, Kingsbridge, based in south Belfast. It was Exponent's first investment into Northern Ireland and, at with a value of £300m, represented one of the biggest private equity deals there in recent years.

Last July the private-equity firm closed its fifth fund, raising just over €1bn, to invest in “high-quality mid-market businesses". Investors included AIB and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). Exponent said its investment strategy was to support corporate, family and founder-owned businesses, which are already established leaders in their markets. In his statement Sexton said Exponent’s focus on people and on doing things in a different, more sustainable way had stood out for him. “Over my sports career, my principal focus both as a player and a coach has always been on how I could get the best out of my myself and my team mates to improve team performance.

Title: Larry Fink on Tokenization: The Future of All Assets Begins

BlackRock experienced growth across various sectors, from cash to systematic equity, AI-based equity, digital assets, and private markets. Their ETFs also had a record quarter, showcasing the company’s ability to thrive in multiple areas. This diverse growth is attributed to their comprehensive portfolio strategy, combining passive and active management, public and private investments, and advanced investment technology. Larry Fink believes we’re at the start of tokenizing all assets, including real estate, equities, and bonds. This shift could revolutionize how assets are managed and traded, providing new opportunities for investors. Tokenization could make traditional financial products more accessible, especially for those new to investing, by integrating them into the digital ecosystem. With $4.1 trillion in digital wallets globally, tokenizing ETFs could attract new investors. By digitizing ETFs, BlackRock aims to bridge the gap between crypto enthusiasts and traditional long-term retirement products. This strategy represents a significant opportunity for growth as more people engage with digital financial ecosystems. “”We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets.”” Larry Fink, once skeptical of cryptocurrency, now sees its potential. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Ebit has surpassed $100 billion, highlighting the growing acceptance and integration of digital currencies. Fink’s change of heart reflects the evolving landscape of finance and the importance of adapting to new investment opportunities. Investing consistently through market cycles can yield significant returns. Despite crises like the dot-com bubble, financial crisis, and COVID-19, long-term investors have seen an 8% compounded return over 25 years. The key is staying invested, regardless of market fluctuations, to benefit from long-term growth. Compounding is a powerful tool for building wealth over time. Earning just an extra half a percent annually over 30 years can increase a retirement fund by 15%. This demonstrates the importance of long-term investing and the impact of small gains over extended periods. “”Capital is at work. You like that? I love.”” Larry Fink is thrilled to see more young people investing in equities. He emphasizes the importance of transitioning from short-term trading to long-term investment strategies. By focusing on long-term ownership, young investors can build substantial wealth over their lifetimes, benefiting from market growth and compounding. Despite economic challenges, the long-term outlook for markets remains positive. Historical data shows that investing in the market over extended periods, even through downturns, can yield substantial returns. This reinforces the importance of maintaining confidence in the market’s long-term potential. Tokenization represents a new wave of opportunity in investing, allowing traditional assets like real estate and equities to be digitized. This could enable more investors, especially younger ones, to engage with traditional long-term investment products through digital platforms. Young investors can significantly benefit from a long-term investment strategy by focusing on compounding returns over time. Even a slight increase in annual returns can lead to substantial growth in their retirement savings, making it crucial to invest consistently rather than trying to time the market. BlackRock views digital assets as a key component of the future investment landscape, with the potential to attract new investors into traditional markets. By integrating digital wallets and tokenized products, they aim to create a seamless ecosystem for investors to manage their assets. View on YouTube

Title: Echobit Launches RWA Ecosystem Month: Global Call for High-Quality Projects with Funding and Compliance Support

October 16, 2025 09:39 ET | Source: Echobit Echobit SINGAPORE, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization has rapidly become one of the most promising sectors in the crypto market. By mapping real-world assets, such as bonds, real estate, and commodities onto the blockchain, RWA enables traditional financial instruments to circulate and trade on-chain — injecting real value and stability into decentralized finance (DeFi). As the sector gains momentum, an increasing number of high-quality projects are emerging, fueling the next wave of market growth. Echobit RWA Ecosystem Month Launches To promote the sustainable growth of the RWA ecosystem, Echobit, a global cryptocurrency exchange, is officially launching RWA Ecosystem Month — a global initiative to recruit promising RWA projects. The program will be led by Echobit Labs, the platform’s investment and incubation arm, providing selected projects with funding, technical guidance, and compliance support. By leveraging Echobit’s global regulatory framework and ecosystem resources, the initiative aims to help RWA teams accelerate product development and market adoption. Apply here: Submit the form. This recruitment focuses on RWA-related projects, with evaluation criteria emphasizing technological innovation, regulatory potential, and business sustainability. Echobit Labs will leverage Echobit’s global regulatory licenses — including MSB and VASP registrations — as well as its media and ecosystem partnerships, to provide projects with cross-regional compliance support and strategic guidance. In 2025, RWA stands out as one of the most transformative narratives in Web3. With global financial institutions such as BlackRock and JPMorgan entering the field, RWA is increasingly recognized as the bridge connecting traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, rapid growth has also revealed challenges — from legal compliance and custody security to off-chain asset synchronization and market education. Regulatory discrepancies across jurisdictions, the legal enforceability of smart contracts, and the technical feasibility of on-chain asset management all remain critical hurdles for long-term RWA development. Through RWA Ecosystem Month, Echobit aims to lower entry barriers and reduce compliance burdens for innovative RWA projects, offering direct financial and ecosystem support. More than a short-term initiative, Echobit’s RWA Ecosystem Month marks the beginning of a long-term strategy to foster Web3’s real-world integration. Moving forward, Echobit will continue to launch themed incubation programs and dedicated investment plans — working with top-tier projects worldwide to accelerate the on-chain transformation of real-world assets and build a transparent, efficient, and trusted digital asset ecosystem. About Echobit Echobit is a global cryptocurrency exchange specializing in perpetual futures and copy trading. With security and compliance at its core, the platform offers a safe, efficient, and transparent trading experience under a global regulatory framework — including MSB licenses in the U.S. and Canada, VASP registration in the Czech Republic, and membership in Korea’s CODE Alliance.

Title: XRP’s Most Important Week In History: Here’s What’s Coming For Ripple
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-most-important-week/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T13:30:44Z
Full Content:
With the second half of the month of October underway, the crypto market has now turned its attention toward Ripple and its native XRP token. A number of important events await Ripple and XRP, starting from next week. These developments could be incredibly bullish for the altcoin’s price, triggering a run that many have expected for a while now. A crypto pundit who goes by Xfinancebull on the X (formerly Twitter) platform outlined the major events that are on the horizon for Ripple and XRP. The first and arguably the most famous and most anticipated of these is the XRP ETF decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With a total of 10 XRP ETF applications pending, according to data from The Block, the SEC is nearing its deadline to make a decision on the funds’ applications. Between October 18 and October 25, multiple ETF applications reach their final deadlines, and the SEC will either have to reject or green-light funds such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, among others. This comes as the SEC reduced its application review time to 75 days, bringing the deadlines closer. The next major event is the Ripple Swell event that takes place every year. This event brings together major stakeholders from all around the world to discuss the future of crypto. This year, the highlight is on BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, talking about crypto custody at the event. This has already added fuel to the rumors that BlackRock is interested in XRP and could be filing its own ETF soon. As a result, the Ripple Swell event, taking place between November 4 and 5 in New York City, is expected to be a closely watched event. In addition to the upcoming bullish developments, Ripple and XRP have already seen some events that have added to their bullishness. One of these is the completion of the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle that began in 2020. With the lawsuit out of the way, it has now paved the way for XRP ETFs and price discovery. The crypto pundit also points to global elections being more pro-crypto than before, spanning from Japan to the EU. There is also the expectation of the Clarity Act, which gives more clarification around digital assets. As all of these come together, the pundit believes that the XRP price is getting primed. First stop is expected to be $5, marking a floor, but if BlackRock comes to the table, then the analyst expects the price to rise above $6. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Share this article BlackRock is reconfiguring its money market fund to cater specifically to stablecoin issuers, aligning with the new US stablecoin regulations under the GENIUS Act, CNBC reported Thursday. The restructured BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund now focuses on investments in short-term US Treasury securities and overnight repurchase agreements, providing a secure and liquid option for managing stablecoin reserves. The GENIUS Act requires stablecoin issuers to maintain full reserve backing with assets like US Treasuries. BlackRock’s new fund will provide streamlined custody solutions that allow issuers to meet these legal standards without operational disruptions. The changes are designed to meet the growing demand for regulated, yield-bearing reserve options as stablecoin issuance is projected to significantly increase.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/16 update below. This post was originally published on October 15 Bitcoin has stabilized after a rocky few days, with a bullish intervention by Tesla billionaire Elon Musk taking the market by surprise. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price is trading around $112,000 per bitcoin after looking at risk of plummeting under $110,000 yesterday—even as a serious bitcoin price warning light flashes red. Now, after the bitcoin price “flash crash” triggered a stark BlackRock warning, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed is fast approaching a point when it can end its quantitative tightening balance sheet reduction program. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his speech at the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia, it was reported by CNBC, while also opening the door to further interest rate cuts. “We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision." 10/16 update: The bitcoin price suffered another smaller flash crash this morning, plunging to around $108,500 before bouncing back to over $111,000 in a move that highlights just how tightly wound the market is. The dip came as Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran warned U.S.-China trade tensions are adding to economic uncertainty and increasing downside risks to growth. “If monetary policy stays as restrictive as it is, and you have a shock like this hit the economy, it does materially increase the negative consequences of that shock,” Miran told Fox Business, adding he wanted to see a larger-than-expected 50 basis point interest cut from the Fed this month though expects it will match September’s 25 basis point cut. “I think that we are probably set up for three 25-basis-point cuts this year,” Miran said, warning that the economy is hinged on escalating risks around U.S.-China trade. Last week, U.S. president Donald Trump’s sudden escalation of his simmering trade war with China sparked a huge crypto sell-off, wiping out around $19 billion worth of bets on the bitcoin price. "We will have to see how the next few weeks play out," Miran added. China has accused the U.S. of stoking panic over its rare earth controls, with an official saying Treasury secretary Scott Bessent had made "grossly distorted" remarks about a top Chinese trade negotiator and rejecting a White House call to roll back the curbs, Reuters reported. The Fed’s quantitative tightening program, which began in 2022, has reduced the Fed’s balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, from around $9 trillion at its peak, putting pressure on risk assets such as bitcoin as the Fed tries to suck liquidity from the system. "Powell concentrated on quantitative tightening, whereby the Fed reduces its balance sheet. The balance sheet grew to unprecedented levels during the Great Financial Crisis, with more added amidst the Covid panic," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. "The Fed has been gently reducing its balance sheet, thereby tightening monetary policy. Powell suggested that this reduction programme may soon be wound down.” The winding down of the quantitative tightening program comes as the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates again at its Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting later this month and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have rocketed to record levels as Wall Street financial institutions pile in. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “This institutional firepower, combined with the Federal Reserve’s dovish stance following September’s rate cut and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties including the U.S. government shutdown, reinforced bitcoin’s emerging role as a digital hedge alongside gold, which itself broke through the $4,000 per ounce barrier [last] week,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank, said via email, with lower interest rates generally seen as supportive of risk assets such as high growth technology stocks and bitcoin. “As we progress through 'Uptober,’ it will be interesting to see if we make any meaningful move higher. Fed policy developments at the October 28-29 FOMC meeting may be a catalyst for a move that can either extend the rally, or trigger healthy consolidation.” The Fed had kept interest rates on hold through 2025 due to fears inflation could return until cutting rates last month, with Powell now seen flipping to concerns over the jobs market. “Powell … expressed concern over the recent deterioration in the U.S. labour market,” Morrison said. “This is now the focus for the Fed, taking over from inflation which continues to be well above the U.S. central bank’s 2% target rate. The markets continue to factor in the likelihood of two 25 basis point rate cuts before the year-end."

Title: Volatility Shares Dares SEC to Approve 5x Leveraged ETFs

As others have sought 3x leveraged ETFs, VolatilityShares is going further, raising the question of what the SEC’s leverage limit could be. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com All the double-leveraged ETFs on the market are starting to look downright quaint. Several exchange-traded fund issuers recently flooded the SEC’s Edgar system with dozens of proposed triple-leveraged single stock products. Not to be outdone, one company, Volatility Shares, skipped right to 5x. That firm filed numerous proposed ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, all of which are either 3x- or 5x-leveraged single-stock or crypto funds. That’s really taking the name Volatility Shares seriously. If there is a use case for such an aggressively risky product, it is speculative intraday betting, said Bryan Armour, director of ETF and passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar Research Services. “Anything beyond that would almost certainly be a poor outcome for investors,” he said. “Leveraged ETFs have a very bloodied history.” Volatility Shares, which declined to comment, filed for more than two dozen new ETFs. Those include both 3x and 5x single stock versions for Circle Internet Group, MicroStrategy, Nvidia, Amazon, Coinbase Global, Palantir Technologies, Tesla, Google and AMD. There are also 3x and 5x ETFs focused on digital assets, including XRP, Bitcoin, Ether and Solana. Another is a 3x leveraged VIX ETF. With positive stock performance, there is a big potential for amplified returns. What could go wrong? A lot, it would seem: ‘I’m Finished!’ It’s unclear if the SEC could approve any of the 3x leveraged ETFs that issuers are now seeking, let alone any 5x ones. The regulator has limits on volatility that historically have prevented such strategies. But then again, it was not long ago that the SEC didn’t allow single-stock or spot-crypto ETFs, Armour said. “I don’t know where the line is for the SEC anymore.” Of course, it could give some day traders what they want. “A 20% daily decline could lead to 100% losses and if held longer-term, there could be significant compounded losses even with lower daily declines,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. “If approved, however, it’s a way to capture demand and volume in a segment of the market eager for high risk/high return investing.” Pretty much all of Wall Street reported another quarter of stellar earnings this week. AI notetakers have been all the rage. Experts think compliance may be up next. Shah will remain with the company until the end of the year in an advisory capacity. Company CEO Yoav Zurel criticised the firm for blocking customers from accessing their 401(k)s. The acquisition is the latest, and largest,example of mega-firms making moves to buy out competitors in a rapidly consolidating industry. The complete blockchain overhaul of financial markets could happen in the next two decades, according to experts. Financial advisors can learn from strategies employed by the wealthiest investors to protect their assets. The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. Independent broker-dealers were the fastest-growing wealth management channel year-over-year and now account for one in five advisors. The consumer segment has eluded Goldman for years. Could this time be different? Advisors and clients haven’t been chasing returns, though, instead smartly choosing to stay diversified. Competing financial priorities and rising costs of living threaten to replace retirement as an economic reality for upcoming generations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Trump’s Bailout Can’t Mask the Cracks in the Argentina “Miracle”
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/200805/trump-milei-bailout-argentina-economy
Time Published: 2025-10-16T10:00:00Z

The Movistar arena in the Villa Crespo neighborhood of Buenos Aires seats approximately 15,000 people, and on October 6, virtually all of them were clapping, chanting, or otherwise grooving to a steady soundtrack of American rock classics: “Highway to Hell” by AC/DC, “Paint it Black” by the Rolling Stones, and “Bad to the Bone” by George Thorogood and the Destroyers, to name a few. At one point, the crowd spontaneously broke into the wave; at another, they held their phones aloft as though they were Zippos or Bic lighters. But these people were not here to catch the last gasps of Guns N’ Roses or the ageless funk-metal act Living Colour, both of which will be performing in the capital in the coming months. Instead, they had come for the launch of former television personality and current Argentine President Javier Milei’s newest book, La Construcción del Milagro (The Construction of the Miracle). Shortly before 9 p.m., more than half an hour after Milei was scheduled to take the stage, the lights went out, and an excited hum fell over the arena. A series of videos were projected on the more than 2,000 square foot screen above the main stage. The first displayed a man in profile blowing a giant shofar. This eventually gave way to scenes of violent destruction: buildings collapsing in controlled demolitions, wildfires, and even nuclear explosions. Finally, the drums of the Argentine rock band La Renga kicked in, and Milei began wending his way to the stage through a mob of adoring supporters, his mere presence igniting chants of “Li-ber-tad!” By the time he clambered onstage, he seemed out of breath, but that didn’t stop him from belting out the chorus to the song “Panic Show.” Por favor no huyan de miYo soy un rey de un mundo perdidoSoy el rey y te destrozaréTodos los cómplices son de mi apetito. There’s no use runningI am the king of a lost worldI am the king, and I will destroy youI have an appetite for accomplices. With his trademark black leather jacket, thick sideburns, and pallid complexion, he had the affect of a slightly manic vampire. Nearly two years after vowing to demolish the Argentine political caste and take a chain saw to the country’s bureaucracy, both Milei and his administration find themselves at a crossroads. In September, the Argentine Central Bank was forced to sell $1.1 billion in reserves over 72 hours to backstop the country’s plummeting currency and keep its value beneath 1,475.32 pesos to the dollar—then the outer limit of a floating exchange rate established as part of an April arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. While certain economic indicators have since improved, faith in Milei’s radical libertarian experiment has begun to falter. October polling from Zuban Córdoba & Associates found that more than 64 percent of the population now disapproves of the government thanks to an increased cost of living alongside steep social spending cuts. A string of corruption scandals involving cryptocurrencies, illicit payments, and alleged narcos hasn’t helped much, either. All of these attendant shocks have already begun to drag down the president’s electoral coalition, La Libertad Avanza, or LLA, which recently suffered a double-digit loss to its Peronist opposition in Buenos Aires’s bellwether provincial elections. With midterms scheduled for October 26, the U.S. Treasury Department has put its talon on the scales by promising a historic bailout if Milei stays the course. Yet several weeks after announcing its negotiations with Argentine officials, the Trump administration’s true motivations remain opaque even as the instability of the country’s economy—and its self-described anarcho-capitalist leader—have never been clearer. Here in his second term, Donald Trump appears to be pursuing a foreign policy rooted in the original Monroe Doctrine, in which Latin America falls under the sphere of influence of the United States. After a failed attempt to overthrow Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro during Trump’s first term, the U.S. military, under the direction of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has launched extrajudicial airstrikes on several boats off Venezuela’s coastline that the administration claims, spectacularly, are transporting fentanyl and other drugs. These strikes have killed more than 20 and destroyed at least one Colombian vessel, according to the nation’s president, Gustavo Petro. On Wednesday, Trump ratcheted up his pressure campaign, acknowledging that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert action inside Venezuela’s borders. For Juan Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires, these acts and the administration’s eagerness to support the Milei government fit a larger pattern. “You have two governments in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago that are part of a diplomatic encirclement of Venezuela,” Tokatlian told The New Republic. “The United States already has control of [Nayib] Bukele in El Salvador, [Daniel] Noboa in Ecuador, and Santiago Peña in Paraguay. The governments of Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, and the Dominican Republic are all ready to cooperate with the United States. The center left is underwater in Chile and Colombia, and then you have the most important election in Brazil next October. “If all four South American governments were to swing right,” says Tokatlian, “then the United States would find the entire hemisphere in its power again. That’s why it’s so important for Trump that Milei and his economic model succeed.” What exactly this means in practical terms has yet to be defined, but Argentina offers a few clues. On September 30, less than a week after agreeing to Trump’s bailout, the Argentine president signed an executive order allowing 30 officers from the elite U.S. maritime unit the Naval Special Warfare Command to carry out exercises alongside Argentine forces at three separate bases in Mar del Plata, Puerto Belgrano, and Ushuaia, the closest city to the Antarctic continent. Tokatlian contends this is part of a broader effort to decouple Argentina from China, which operates a space station in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, and has an agreement to build a Hualong One nuclear reactor in Buenos Aires. Still, he and others remain skeptical that Trump will succeed on that front, in part because Beijing remains Argentina’s second-largest trade partner behind only Brazil. “I struggle to see the geopolitical strategy here,” said Michael Paarlberg, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Latin America adviser to Bernie Sanders during the 2020 Democratic primary. “Argentina is not a top trade partner of the United States, doesn’t send a lot of migrants its way, and isn’t a pass-through country, obviously. And if the Trump administration were really concerned about China, it wouldn’t be pissing off Brazil, which is the region’s largest economy.” (Trump has revoked the visas of six Brazilian judicial officials and imposed sanctions against the wife of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, following the conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup. He has also placed a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian goods, although talks with his presidential counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are ongoing.) “This is Trump picking favorites with individual leaders who share his ideology and kiss his ass, frankly. But maybe kissing Trump’s ass is the smart move for Milei. When your country is one of the largest sovereign debtors in the world, you have limited cards to play.” Irma Gamarra waited patiently outside the Movistar Arena two hours before the book event and vanity rock concert. A gaunt woman of 42, with raven hair and a matching black bubble coat, she made the 90-minute flight from Corrientes with her husband to support the right wing populist. Previously, she claimed, she had voted for “Kirchnerismo,” a progressive political coalition spearheaded by President Néstor Kirchner and later his wife and successor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently serving six years under house arrest for graft. After years of “political devastation,” however, Gamarra acknowledged she was drawn to Milei’s “futuristic” economic model. “We need to move away from social assistance,” she said. “This country has made a mess of public spending.” For more than a year now, dozens, if not hundreds, of retirees have faced down an increasingly violent police force in front of Congress each Wednesday to protest skyrocketing medical costs and pensions that have fallen below the breadline across multiple administrations. In August, Milei vetoed a congressional vote that would have raised the minimum monthly payment of 384,305 pesos, which includes a 70,000-peso bonus, by 7.2 percent. That’s between $270 and $290, depending on the exchange rate. “In my generation, there are a lot of retirees who have never contributed anything in their lives,” Gamarra continued. “They have a lot to think about.” As for the corruption charges that have followed the Milei administration, she argued they were the work of his political enemies and that his inner circle had failed to “protect him.” “I have no doubts about my president,” she added. “That’s why I support him. That’s why I believe. That’s why we need to eliminate the deficit.” On February 14, at approximately 7 p.m. Buenos Aires time, Milei issued a curious post on the social media platform X promoting a digital coin called $LIBRA. Claiming the coin was linked to a “private project,” the president promised that its purchase would “stimulate the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small businesses and local startups.” Within the hour, the token’s value shot up to $5.54 as its market capitalization reached $4.5 billion. Then came the rug pull. In a matter of minutes, $LIBRA fell to $1.44 as initial investors cashed out, eventually costing traders more than $250 million. Alternately dubbed crypto- and $LIBRA-gate, the scandal has prompted two lawsuits in New York and Argentina—the first accusing Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis of RICO violations, and the second involving the president, two of his business associates, former adviser to Argentina’s National Securities Commission Sergio Morales, and Milei’s sister, Karina, who serves as secretary general in his administration. In separate reports from La Nación and CoinDesk, an outlet that focuses on the trading of digital currencies, Davis reportedly bragged of Milei, “I control that n****. I send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does whatever I want.” Karina Milei is no stranger to this kind of malfeasance. Nicknamed by her adoring brother “el jefe,” the masculine term for “the boss,” Karina found herself at the center of a local media firestorm in late August when leaked audios of National Disability Agency head Diego Spagnuolo accused her of accepting bribes from medical and pharmaceutical companies totaling between $500,000 and $800,000 monthly in exchange for state contracts. The administration responded by firing Spagnuolo and issuing a media embargo on the recordings that it later lifted under pressure by organizations like Amnesty International and the Argentine Journalism Forum. “To the extent that such a thing exists, the first family is not normal,” offered Juan Luis Gonzalez, a journalist and the author of the Milei biography El Loco. “We’re talking about a president who claims he can communicate with his dead dog in the afterlife. Both he and his sister suffered terrible trauma at the hands of their parents, but especially Javier, who was incredibly lonely as a child. “Karina has an emotional monopoly over her brother, and this invariably leads to trouble,” he continued. “She will torpedo his friendships and even his romantic relationships. But if Javier has a messianic complex, his sister has a voracious appetite for money that leads her to dip her hand in the cookie jar time and again. This happened when Milei was a member of Congress and has continued in La Casa Rosada.” Although the latest corruption allegations against Karina are among the most high-profile, they are hardly the only ones that have been levied against LLA. Earlier this month, José Luis Espert, a national deputy representing Buenos Aires province, was forced to scuttle his reelection bid after it was revealed that he had accepted a $200,000 payment from accused drug trafficker and money launderer Federico Machado. Both Milei and Espert insist that the charges are part of a political operation against their movement, and the latter maintains that “time will show we are not all the same.” Adding insult to political injury, the National Election Board has since denied an LLA request to reprint its paper ballots for Buenos Aires, meaning that Espert’s name will remain on the ticket when voters head to the polls later this month. If the president was at all concerned that night about his country’s sinking economy, or his coalition’s slumping electoral prospects, he kept his cards close to his heaving chest. Indeed, he was downright ebullient as he tore through Argentine rock anthems like “El Rock del Gato” by Los Ratones Paranoicos and “Blues del Equipaje” by La Mississippi. Singing back up and skipping around onstage to a rhythm mostly their own were LLA Deputy Lilia Lemoine, a onetime Manga and Marvel cosplayer, and Ana Tamagno, an aspiring congresswoman and the wife of Milei’s presidential biographer, Marcelo Duclós. On the drums was another LLA deputy, Alberto “Bertie” Benegas Lynch, a libertarian who has advocated for privatizing the ocean. Long before pursuing a career in politics, Milei sang in a Rolling Stones cover band called Everest, and his sense of showmanship is undeniable. Midway through his set, he declared that the evening was “missing some fire,” which in turn triggered several onstage pyrotechnics. Amid several audible gasps from the audience, he then launched into “Dame Fuego” by Sandro, Argentina’s campy answer to Elvis Presley during the 1960s and 1970s. If you squinted—hard—you might even convince yourself you were watching an actual arena rock show, replete with a preening lead singer and his fiendish femme cohorts. Reality intruded with a rendition of “Hava Nagila.” Written in 1918 by the Jewish composer Abraham Zevi Idelsohn, the folk song is traditionally performed at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other celebrations. Milei, an ardent supporter of Israel and a would-be convert to Judaism, who has compared his struggle to that of the ancient Maccabees, opted instead to use it as a tribute to the victims of Hamas on October 7, 2023. After previously singing along to Sandro, the crowd fell mostly silent, baffled by the Hebrew lyrics their president was shouting at them over the band. Between these performances, the event’s organizers projected a pair of confounding compilation videos. The first featured an ecstatic-bordering-on-weepy Milei embracing a series of celebrities and dignitaries that included Sylvester Stallone, Elon Musk, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Donald Trump himself. The second included a montage of images and scenes from conservative Charlie Kirk’s final public appearance at Utah State University—a video that culminated in close-range footage of his gruesome assassination. As Kirk lurched back and bled out on-screen, the audience erupted in a show of support for the fallen Turning Point USA director. Milei’s final number of the evening was a cover of Charly Garcia’s “Tu Vicio,” a song about how we’re unable to quit our own vices. The Argentine head of state then announced to the LLA faithful that he needed to take a break so that he could “bathe” and “look like a president.” During the intermission, Milei’s fans made their way to the aisles. Several concession stands in the lower bowl had run out of hamburger patties earlier in the evening, so attendees dined on pink panchos con papas fritas—foot-long hotdogs topped with miniature french fries. At different gates were book stands with titles like El Libro Negro de la Nueva Izquierda (The Black Book of the New Left) by Nicolas Marquez and Agustín Laje and Como Fabricar Una Feminista … (How to Make a Feminist …) by the Brazilian reactionary Sara Winter Huff. Each featured piles upon piles of Milei’s latest, whose cover photo displayed the president pouting over a chain saw with the inscription “las fuerzas del cielo” (“the forces of heaven”)—a reference to both his followers and the mystical powers with which he claims to govern. Published by Hojas del Sur, which bills itself as the publishing house of Argentina’s culture war, the book’s flap copy boasts that readers will learn the “recipe that saved [the country] from what would have been an unprecedented political, social and economic crisis” and created “the most successful stabilization case in world history.” Since assuming office in December 2023, Milei has radically reduced monthly inflation from 11.9 percent that November to 2.1 percent last month. He has likewise succeeded in lowering poverty from 41.7 percent at the end of his Peronist predecessor Alberto Fernández’s presidency to 32 percent through the first half of this year, although the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina’s Observatory on Social Debt has suggested this decline may be “overrepresented.” Nevertheless, there are multiple reasons to believe the Argentine economy had been sinking, if not teetering on collapse, before the U.S. Treasury sprang into action. Efforts to integrate the nation’s sprawling villas (slums) into their respective cities have stalled out, while families are struggling to stay afloat amid debilitating cuts to soup kitchens, energy and transportation subsidies, and much more. Milei has also taken out a $20 billion loan from the IMF to help shore up his country’s depleted reserves, and in September, Argentina’s country risk, which measures its likelihood of debt default, briefly soared above 1,200 points. “Milei was facing the end of his government,” said Diego Guelar, the Argentine ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 1999 and 2002 to 2014. “Confidence in him had cratered, and the country was facing its first default since 2001. I’ve been Argentina’s ambassador in Washington twice, and I’ve never seen a bailout quite like this. The administration may have averted a crisis for now, but finding a long-term solution will depend on all of us.” On September 24, in a post on the social media platform X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that U.S. government was prepared to “do what is needed to support Argentina and the Argentine people,” citing the country’s “geopolitical strategic importance.” In recent weeks, the terms of Trump administration’s relief package have slowly come into focus. They include a “significant” standby credit line via America’s Emergency Stabilization Fund, a $20 billion currency swap, and the purchase of Argentina’s dollar bonds. (The Treasury has already bought up Argentine pesos on the foreign exchange market.) Bessent has likewise indicated that his department is working with private-sector investment funds to create a separate $20 billion facility that would invest in the country’s sovereign debt. “Despite the tens of billions that Washington arranged in April from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank, Argentina’s economy has remained vulnerable to currency crises,” explained Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy. “The country’s sovereign bonds are rated in junk territory, which means bondholders are making a speculative investment and can sell off at the first sign of news they perceive to be bad.” Days after Bessent’s initial post on X, stories in both countries began circulating that the billionaire founder of Discovery Capital Management, Robert Citrone, was heavily invested in Argentina, and that he had long-standing ties to Bessent dating back to their time together at Soros Fund Management. Then, on October 9, The New York Times reported that investment firms including Blackrock, Fidelity, and Pimco all stood to profit handsomely from the Trump administration’s rescue plan. Bessent has separately told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham that Argentina is “rich in rare earths and uranium,” and that he expects they’ll be “committed to U.S. private companies coming in and being good partners with them.” “What people need to understand is that this not a bailout,” said Juan Grabois, a prominent social activist and Peronist candidate for president during the 2023 election cycle. “I read the Democrats’ original letter to Trump, and it sickened me that somebody like Bernie Sanders, who I know and respect, would call it that. This is an attempt to rescue a failing, far-right government. In Milei, Trump has found a court jester who he can use as his South American spokesman. And when that spokesman ceases to be of value, he’ll throw him away like he would a used condom.” A summit at the White House this week between representatives of the two countries would seem to bear out Grabois’s suspicions. During the lunch event on Tuesday, Trump revealed that although the United States is prepared to move forward with a bailout, it would “not be generous with Argentina” if Milei were to lose. (In typical Trump fashion, it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the upcoming midterms or Argentina’s 2027 election, when the the president he endorsed personally could be a lame duck.) “If he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.” Bessent was more to the point. “We’re confident that the president’s party will, and the coalition will, do well in the [midterm] election,” he said. “Going back to failed Peronist policies would cause a U.S. rethink.” The treasury secretary has since clarified that the United States will support the Argentine government regardless of how it performs later this month so long as it continues to pursue “good policies.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he described his department’s approach as that of “an economic Monroe Doctrine.” Last week, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, introduced a bill formally blocking the package. Republicans, meanwhile, have gone largely silent since Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa protested Trump’s willingness to enable a competing soybean exporter. Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an outspoken member of the America First movement who has bucked the president on issues ranging from Israel to health care and tariffs, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.* Milei reappeared onstage sometime after 10 p.m. with an Argentine flag draped over a fresh suit and tie. After growling his way through the national anthem, he finally got down to the business of the evening: a discussion with Buenos Aires Aires city legislator and presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni about the themes of his latest book and the future of the country more broadly. By then, the crowd had noticeably thinned and the mood had grown subdued. Over the next half hour, Milei delivered a discourse that has become familiar to Argentine and American audiences alike. He railed against the evils of cancel culture and “wokeismo,” denouncing what he called the left’s penchant for political violence. He extolled the “colossus of the world” Donald Trump to a smattering of applause. He implored his voters to not let up in the next election, that “freedom must advance, or Argentina will go backward.” And through it all, the flag sat bunched in his lap like a child’s blanket. As the audience filed out past a Maybelline New York lipstick station and a Smirnoff-sponsored selfie booth, Milei concluded his event as only he could—with a promise to “make Argentina great again.” * This article originally misidentified Marjorie Taylor Greene.

The next frontier may be less glamorous.Regulatory compliance could become the next battlefield for advisors and offer significant cost savings for firms, which often pay millions of dollars to comply with federal and state regulations, as well as industry rules, each year. Much of those expenses cover risk officers and compliance teams. The new tools would only add to AI’s already significant impact on financial services; the fintech market, which is rapidly incorporating AI into its services, is estimated to grow to more than $1 trillion by 2032. Platforms that draft emails, summarize meetings and take notes have cropped up left and right, and some firms have even launched their own chatbot LLMs to answer clients’ questions. “Our industry as a whole is a little behind when it comes to AI, and that’s not a bad thing,” said Ryan Borer, managing partner of Advisor CRM. “AI meeting notetakers, meeting prep, that stuff caught on because it was so easy to adopt… There’s a lot of firms still focusing on that, but I think there are some other areas we’ll start to see more of an emphasis on.” AI isn’t just expanding into other capabilities, like creating marketing materials from scratch and picking stocks. One of the latest firms to join the fray, Hamachi.ai, has a compliance bot that ensures everything it produces is in line with regulations imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. Hamachi.ai CEO Mike Wilson has worked at the convergence of tech and wealth for decades, helping bring PC-oriented firms to the web in the early 2000s. “We see a very similar type of transformation now, as the wealth management community starts to use AI in their practices,” Wilson said. “The future, in our opinion, belongs to firms that connect expertise with AI and compliance, and that do so with the ability to deliver personalized advice at scale.” In the Hopper. One capability that may become crucial in coming years is an AI model that integrates data from numerous sources and minimizes what Borer calls “system hopping,” or using different tech platforms to perform different tasks. “We’ve got a CRM here, we’ve got our financial planning software here,” he said. “There’s certain points [where] data doesn’t flow correctly.” The solution, Borer added, is to implement either an all-in-one platform or an additional tech layer that sits on top of, and integrates, whatever platforms a firm already uses. “There’s a lot of advisors frustrated by lack of integration in tech stacks,” Borer said. “We’re starting to really connect the dots.” Pretty much all of Wall Street reported another quarter of stellar earnings this week. As others have sought 3x leveraged ETFs, VolatilityShares is going further, raising the question of what the SEC’s leverage limit could be. Shah will remain with the company until the end of the year in an advisory capacity. Company CEO Yoav Zurel criticised the firm for blocking customers from accessing their 401(k)s. The acquisition is the latest, and largest,example of mega-firms making moves to buy out competitors in a rapidly consolidating industry. The complete blockchain overhaul of financial markets could happen in the next two decades, according to experts. Financial advisors can learn from strategies employed by the wealthiest investors to protect their assets. The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. Independent broker-dealers were the fastest-growing wealth management channel year-over-year and now account for one in five advisors. The consumer segment has eluded Goldman for years. Could this time be different? Advisors and clients haven’t been chasing returns, though, instead smartly choosing to stay diversified. Competing financial priorities and rising costs of living threaten to replace retirement as an economic reality for upcoming generations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

New York's Wall Street elites are signing massive checks to support Andrew Cuomo's mayoral race, while some of the rank-and-file are donating to Zohran Mamdani in hopes that someday their much smaller paychecks can land them an apartment without roommates. Business Insider's analysis of donation data and conversations with donors on Wall Street shed light on this divide ahead of Thursday night's first general election debate. Almost 80% of higher-earning, front-office workers, like investment bankers or hedge fund managers, donated to Cuomo and affiliated groups. The Mamdani camp won out among nearly every other job function, receiving direct donations from almost 90% of back-office donors like those in operations, human resources, tech, and research. Take Jane Street, a highly secretive trading group. Sixteen of its employees donated to both candidates for a total just over $10,000. Only one — a trader — boosted Cuomo, writing a $5,000 check. The other fifteen, mostly software engineers, gave an average of just over $350 each to Mamdani. When America thinks of Wall Street, it pictures investment bankers decked out in collared shirts and Patagonia vests. Many workers in the financial industry aren't cutting big deals — they're making under $200K. They donated $25 here and $110 there because they appreciate Mamdani's focus on cost of living. Even for those making six figures in finance, rents are high. Wall Streeters showed up for Mamdani in slightly greater numbers, but with smaller checks. Across more than 400 financial companies, 397 workers donated directly to Cuomo's campaign versus 401 to Mamdani's. Cuomo's donors had deeper pockets, giving 88% of the total dollars donated, with an average donation per employee of $1,006, compared to Mamdani's $131. When factoring in PAC spending, the pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani dollar disparity is even larger: 95% of the more than $9 million the industry donated went to support Cuomo, who has his own affordability plan but has also stressed crime and subway safety during his campaign. Mamdani got less than 5% the donations that came from managers and investment professionals, compared to two thirds of donations given by all other roles. Tech workers in finance were particularly supportive of Mamdani compared to other departments, giving him 88% of their donations. The wealth gap between front and back office is relative. A hypothetical administrative assistant earning roughly $83,000 a year may be debating whether he can afford a big enough home for two kids, but he's not struggling to feed his family. But compared to an early-career investment banker earning nearly $300,000 and on a trajectory toward $1.25 million when they become a managing director, there is a large financial gulf. The assistant's salary would go far in other cities, but in New York, back-office support workers told Business Insider tha their relative positions mean they relate more to Mamdani's middle-class base than to their bosses. They told us that's not about political parties — he is the Democratic nominee, and Cuomo, a Democrat, is running as an independent — it's all about cost of living. "The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me," said one donor, a lifelong New Yorker who once worked in a non-investment role on Wall Street and canvassed for Mamdani. "Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy," said this donor, adding that she's seen coworkers and neighbors increasingly priced out and pushed to the suburbs. Mamdani has run on promises to freeze prices of rent-stabilized apartments, make city buses free, and provide free childcare for all New Yorkers. He proposes paying for this by increasing taxes on residents who make more than $1 million a year and raising the corporate tax rate statewide by 4.25% — which would require state approval. Wall Street bosses have warned that electing him would drive companies to leave the world's financial capital. Have a tip? Contact these reporters via Signal at alexnicoll.01 and julianakaplan.33.

"I'm supporting Zohran because I want a mayor who prioritizes the needs of the working and middle class," a creative worker at a Wall Street firm said. "Those have always been my priorities as well. Working on Wall Street doesn't change that at all." We looked at firms that invest, manage, or transfer financial assets and those that create the infrastructure needed to make this possible. This includes hedge funds, like Citadel, whose CEO Ken Griffin wrote a $50,000 check to an anti-Mamdani PAC, or Third Point, whose CEO Dan Loeb donated more than $350,000 to Cuomo and related PACs. Loeb tweeted after Mamdani's primary win that it's "officially hot commie summer." Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman on Wednesday gave $1 million to an anti-Mamdani PAC, following $500,000 in donations earlier this year to pro-Cuomo PACs. Ackman wrote on X in September that Mamdani has "no experience, none, in managing a business, let alone the most consequential and largest city in our country." Cuomo, "is an experienced leader that cares deeply about our city who has the relevant experience and skills necessary to lead and greatly improve NYC," he added. We also looked at investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, whose chief Jamie Dimon said that Mamdani was a "Marxist" at an event earlier this summer, before saying on Tuesday he would help Mamdani if he were elected, and payments firms like the large credit card companies. It also includes real estate investors, like Stephen Ross, chairman of Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, who gave $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC. Real estate brokers and services firms were excluded from the analysis. Looking at firms' donations themselves rather than their employees, 23 financial companies contributed more than $2 million to pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani PACs, and none to Mamdani. Paul Ryan, a 60-year-old retired investment banker and hedge fund executive who made waves as part of a small but vocal cohort of bankers who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, described the divide in colorful terms. "Older guys that have houses in Greenwich are still going to want to keep their houses in Greenwich, so they're not willing to go put their balls on the line. But younger people do; they have 40 more years of living, and are you going to live it in a Trump-dominated world?" There were some outliers among Wall Street's high rollers. For example, two wealth advisors at Merrill Lynch, the private wealth arm of Bank of America, donated a total of $7,000 to pro-Mamdani PACs, and two of the three brothers who founded budgeting app Rocket Money gave a total of $189,000 to a pro-Mamdani PAC. The donors we spoke to said they don't talk politics at work very much and are left to pick up on hints of their coworkers' affiliations. Those who support Mamdani said they assume they're in the minority. They're far from alone in the city, though: A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 3 to 7 of 1,015 likely New York City voters found that Mamdani held a 46-33% lead over Cuomo. "I think it's always been kind of a fiction that where someone works is a key factor in how they vote, or what party they support, or what political candidates they support," Morris Pearl, a former managing director of BlackRock and the chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who advocate for changes to the US tax system, said. Pearl sees folks falling into two categories: Those who may not want to pay more in taxes, and those who are "more aware that living in a city filled with people who can't afford their basic needs is not going to be good for even the rich people either." Beyond politics, Anna Tavis, clinical professor and chair of the Human Capital Management Department at NYU's School of Professional Studies, said that Mamdani represents a different expectation of leadership, "regardless of what his views are, but kind of more appealing as a person, very media savvy, connecting with the people." She added that many younger workers want their leaders to be more transparent and address the issues they care about, rather than protect the status quo. "Both sides, interestingly, I think want to get to the right place," Tavis said. "They want to be successful, they want their companies to succeed, et cetera, et cetera, but they believe in the different ways of accomplishing that."
