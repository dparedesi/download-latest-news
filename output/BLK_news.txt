Title: ‘Paying Far More Attention’: Rubio Turns His Gaze To America’s Backyard After Years Of Neglect From Washington

Time Published: 2025-05-10T14:07:12Z

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has wasted no time in reshaping a decades-long foreign policy approach that’s paid “scarce attention” to America’s backyard and opened the door to China as a result. Rubio, whose interest in Latin America was a key talking point in his nomination to his role in the State Department, made a blitz of visits and diplomatic actions to various nations in the region to secure American interests early during the administration, most recently extracting Venezuelan opposition members to the U.S. from the regime’s grasp. As the Trump administration turns its attention to issues like immigration, fentanyl trafficking and curtailing Chinese influence globally, Rubio has become one of Trump’s key liaisons in the region. “Rubio is paying far more attention to our hemisphere than previous Secretary of State’s already with just the number of visits to the region,” Andres Martinez Fernandez, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Particularly under the Biden administration, very little scarce attention to our hemisphere. I think it was really a dangerously low level of engagement.” (RELATED: ‘Playing Offense In Our Backyard’: With Biden’s Eyes Elsewhere, China Slowly Breaks US’ Grip Over Latin America) US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives at Juan Santamaria International Airport near San Jose, Costa Rica on February 4, 2025. (Photo by MARK SCHIEFELBEIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) During his visit to Panama, Rubio spoke with Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino to emphasize that China’s influence in the Panama Canal was unacceptable, saying the U.S. would be ready to respond if the status quo did not change. China has significant influence in the Panama Canal, owning two ports on either side of the critical seaway. American investment firm Blackrock had planned to buy the ports off of China for $23 billion, but the deal has since been delayed due to Chinese hesitance and Panamanian scrutiny. Additionally, China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Panama, in response to Rubio and the Trump administration’s pressure, gave U.S. warships the ability to travel “first and free” through the canal while increasing U.S. troop presence in its many military installations in the nation. “For decades, out of all the regions in the world, our own region has received the least consistent attention from U.S. policymakers,” Rubio wrote in an April 2024 column for The National Interest. “This cannot continue if we want security, prosperity, and freedom to win out in the Western Hemisphere.” Further down south from Panama, Rubio and the Trump administration have applied pressure on the socialist state of Venezuela. Rubio oversaw the rescue of five Venezuelan opposition members that were trapped in the Argentine Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, after the government charged them with conspiring against President Nicolas Maduro. The five persons had close ties with opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who supported former presidential candidate Edmundo González in the 2024 election. The election was highly controversial due to the government’s denial of the results and the subsequent persecution of González, who fled to Spain to escape Maduro’s influence. Rubio openly called the Maduro regime “illegitimate” after the rescue, saying the dictator’s actions have “undermined Venezuela’s institutions, violated human rights, and endangered our regional security.” “I think what Secretary Rubio is doing with President Trump is placing pressure on the regime while engaging collectively in efforts to protect Americans, secure American interests and isolate the capacity of the regime to disrupt U.S. security,” Fernandez told the DCNF. “It’s a tough situation, and there’s some major challenges for us.” Rubio has also moved to solidify America’s ties with Caribbean nations and sound the alarm over Cuba’s human rights abuses. Additionally, China has reportedly set up at least four spy bases in the communist island nation, some of which are equipped with signal intelligence equipment used to intercept communications from a target location. The secretary met with the heads of state of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Prime Saint Lucia, Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis to discuss continued partnership while singling out Cuba as a target of further containment in early May. Some observers have compared Rubio’s posture in Latin America to the Monroe Doctrine, first coined during the presidency of James Monroe, which emphasized American domination of the Western Hemisphere and the exclusion of Europe from the region. Now, as America deals with a novel foe in China, Fernandez thinks the comparison is fair, but with key differences in the modern world. “If the goal is to protect and assert U.S. interests within our own hemisphere, that at the end of the day, that’s the core of the Monroe Doctrine,” Fernandez told the DCNF. Illegal immigration has become a key focal point of the administration’s diplomatic outreach in the region, such as cooperating with El Salvador to house deported criminal migrants in the maximum security CECOT prison. Rubio met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in February to solidify agreements to help stem the illegal immigration crisis. “Secretary Rubio knows first-hand the important role our region plays in the America First foreign policy agenda,” a senior State Department official told the DCNF. “He was intentional in his selection to visit many countries in our hemisphere during his first international trip.” “Whether it be working with regional allies to deter illegal immigration, designating cartels and gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or holding tyrannical regimes accountable, Secretary Rubio remains focused on making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous,” the official added.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100K – So why are BTC ETF inflows suddenly slowing down?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-hits-100k-so-why-are-btc-etf-inflows-suddenly-slowing-down/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T02:00:37Z

Inflows are back but, why do they feel weaker than before? Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark has reignited excitement across the crypto landscape, with spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs riding the wave of optimism. These U.S.-listed funds, which had recently faced outflows amid tariff-related uncertainty, have swiftly rebounded, attracting significant institutional capital. In just the past two days, i.e., the 7th and the 8th of May, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a combined $260 million, reflecting renewed investor confidence. While the aggressive pace of inflows appears to be leveling off, the sustained demand signals that institutional appetite remains strong as Bitcoin continues to test new highs. However, while Bitcoin has now breached the $100K milestone, the recent ETF inflows haven’t quite matched the intensity seen during previous market recoveries. Back when BTC was still below $100K, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows surge as high as $917 million in response to tariff-related rebounds. In contrast, the most recent data from Farside Investors shows more modest figures: $142.3 million and $117.4 million in inflows on the 7th and the 8th of May, respectively. What stands out, however, is not just the volume but the evolving behavior of major institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity, suggesting a potential shift in strategic positioning. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently dominated daily inflow charts, appears to be losing some steam. After recording a staggering $643.2 million in inflows on the 23rd of April, recent figures show a sharp cooldown, with daily contributions slipping to the $30–70 million range. Analysts suggest this slowdown could reflect a recalibration of investment strategies or signal the end of BlackRock’s initial accumulation phase. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) is showing renewed strength, garnering over $75 million in inflows across just two days. This rebound could help Fidelity reclaim ground in the competitive Bitcoin ETF arena, especially after a week of net outflows. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs continue to draw investor attention, Ethereum [ETH] funds are facing a different reality. On the 8th of May, Ether ETFs recorded outflows for the third consecutive day, with $16.1 million exiting the market, all from BlackRock’s ETHA, while the remaining eight Ether funds saw no activity. Interestingly, Fidelity, though not leading the ETH ETF charge, has taken a strategic leap by advancing into new territory. Its spot Solana [SOL] ETF filing has now been formally recognized by the U.S. SEC, signaling its broader ambition in the digital asset arena. While toppling BlackRock’s dominance won’t be easy, Fidelity’s expanding footprint suggests it’s gearing up for a more aggressive presence in the evolving crypto ETF landscape.

Title: BlackRock expands quantum risk disclosure in amended Bitcoin ETF filing
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-quantum-risk-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T01:00:34Z
Full Content:
Share this article BlackRock has updated its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) prospectus with expanded language on the potential risks posed by quantum computing, adding a detailed discussion to what was previously a brief mention of the technology. The amended prospectus, filed on May 9, includes extensive details about how quantum computing advances could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. The filing notes that advances in quantum computing technology could undermine the viability of many cryptographic algorithms used globally, including those used to secure digital assets like Bitcoin. “If quantum computing is able to advance in that way, there is a risk that quantum computing could result in the cryptography underlying the Bitcoin network becoming ineffective, which, if realized, could compromise the security of the Bitcoin network, or allow a malicious actor to compromise the wallets holding bitcoin owned by the Trust or others on the Bitcoin network, which would result in losses to Shareholders,” the filing reads. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who first reported the changes, noted that such disclosures are routine in SEC filings. “These are just basic risk disclosures. They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that’s being invested in. It’s completely standard,” Seyffart said. The filing notes that while the Bitcoin community is working on quantum-resistant solutions, “there is no guarantee that new quantum-proof architectures will be built and appropriate transitions will be implemented across the network at scale in a timely manner.” BlackRock on Friday also filed an amendment to its iShares Ethereum Trust, adding provisions for in-kind creation/redemption. The filings surfaced after the firm met with SEC staff to discuss implementing staking and parameters for options trading on crypto ETFs. There has been ongoing back-and-forth discussion surrounding quantum computing and how it could pose a risk to Bitcoin’s security. Concerns spiked last December when Google unveiled Willow, its next-generation quantum chip. The company claimed Willow would solve certain computational tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken the world’s most powerful classical supercomputer 10 septillion years. Just a few months later, Microsoft announced its own milestone: a quantum chip called Majorana 1, which it said addresses key scalability challenges that have long held the technology back. These developments have reignited fears in the crypto space about how fast quantum computing is advancing, and whether it could soon threaten the cryptographic foundations that secure Bitcoin and other digital assets. Many in the community voiced immediate concern that increasingly powerful quantum machines might one day crack the encryption protecting older Bitcoin wallets and even modern exchanges. Despite rapid progress, most experts agree that quantum computers aren’t yet powerful or stable enough to pose a real threat to Bitcoin in the short term. For now, these breakthroughs are more theoretical than practical when it comes to breaking public-key cryptography at scale. Still, the industry isn’t waiting around. Many projects are already exploring or implementing quantum-resistant technologies, anticipating the eventual arrival of a “quantum-safe” future. Interestingly, quantum computing may not just pose risks. It could also enhance blockchain security. Last month, researchers from JPMorgan, Quantinuum, and other groups successfully used a quantum computer to generate certifiably random numbers—a breakthrough that could strengthen encryption, improve digital signatures, and make future blockchain systems even more secure.

Title: Platforms, Private Credit Fund and Banks’ Fortunes Are Increasingly Intertwined
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2025/platforms-private-credit-fund-and-banks-fortunes-are-increasingly-intertwined/

Highlights Bank exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), including private equity (PE) and private credit (PC) funds, has increased significantly. The Fed estimates that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds rose from less than $10 billion in 2013 to approximately $300 billion by the end of 2023. The financial system is becoming increasingly interwoven, connecting banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and end customers, increasing banks’ credit and liquidity risks. Private credit exists as an essential part of the capital spectrum, especially for firms that cannot get, or choose not to get, traditional bank channels. The private credit firms — including venture capital companies, buyout funds, hedge funds, direct lenders and others — are in turn significant partners for FinTech platforms that, themselves, extend loans. The capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter’s end customers is increasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across that continuum. In a report by the Boston Fed, research shows that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), a category that includes private equity (PE) and private credit (PC). The data shows that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds are approximately $300 billion, or 14% of large banks’ total lending to NBFIs, as of the end of 2023. The tally was less than $10 billion in 2013. The central bank contends that “understanding the scale and complexity of bank-NBFI connections is important for identifying potential risks to financial stability — that is, the financial system’s ability to continue supplying capital to the economy if strained by shocks.” The PE and PC firms, in turn, put money to work in the economy. But, as the Fed report details, when these firms are hit by shocks, “they tend to draw down their bank lines of credit at a faster rate than firms with only bank credit. This creates a channel through which PC funds may increase banks’ credit and liquidity risks, on balance.” In recent months, PYMNTS has reported on the opportunities and growth industries funded by private credit. AI has been a particular area of increased investment, representing a $1.8 trillion market for funding to help build out data centers and other infrastructure. And in general, banks such as JPMorgan have been ramping up their own efforts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, to increase private credit transactions. HSBC has reportedly been mulling making inroads into the private credit. Within FinTech, last year, for example, SumUp, a U.K. FinTech focused on POS hardware and issuing services, garnered a $1.6 billion loan provided by lenders including Goldman Sachs Asset Management, BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Vista Credit Partners. Earnings results have also underscored the presence of private, institutional investors on platforms, buying loans extended by those digital lenders. Upstart, in one example, has detailed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that “out of the total principal of loans transacted on our marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2025, 60% were purchased by institutional investors.” Personal loans originated in the most recent quarter stood at $2 billion. Earlier this week, Upstart signed a capital arrangement with Fortress, where the private credit firm is purchasing up to $1.2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform. As for the state of these arrangements, Upstart CFO Sanjay Datta said on the call that “these committed partnerships are frankly behaving exactly as designed. The basis of these partnerships was that we essentially committed to navigating the different parts of the macro cycle together … We believe we have the tools to read and react to shifts in the credit risk environment very quickly on behalf of the partners.” The securitization markets are functioning well, the executive said on the call. Upstart CEO Dave Girouard said on that same call that “we’ve had no pullbacks from our private credit … committed capital partners, and we likewise had no pullbacks from banks or credit unions … our credit continues to perform.” LendingClub, in its own earnings report, said that its structured certificates are a “preferred structure for private credit” and represented 29% of the nearly $2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform in the first quarter. Drew LaBenne, CFO of LendingClub, told analysts on the conference call that “the opportunity is massive in the insurance market. And if you think about a lot of the transactions that we’re doing today with asset managers and private credit, a big pool of the money that they’re managing is insurance money.” The Fed paper states: “Private funds may be growing more reliant on bank loans, both by taking larger loan commitments relative to fund assets and by utilizing a higher percentage of those loan commitments.” The read across here is that the interconnectedness, and the leverage, bear watching in an environment where things are functioning well but where the clouds of macro volatility can gather at a moment’s notice.

The meeting followed another encounter on April 1 where BlackRock also discussed staking and ETP rules, but now added tokenization. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock representatives met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force on May 9 to seek guidance on a range of crypto regulatory issues, including tokenization, staking, and approval frameworks for exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to the meeting memo, BlackRock reviewed its digital asset offerings, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the proposed iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The firm used the opportunity to solicit input on how current and future products might be regulated under federal securities laws, particularly as the digital asset market matures. The meeting included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, legal, digital assets, and ETF markets. Following a prior session on April 1, BlackRock continues directly engaging with the SEC on crypto policy matters. Last month, the firm discussed technical elements of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs and shared a detailed document on existing workflows under the current cash model. Additionally, the firm outlined how those systems might adapt to support alternative models for crypto-based funds. BlackRock also outlined its views on incorporating staking features into ETPs, aligning with other recent industry proposals reviewed by the SEC. Staking has become a central issue in ongoing discussions over whether proof-of-stake asset exposure within ETPs can be designed to meet regulatory expectations without compromising liquidity or investor protections. The meeting also addressed tokenization, with BlackRock requesting feedback on how tokenization efforts could be structured within the existing securities framework. Tokenization is the process of representing traditional assets in the blockchain as digital tokens. The firm also suggested interim standards for crypto ETP issuers, asking the SEC to consider codified guidance that might apply ahead of broader rulemaking. BlackRock additionally discussed criteria under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act that could be used to evaluate whether a crypto ETP satisfies regulatory thresholds for exchange listing. These criteria include assessments of market integrity and investor safeguards. Lastly, the meeting with the SEC Crypto Task Force covered options on crypto ETPs, with BlackRock raising technical questions about position and exercise limits. The firm requested clarity on how such limits could be structured regarding liquidity thresholds for the underlying crypto or ETP shares.

Title: The global war on farming gathers pace

Editor Economy Alex Krainer British farmers are pushing back, but the government is preparing large-scale culling of livestock toward the end of 2025 [Originally published in I-System TrendCompass] Over the last few years I’m noticing that the grocery stores where I buy my food are less and less supplied with certain foods, particularly organic meat and periodically milk and eggs. The difference is very obvious and my Carrefour supermarket even reduced the shelf space where these foods are displayed. Certain types of meat that used to be regularly available are no longer are (at all, ever), and I can only find them from specialty butcher shops which thankfully still exist in France (although they are noticeably fewer now than they used to be). This is not an accident but, as the British farmer and activist Mark Byford (a.k.a. the Bowler Hat Farmer) lays out in this (highly recommended) interview, it is part of the global war on farming, comprising a barrage of administrative and regulatory measures designed to make farming unprofitable, incentivizing farmers not to produce food and encouraging them to sell their farms: it’s war on carbon, war on nitrogen, war on bird flu and other viruses, war on Russian fertilizers, inheritance taxes, rewilding schemes, “get out of farming” payouts and burgeoning compliance rules and bureaucracies to oversee it all. For example, Byford explained that if you grow wheat in Britain, you can earn about £160 per acre. It’s hard work and it involves considerable expense. At the same time, the government is promoting the so-called “set-aside” or rewilding schemes and will pay farmers £300-£400 per acre to let weeds grow on their land. For farmers, it’s more income, less expense and less work. Another line of attack has been directed at milk production: farmers are locked into exclusive supply contracts with corporate buyers who often fail to collect the milk. As a consequence, tens of thousands of liters a day are being simply dumped, causing farmers massive financial losses. Apparently, given the nature of their supply contracts, they have no way of recovering these losses. As a result, milk shortages appear at the same time as the farmers are forced to dump about half of their production. Egg shortage has been orchestrated under “bird flu” emergencies, justifying the culling of millions of birds. Food production is also being suffocated through regulatory measures. Active farmers are buried under the burgeoning regulatory requirements, forcing them to spend long hours filing endless forms to be compliant with burgeoning rules and regulations. Many of the new rules, including the “get out of farming payments scheme,” effectively punish or discourage food production while incentivizing the farmers to sell their farms. Farmland is then often bought by global investment behemoths like BlackRock and Vanguard. The result is that livestock is gradually disappearing and food production is shrinking, which is by now obvious to see in our supermarkets. Now there are reports that the UK government is planning a mass culling of livestock towards the end of 2025. According to Byford, similar measures are being pursued in Ireland, the EU as well as in India and many African countries with the effect that today there is 72% less food moving through global distribution chains than in the pre-pandemic period. Most probably, this is all caused by climate change or perhaps Russia, Russia, Russia, or China, China, China. However, there’s also a strange coincidence that all these measures appear to have been planned. A major policy paper, titled “Absolute Zero,” was published on 29 November 2019 as a collaboration between the leading British universities including Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and the Imperial College of London. This was all funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and it laid out the strategy of reaching zero carbon emissions in accordance with the chillingly distopian UK Climate Change Act of 2008. The Absolute Zeros recommended that, “In addition to reducing our energy demand, delivering zero emissions with today’s technologies requires the phasing out of flying, shipping, lamb and beef, blast furnace steel and cement.” It’s interesting that the UK has now shut down its last blast furnace making it the only G7 nation without a steel industry. Meanwhile, as far as the corporate media are concerned, this is a “China, China, China” story, and nobody’s mentioning the “Absolute Zero” agenda. Anyhow, back to farming: the agenda is that between 2020 and 2029, the consumption of beef and lamb must drop by 50% and by 2050 it must be “phased out.” Also, all construction of new buildings must cease by 2050. “Absolute Zero” agenda (note, it was drafted well in advance of the Covid 19 pandemic), has full support and commitment of the British government, the same government that has incentivized billions of pounds to be invested in solar energy and is now planning to spray the skies to dim the sun. Of course, the genius behind Absolute Zero plans have anticipated resistance from proles and peasants of the nation, so they touched upon the behavioral measures that will be necessary: “The changes in behaviour to achieve Absolute Zero are clearly substantial. In principle, these changes could be induced through changing prices and thus providing clear incentives for behaviour to change. The alternative is that the government prohibits certain types of behaviour and regulates production processes.” Evidently, those who set the agenda understand that they must achieve their objectives against the will of the people and that the changes must “be induced.” Thankfully, the deplorable farmers and the proles have other ideas and pushback is building up along with alternative food systems, organized from the bottom up. We can expect the governments in the UK and elsewhere to try and suppress these alternatives, but having or not having food to eat is too important to capitulate to government intimidation. However, broader awareness and support for farmers will be needed in this struggle. Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Million-Dollar Careers, The Elite Seven Figures Club

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Investment Bankers discussing an important deal in a darkly lit wood panel conference room. Many people want to succeed in their careers. Some struggle, and others find ways to do well. There is a small segment of the population who were able to amass financial fortunes for their efforts. Earning an annual income of $1 million or more is a remarkable achievement. This milestone is attainable, but rare. Less than 0.5% of U.S. households earn over $1 million annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data and recent payroll analyses. In high-earning regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area, only about 0.54% of employees reach this threshold. Certain industries are constructed to produce high earners. A confluence of factors like economic dynamics, market demand, having the right skills and being in the right place at the right time helps. The finance sector, encompassing the stock market, hedge funds, and private equity, is a money generating powerhouse. Hedge fund managers who oversee portfolios with assets exceeding $250 million can earn between $500,000 and $3 million annually. This is how it works. Hedge fund managers traditionally are compensated under what is called a "2 and 20" fee structure. This entails a charge of a 2% annual management fee on the fund's assets under management (AUM) and a 20% performance fee on the fund's profits. As their portfolio grows, the higher the payout will be for the manager. According to Institutional Investor, Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, earned approximately $2.6 billion in 2023, making him the third highest-earning hedge fund manager that year. The 2024 North American Private Equity Investment Professional Compensation Survey by Heidrick & Struggles indicates, private equity managing directors and partners typically earn total cash compensation including base salary plus bonus, ranging from $700,000 to $2 million, depending on fund size and performance. Private equity (PE), including firms like BlackRock, is an investment strategy in which PE acquires stakes in other privately or publicly held companies, with the goal of increasing their value and then selling them off for big profits. Investment banking Managing Directors (MDs) at bulge-bracket investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, facilitate large deals like mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs). If successful, this can earn total compensation packages that exceed $1 million per year for the MDs. This includes a base salary typically between $350,000 and $600,000, with bonuses often matching or exceeding base salaries. Real estate is another lucrative area. Top agents in luxury markets like Los Angeles earn huge commissions on multimillion-dollar properties. Luxury real estate agents in Los Angeles and similar markets, typically earn commissions ranging from 2% to 3% per transaction. For a $10 million sale, a 3% commission would be about $300,000. Agents who hustle to sell these high priced homes can hit the one million or more level. However, commission rates are often negotiated, and for high-value properties, agents may accept lower percentages. Professional sports and entertainment mint millionaires through their talent. Elite athletes in the NBA, NFL, and MLB secure contracts worth tens of millions of dollars annually. For example, LeBron James earned a salary of about $48.7 million in 2024, according to Forbes. Additionally, his total earnings, including endorsements, reached around $128 million. LeBron’s endorsement deals alone are estimated at around $80 million annually. A-list actors and entertainers mirror this. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is a US-based labor union for film, television, video games, and commercial performers. Their rates of $2,000–$3,000 per day could potentially total millions. The real big money is in the blockbuster movies and television serieses. Well known actors stars like Dwayne Johnson can earn $20 million per film, per industry data. Influencers and media personalities, like Jim Cramer, can make millions through TV deals and sponsorships, with continuing fast growth in the influencer creator economy valued at $250 billion in 2024 per Goldman Sachs. Entrepreneurship offers a way to wealth. Founders in tech, and Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists can hit it big. Also, mom-and-pop retail, or services can scale to businesses making million-dollar profits. About 1% of U.S. small business owners, roughly 300,000, achieve this annually, per IRS data. Healthcare, especially highly specialized medicine, enables seven-figure incomes, with top neurosurgeons and cardiac surgeons often exceeding $1 million in private practice. This is driven by demand for life-saving procedures, per a 2023 physician compensation study. Corporate leadership is a significant driver, with S&P 500 CEOs earning a median of $17.9 million in 2025 (projected from Equilar’s 2023 figure of $16.3 million), while the top 100 CEOs at firms with over $1 billion in revenue reach a median of $32 million. The highest earners, like the low key profile Jim Anderson, the head of Saxonburg, Pa.-based company Coherent, which makes equipment and products for networks and laser systems, is the new highest-paid CEO in the U.S. with a total salary of $101,497,009 for 2024, according to executive intelligence company Equilar. Moon shots like Elon Musk, heading Tesla, SpaceX, the X-platform, Neuralink and other endeavors may potentially be hitting $1 billion in stock and incentive based pay or more. The tech sector is a major contributor to high earners. Typical compensation packages for senior software engineers and managers at top tech firms like Google, Meta, and Apple, ranges from $200,000 to $500,000. With stock appreciation, stock grants, bonuses and restricted stock units (RSUs), compensation where an employer grants shares of company stock, which vest over a specific period, tied to performance or time with the company, could propel the total package into the seven figure club. Some tech titans who are in a hot space, such as AI, can see $1 million and more in a strong year, often due to large equity grants, RSUs or stock windfalls. One underappreciated factor in these careers is the power of leverage. In finance, earnings scale with assets managed. $1 billion at a 2% fee nets $20 million for the firm, a chunk of which flows to the manager. Tech professionals leverage equity, where RSUs can multiply total compensation during market booms, though this ties earnings to volatile stock performance, a risk often overlooked. In real estate and entrepreneurship, leveraging loans or investor capital can amplify returns. Timing is another critical element. Finance and tech professionals thrive in bull markets, while athletes and entertainers face short peak earning windows. LeBron James’ pivot to a business empire exemplifies the need to diversify early. The path to $1 million is filled with setbacks. This includes failed startups, market crashes, athletes getting injured. Hollywood stars lose their luster or get bad investment advice can quickly make a person lose their one million plus compensation.

Title: What Trump’s Policies Mean for Latin America
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-100-days-office-consequences-for-latin-america-by-jorge-g-castaneda-2025-05
Time Published: 2025-05-09T15:44:51Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office have largely focused on trade and immigration policy. Latin American countries haven’t borne the brunt of these protectionist measures, and in some cases have collaborated with his administration, but that doesn’t mean that they will be immune to the fallout. MEXICO CITY – Latin America has not figured prominently in US President Donald Trump’s foreign and trade policies during his first 100 days in office, despite the appointment of a Latino – Marco Rubio – as Secretary of State. But that does not mean the region has been spared the fallout from his controversial decisions on drugs, immigration, trade, or foreign policy. More worryingly, all signs point to continued upheaval. Trump’s return to the White House has been felt more acutely in Mexico than in any other Latin American country. But many of his most extreme threats, such as mass deportations of Mexicans and other immigrants to the country, have not materialized. This is partly because far fewer people are entering the United States without papers (many of those deported under former US President Joe Biden fell into this category), and partly because finding and expelling undocumented aliens is a logistical nightmare. As a result, the dozens of shelters the Mexican government hastily prepared for deportees remain largely empty, although that could change in the future. Trump’s promised moves against the Mexican drug cartels have also gone nowhere. Trump has designated some of them as foreign terrorist organizations – thereby empowering his administration to impose economic penalties and take military action against these groups – but has stopped short of implementing such measures. While drone flights and spy-plane incursions into Mexican airspace have increased, these were already taking place under the Biden administration. As for trade, keeping track of each new tariff announcement – and its subsequent pause – for a country like Mexico, which has received “special” treatment from Trump, is undoubtedly difficult. True, Mexico was exempt from Trump’s most recent round of “reciprocal” tariffs, and the 10% baseline tariff imposed during the 90-day pause. But the country remains subject to a 25% tariff on all exports that do not comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, allegedly to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration, as well as 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and auto parts. Other countries may have it worse, but Mexico is by no means insulated from Trump’s trade war. Several Central and South American countries have also experienced the whiplash of Trump’s on-off trade war. The “reciprocal” tariffs were particularly jarring for the 10 other countries – including Chile, Colombia, and Peru – that have signed free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, even if their rates were comparatively low. The cozy relationship between Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Trump was not even enough to insulate the country, which also has an FTA with the US, from this blitz. Others, like Brazil, are suffering from the 25% tariff on steel. Moreover, the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for free trade has also dashed Argentina’s hopes of signing its own FTA with the US. More importantly, though, many Central American countries are cooperating with the administration on immigration. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Nicaragua have agreed to accept non-national deportees from the US. While the most highly publicized example is the roughly 200 Venezuelans who were removed from America and sent to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador, there are many others. So far, deportation numbers have remained low, largely for the same reasons as in the case of Mexico, but could increase soon. But these partnerships are nothing new. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – the “Northern Triangle” – have long functioned as “safe third countries” for the US and will continue to do so. Our Forward Thinkers list recognizes and spotlights intellectual innovators poised to shape international debates in the years ahead. It brings together 30 influential individuals from academia, policymaking, civil society, and the private sector — voices challenging conventional wisdom and blazing a new path. Meet the Forward Thinkers Panama has fared much worse, becoming a battleground for the Sino-American rivalry. Trump wants the Panama Canal back, and no one knows how far he is willing to go to achieve this goal. An apparent Panamanian concession – the sale of two Chinese-owned ports to BlackRock – seems to have been held up by the Chinese government. The intensifying geopolitical and economic conflict between the superpowers bodes ill for the isthmic country’s future. Trump has also taken aim at Venezuela and Cuba. The administration’s initial ambivalence toward Venezuela – Trump’s team was negotiating deportation flights with President Nicolás Maduro’s regime while simultaneously ending Chevron’s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil – was quickly replaced by a campaign of “maximum pressure.” This includes a 25% tariff on countries that import Venezuelan oil and the extension of existing sanctions. Rumors are swirling that Trump’s negotiators have reached an agreement with the Venezuelan opposition, whereby – in exchange for ousting Maduro – the US would be granted unfettered access to Venezuela’s immense oil reserves. But these reports have proved hard to substantiate. In any case, Trump and Rubio are unlikely to moderate their aggressive approach, even if harsher sanctions increase the number of Venezuelans fleeing the country. The same is true for Cuba. Tightening the screws will only deepen the island’s misery, fueling the exodus of Cubans, some of whom will flee to the US. But Rubio’s Cuban-American heritage will probably prevent him from embracing a realistic strategy. Instead, the administration may strengthen the economic embargo on Cuba, further restricting travel and the flow of remittances. And if Trump imposes secondary sanctions, like those imposed on Venezuela, Cubans will only become more impoverished and desperate. Trump’s attention may be focused elsewhere, but this does not mean that Latin American countries are immune to the consequences of his decisions. The intensifying US-China conflict, the threat of a global recession triggered by the incipient trade war, and the weakening of international institutions traditionally will have far-reaching consequences for the region – even for countries that have stayed off the US president’s radar.

Title: Abu Dhabi’s IHC, BlackRock Start $1 Billion Reinsurance Firm

The yet-to-be-named firm will launch with more than $1 billion in initial equity commitments and aims to manage $10 billion in liabilities, backed by partnerships with BlackRock and Abu Dhabi-based asset manager Lunate, according to a statement. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone, ADGM, the firm will be chaired by Sultan Al Jaber — the United Arab Emirates’ minister for industry and advanced technology. It will be led by Mark Wilson, the former chief executive officer of Aviva Plc and AIA Group Ltd. BlackRock will provide an initial minority investment and will support the venture with insurance asset management, advisory services and technology. Lunate will serve as a partner, offering its experience across public and private markets. The new firm will make use of AI as a core part of the strategy, enhancing underwriting capabilities by improving the quality and speed of risk assessments. BlackRock received a commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last year, and the latest deal deepens its ties to the emirate. The firm is partnering with MGX on a partnership that aims to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. Lunate, meanwhile, acquired a stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines from BlackRock and KKR & Co. last year. IHC, MGX, and Lunate are part of a vast empire overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — the UAE’s national security adviser and a brother to its president. The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, has been pushing to diversify away from its dependence on oil. It’s expanding into areas like technology, finance and health care. Home to three sovereign wealth funds that control close to $1.7 trillion in assets, Abu Dhabi has become a magnet for international investors. At the same time, the UAE has pushed global financial giants to set up local partnerships to help build the domestic economy.

Title: Stripe's Quiet Revolution: Rebuilding Global Finance with Stablecoin Accounts
URL: https://wisefree.tistory.com/554
Time Published: 2025-05-09T12:46:58Z
Full Content:
블록체인 In May 2025, global payments platform Stripe quietly signaled a powerful shift in the financial landscape. Stripe has launched a stablecoin-based financial account service in over 101 countries worldwide. This move is more than just a new feature-it’s a bold statement of Stripe’s ambition to reshape the global financial system from the ground up. In this post, we’ll explore why Stripe introduced this service, the technology and strategy behind it, and what impact this transformation could have on our daily lives. Despite decades of innovation, global finance still faces persistent structural challenges. Stripe aims to address these hurdles by leveraging blockchain and stablecoin technology. Their goal: to build an infrastructure where anyone with an internet connection can safely and affordably manage dollar-denominated assets-no matter where they are in the world. Stripe’s new financial account service offers several key features: ✅ Available in 101 CountriesBusinesses in most parts of the world can now open and manage these accounts. ✅ Integration of On-Chain & Traditional Financial NetworksFunds can be sent and received via both conventional banking rails (ACH, wire transfers) and blockchain networks (such as Ethereum), giving users unprecedented flexibility. ✅ Stablecoin SupportThe accounts support Circle’s USDC and Stripe’s own USDB stablecoin, enabling both digital asset transactions and secure asset custody. ✅ Visa Card Integration Coming SoonStripe plans to launch Visa debit and prepaid cards linked to stablecoin balances, allowing users to spend their digital dollars in the real world-imagine buying coffee with USDC. Through its $1.1 billion acquisition of blockchain infrastructure provider Bridge, Stripe now operates its own stablecoin, USDB. In essence, USDB is a “dedicated digital dollar” for Stripe’s business clients, enabling global fund management without the need for a traditional bank account. Stripe’s move is significant not just for Web3 users, but for the broader financial industry: 1. Streamlined B2B Global TransactionsExporters, SaaS providers, and freelancer platforms can dramatically reduce both time and fees for cross-border payments. 2. Integration of Digital Assets with the Real EconomyWith Visa card integration, users will soon be able to receive salaries, dine out, and shop using stablecoins. 3. New Opportunities for the Financially UnderservedEven those without bank accounts can participate in global commerce through Stripe. For startups and freelancers in developing countries, this opens up a new pathway to dollar-based financial services. Stripe is no longer just a payment API provider. With this announcement, it is positioning itself as a “global digital financial infrastructure company.” This strategy goes beyond a technical upgrade-it challenges the very foundations of the traditional banking system, the SWIFT network, and even national currency regimes. Stripe’s launch of stablecoin accounts marks the quiet beginning of a monumental shift. This isn’t just about Web3, fintech, or payments-it’s about redefining the very infrastructure of global finance. It will be fascinating to watch how Stripe expands this strategy, and how other payment giants like PayPal and Adyen respond. Notably, PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, signaling that the race to build the next-generation financial stack is well underway. 소프트웨어에 날개를 달자.

Title: The Post-Future Has Arrived in Argentina—and It Looks Remarkably Like the Past

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Javier Milei’s right-wing government is racking up new debt with the IMF. It’s part of a vicious cycle the country seems unable to break. Buenos Aires—The Basilica de San José de Flores didn’t appear in most guidebooks to Argentina prior to 2013. Located in a working-class neighborhood of Buenos Aires, its current structure was completed in 1883 by the Italian architects Emilio Lombardo and Benito Panuzzi, just off Plaza General Pueyrredón. Although its interior is ornate, with ubiquitous gold leaf, the church is a modest structure, with a small apse and sanctuary, and several dozen rows of well-worn pews stretching across its nave. In the years since Jorge Mario Bergoglio became pope, however, the basilica has become a minor tourist attraction. It was here that Francis attended service during his infancy and adolescence, and here that he ultimately decided to dedicate his life to God. On April 21, hundreds of Argentines packed the church for evening mass and to pay their respects to the newly departed pontiff. Inside, the vestibule was standing room only, and the air was thick with the smells of perfume, body odor, and the faint aroma of incense. The crowd was solemn but unified, holding each other’s hands (or in my case, a finger, while I clutched my notebook and phone) during the recitation of “Our Father.” Outside the church, it was another story entirely. Shortly after the mass’s completion, Argentine Vice President Victoria Villarruel beat a hasty exit down the basilica’s steps with a security detail to loud and increasingly raucous calls of “traitor.” For an instant, it felt as though she might be physically assaulted. A separate brawl would erupt several minutes later, although by then the vice president was long gone. “It’s a tragedy,” reflected Andrea Prado, a 52-year-old sociologist from Buenos Aires province, after the dust-up. “[In Francis], we’ve lost one of the last great humanists and advocates for the poor. Now the far right gets to cover up all the atrocities that it’s committing. This is the best thing that could have happened to [Argentine President Javier] Milei.” Less than 18 months since the self-styled anarcho-capitalist took office, Argentina finds itself in a political, economic, and social torpor. Monthly inflation has fallen sharply, from 25.5 percent in January 2024 to 3.7 percent in March of this year; so has the poverty rate, from 52.9 percent in the first six months of 2024 to 38.9 percent at year’s end. Yet both figures are somewhat misleading. Inflation jumped in early 2024 after a series of tax cuts and unfunded spending measures from the outgoing Peronist government, and then skyrocketed, along with poverty, on the heels of an 18 percent currency devaluation in August 2024 and another 54 percent currency devaluation that Milei announced two days after assuming power. That has set his administration up to harvest some low-hanging fruit; a March report from the Institute of Socioeconomic Statistics and Trends in Córdoba province found that “social indicators continue to show no significant improvement.” Across the country, the most popular television series is an adaptation of H.G. Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López’s classic comic El Eternauta—a sci-fi survival saga set in a post-apocalyptic Buenos Aires. Salaries and pensions have stabilized in dollar terms, but the former has failed to keep pace with inflation, while the latter has lagged well below the breadline. (Last September, the Argentine president used his veto power to nullify a pension increase.) At the same time, the government has taken to violently suppressing its retirees, who protest its draconian austerity measures each Wednesday in front of Congress. Now, after mandating a loan via executive order before a deal was even in place, Milei and Economy Minister Luis Caputo have taken on even more debt with the International Monetary Fund in the form of a $20 billion line of credit. That the IMF is extending an economic lifeline to an outspoken Trump ally at the United States’ behest seems indisputable. More devastating for Argentina and liberal democracies more broadly is that few within a politically exhausted opposition can articulate any plausible alternative to this rigged game—one whose rules are being bent in real time to the cruelty and caprice of a fractious but empowered far-right international. “Thinking about alternatives to this scenario is its own form of trap,” explained Itai Hagman, a congressman representing the city of Buenos Aires and an economic adviser to former Peronist presidential hopeful Juan Grabois. “Milei inherited a complicated macroeconomic and social situation, but it was his own decisions that have left him between a rock and a hard place. If it weren’t for the bloodletting at the beginning of 2024 or the record exchange rate appreciation and depletion of Central Bank reserves in the second half of the year to maintain the value of the peso, the government could have avoided falling into the clutches of the IMF, which is, by definition, a lender of last resort.” On April 12, the IMF Executive Board formally approved an Extended Fund Facility arrangement with Argentina—the 23rd in the nation’s history—with an immediate disbursement of $12.3 billion. The loan, at least in theory, is meant to help address the country’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities, which include negative foreign currency reserves and inflation running at 56 percent annually, while opening the country to international markets in a “timely” fashion, per the IMF. The following Monday, the Milei government lifted a majority of currency restrictions known locally as the cepo. These restrictions are used to protect reserves during periods of instability, but have served as an impediment to foreign investment, with many companies unwilling to navigate the country’s parallel exchange rates. In doing so, the administration has created a new floating scheme in which the dollar can be valued anywhere from 1000 to 1400 pesos. “I don’t totally get why the IMF keeps lending money to Argentina,” Michael Paarlberg, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and Bernie Sanders’s Latin America adviser during the 2020 Democratic primary, told The Nation. “I understand that it’s a major economy, and it would be bad if it went under. But it’s also the worst sovereign debtor in world history. The Fund is a little like Charlie Brown with the football.” “This pattern keeps repeating itself,” he continued. “A conservative gets into office and loads the country up with unsustainable debt. Then the Peronists return to power and either default on the debt or renegotiate it.” Just seven years earlier, during Trump’s first term, then–Argentine President Mauricio Macri secured a $57 billion loan from the IMF—the largest in the institution’s history. At the time, the Fund reasoned that this massive infusion of capital would stabilize the Argentine economy and lay the groundwork for foreign investment. Instead, the country’s GDP shrank 2.6 percent in 2018 and 2 percent in 2019 as the center-right administration implemented a series of IMF-directed austerity measures. Macri served a single, turbulent term, punctuated by multiple general strikes, before he was succeeded by the Peronist Alberto Fernández, who canceled the final $13 billion tranche of the credit line shortly after assuming office. The IMF has hardly needed to attach any strings to its latest loan. Since entering the Casa Rosada, Milei, an acolyte of Austrian economists Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, with an almost religious veneration of fiscal balance, has launched an assault on government spending on a scale that the young coders at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could only fantasize about. (Indeed, as The Nation has previously reported, the Argentine president’s slash-and-burn campaign has served as a model for Elon Musk’s embattled government task force in the United States.) At the beginning of April, the Milei administration had fired or failed to renew the contracts of more than 42,000 workers—approximately 8.4 percent of the government labor force, according to its newly forged Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation. These layoffs have included thousands of workers at the Childhood, Adolescence, and Family Secretariat, which is responsible for administering a range of welfare services. The government has also made steep cuts to public education, while axing programs designed to provide support to women escaping domestic abuse. Along with the marginalized, Milei’s cuts have been especially punishing for the elderly, who have seen medication costs balloon and pensions fail to keep pace with the increased cost of living altogether. A report earlier this year from Argentina’s Center for Political Economy (CEPA, by its Spanish acronym) found that the government spent 19 percent less on pensions in January 2025 than it did in January 2023, during the previous administration. This has led to regular demonstrations that only seem to be intensifying. On March 12, tensions finally boiled over when local football fans lent their support to the retirees’ regular protest. Police in riot gear injured more than 600 and arrested dozens while nearly killing a photographer, Pablo Grillo, who was struck in the head with a tear gas canister. The crackdown, the most violent since the crisis of 2001, has drawn criticism from human rights organizations, including Amnesty International. In May, the government raised the minimum monthly pension by 3.7 percent to just over 366,000 pesos, including a 70,000-peso bonus, or approximately $320. Milei, meanwhile, has seen his approval ratings slump to below 42 percent in the wake of a scandal known locally as “Criptogate” that cost investors in excess of $250 million after he promoted a memecoin on his X feed in February. (Congress has since formed a commission to investigate what the administration knew, and when it knew it.) A report the following month from the pollster Zuban Córdoba & Associates found that 63 percent of Argentines already held a negative view of the IMF. Every Wednesday, Ramon Piriz, 66, makes the 50-kilometer trip from Buenos Aires province to demonstrate in front of Congress. On April 16, he wore an Argentine flag tied around his neck like a cape and carried a sign that read, in Spanish, “I’ve never seen so many brave people without weapons and so many armed cowards.” A retired metallurgical worker and the father of four adult children, Piriz acknowledged that he’s struggling to make ends meet on his government pension, despite receiving more than the minimum monthly allowance. “These salaries are a misery,” he lamented. “A lot of people say that the previous government was a disaster. And it’s true, it was bad. But under Nestor and Cristina [Fernández de Kirchner], salaried employees were always earning one or two points above inflation. We lived with dignity. I should be at home with my grandkids, enjoying my retirement. I’m too old for this.” “We’re still paying the price for Macri’s enormous loan, and now Milei is taking on even more debt,” he added. “We have no idea where that money will go. All we know is that Argentina remains at the mercy of lenders like the IMF.” Gregg Gonsalves Aaron Regunberg Books & the Arts / David Klion Books & the Arts / Nathan Taylor Pemberton That evening, I learned that the Argentine Federal Police had pepper-sprayed a segment of demonstrators that included several retirees. If Piriz is skeptical about the government’s latest arrangement, it’s not without reason. When the IMF engaged the Macri administration in 2018, it trampled its own bylaws by extending a loan that exceeded 50 percent of its lending capacity. That money was not used to build new schools or hospitals or to repair Argentina’s decaying infrastructure. Instead, it served to finance a capital flight from the country—another violation of the IMF’s own terms and conditions. What’s worse, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank and a onetime official in both the Treasury Department and National Security Council during Trump’s first term, subsequently acknowledged that the line of credit was a favor to one of the president’s former business partners and a right-of-center head of state seeking reelection. Seven years and one Democratic administration later, the IMF’s mask of neutrality has slipped clean off. According to an April 24 report from Bloomberg, the Fund ultimately approved its latest loan to Argentina despite “concerns” from its board of directors about extending yet another line of credit to its single biggest debtor. Prior to the latest deal, the country owed more than $40 billion to the international lender, representing approximately 30 percent of its total debt. In Bloomberg’s telling, some within the board felt the deal was “muscled through by the Fund’s management,” and that the decision was “driven more by politics than policy.” The report additionally noted that the agency may be eager to prove its political utility after the president ordered a review of the United States’ continued participation in international bodies like the IMF. Recent developments would appear to bear out these findings. On April 14, as Trump was ramping up his trade war with China and much of the world, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Buenos Aires to lend his support for the loan and offer praise for Milei’s economic reforms. A little more than a week later, Bessent went one step further, affirming that the United States would extend Argentina an Exchange Stabilization Fund directly if an “external shock” threatened the country’s economic recovery. He added that the United States was trying to “keep from happening what has happened on the African continent” with China. Two days after that, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, made an unusually political statement, urging Argentina to “stay the course” in its midterm elections this November. Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist who previously sided with a Peronist administration during its debt negotiations with the hedge fund BlackRock in 2020, was subsequently seen wearing a chain-saw pin on her lapel—a gift from Deregulation Minister Federico Sturzenegger. (Milei, who campaigned on dismantling the Argentine state, is often seen brandishing a personalized chain saw at rallies and other political events.) The Justicialist Party, which constitutes the largest opposition bloc, has since denounced the IMF director for “electoral interference,” accusing her of encouraging the Argentine people to vote for Milei’s candidates later this year. Georgieva, for her part, maintains that she was speaking to the country’s politicians. “This is a transparently political loan and an unprecedented decision on the part of the Fund,” Juan Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires, told The Nation. “The Milei administration has put out several signs that it is anti-China and pro-Trump, and this is its reward. But it goes beyond that. Argentina has undergone a new experiment in austerity, far beyond anything Macri achieved or even attempted during his term in office. I believe that the IMF and the US are convinced that if this government performs well in the midterms, its radical reforms will gain a new kind of legitimacy.” “The United States has lost its sphere of influence in Latin America,” he continued. “It’s lost control culturally, economically, and politically. No one looks at the US anymore as a beacon of democracy or a city on a hill. All it has are its military bases. There are no more carrots, only sticks. So, when a country subjugates itself to Washington like this, it’s eager to claim victory, even if it’s only symbolic.” Perhaps the remaining question, then, is whether Milei’s gamble on a US empire displaying visible signs of dementia will pay off. Can the IMF’s investment help return Argentina to something resembling economic normalcy? Or is it simply being used to prop up the peso through the next election cycle—after which some form of collapse is all but inevitable? “The fundamentals of Argentina were problematic before, and they remain problematic,” offered Ernesto Calvo, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland and a specialist in Argentina. “Growth is an issue. But I think the most significant challenge for the country is that it has no currency reserves. When the economy picks up, people start to exit by exchanging pesos for dollars. When it falters, people do the same to safeguard what they have. Eventually, not just investors but consumers and producers will run to the dollar. I don’t think anyone has any illusions that things are going to last.” “Will Milei’s policy work?” he asked rhetorically. “If you were to throw a coin a million times, it might stand on its edge once or twice and keep standing. Maybe that happens this time. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s possible.” Hagman’s assessment is more damning still. “Even if this libertarian experiment ‘succeeds’ on its own terms, it will produce an economy that is profoundly more unequal and doomed to underdevelopment.” On Saturdays, Calle Carlos H. Perette in the shantytown of Villa 31 is lined with vendors selling all manner of goods: secondhand clothing, sneakers, cleaning products, lotions, cast-off children’s toys, some of them worse for wear, and piles upon piles of fruits and vegetables. Officially, the barrio, which is among the poorest in Buenos Aires, is named for Father Carlos Mugica, a Catholic priest and social activist who was assassinated in 1974 by the infamous Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, two years before the military junta took power. Although she has lived in Villa 31 since she was 18, Viviana Rodriguez, now 53, was born and baptized in the Northern province of Jujuy. This presented a problem when she first moved to Buenos Aires. Because these baptisms were often performed in fields and small villages, she lacked the certificate required for confirmation and communion. Fortunately, a local priest was willing to perform all three acts at once. “I didn’t realize it was Bergoglio all those years ago until he died,” Rodriguez told me. “I couldn’t believe it.” When I spoke with Rodriguez in April 2024 for The Nation, she was running a comedor or soup kitchen off Calle Evita. Approximately one year later, the space remains open to the neighborhood, but it exists only as a merendero, where local children can enjoy some cookies and maybe a glass of milk. Of the neighborhood’s five soup kitchens, two have closed, and the three that remain now only offer evening snacks once a week. “They took everything. Everything,” she said of the Milei administration. “Even the small salary we collected to run the comedor.” Rodriguez noted that Villa 31 had changed dramatically over the last year. Her neighbors could no longer rely on the city’s drainage system, paint their homes bright greens and lavenders, or repair the electric cables that hang above the streets like an unruly spider web. All that funding was gone. She had also observed a sharp uptick in the number of families living on the street, as well as a mounting desperation among its residents, several of whom had resorted to cardboard collection and, in some cases, crime. Rodriguez herself acknowledged that she had begun selling empanadas to survive. “I feel as though I’m entering a depression, and I don’t know where to turn,” she said, her voice trembling. “If my debts catch up with me, it’s chaos.” Beneath the Dr. Arturo Umberto Illia highway, which runs along the edge of Villa 31 and connects the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires to the Obelisk downtown, there is a monument to Mugica, or “Padre Nacho” as Rodriguez affectionately called him, replete with a mosaic of the priest praying to the Virgin Mary. As she explained to a group of 30-some-odd volunteer students, it was here that the cura villero delivered mass. (Mugica’s remains were later moved to nearby Cristo Obrero parish at the behest of Bergoglio, then the Archbishop of Buenos Aires.) That afternoon in April, reggaeton blared across the courtyard from an unseen speaker, and two teams of women banged a soccer ball around an adjacent cancha (court). More than 50 years removed from Mugica’s murder, after a dictatorship, a triumphant return to democracy, and a backslide into authoritarianism, with 11 IMF deals in between, Argentina’s future still looked very much like its past.

Title: A once-niche market for secondhand stakes in private funds is booming. What it's like to work in secondaries.

There's one corner of the private investment world benefiting from the Trump bump going bust: Secondaries. "Secondaries" professionals buy stakes in privately held funds from investors looking to cash out early. They have been busy of late, closing a record $162 billion in deals last year, according to asset manager BlackRock. Demand could ratchet up again this year as investors look to raise cash to protect against the financial fallout of some of Trump's policies. "I always joke there aren't any bad times for secondaries," Matthew Roche, a partner at secondaries firm StepStone told BI. "There are some really good times for secondaries, and this is one of them." Uncertainty around Trump's tariffs has slowed already sluggish dealmaking, which is expected to lead to even more private equity investors looking to exit funds that have yet to make distributions. Large investors could also turn to the secondaries market to raise cash in the face of a volatile stock market It's not just tariffs. The endowments of Harvard and Yale are in the process of selling private equity stakes amid a federal crackdown on university funding. While Harvard's sales process began last fall, according to someone with knowledge of the sale, and Yale said it's been in process "for many months," the sales come at a time of growing uncertainty for university finances. As this niche industry takes center stage, it raises questions about the people and firms behind the deals. What firms specialize in secondaries investments? What is the job like, and how does it differ from other financial industry jobs? We spoke to investors, recruiters, and a lawyer with deep secondaries experience to understand what private equity's hottest strategy does every day. The secondary market has existed almost as long as private equity itself, but it was long viewed as a fringe strategy. Nowadays, it's considered a core strategy, making up the bulk of assets for some firms, including French private equity firm Ardian, which boasts the world's largest secondaries platform, north of $97 billion in assets managed. Other key players include Lexington Partners, HarbourVest, and StepStone. It's also become a must-have strategy for any megafund, with Apollo raising $5.4 billion in a debut fund that closed this year. Blackstone, which acquired its secondaries business, Strategic Partners, from Credit Suisse in 2013, is now the second-largest secondaries investor in the world. Goldman Sachs' asset management unit also has a fund. Secondaries investors are a category of private-equity professional, but rather than finding companies to turn around, they are responsible for locating, assessing, and executing private fund transactions, sometimes with the help of investment banks like Evercore or Jefferies. Like other private equity pros, they are using money raised from investors. The secondaries industry raised a record $50 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Preqin. The goal is to buy shares at a discount to their future value. The traditional secondaries deal is led by investors looking to cash out. These deals are known as "LP-led" deals. Increasingly, the industry has been transacting deals on behalf of buyout firm sponsors, known as "GP-led" deals, as more private equity firms struggle to make distributions to impatient investors. The secondaries business is "fast-paced," said Keith Brittain, cohead of Hamilton Lane's $24 billion secondaries platform. It's not high-frequency trading, as deals can take weeks or months from start to finish, but there are many more transactions in secondaries than in the world of corporate buyouts. "Even in a two-year associate program at a traditional large/mega fund buyout, you're lucky if you get to see one deal from start to finish," said Alix Connors, a principal at recruiting firm Opus Advisors. Roche said some incoming associates at StepStone came to the firm for a change of pace "Our recent junior hires appreciate that every day can be different: different sponsors, different sectors, and different companies, with many active deals at all times," Roche said. Holly McCarthy, founder of Opus Advisors, compared the workload to a "sample platter" of "sizes, sectors, and strategies.""You can work on a tech venture deal in the morning, a megafund buyout deal by lunch, and a real estate deal in the afternoon," McCarthy said. Secondaries can also offer a bit more work-life balance than corporate buyout investing. "You have a bit more control over your calendar," McCarthy said. Connors said buyouts can be a bit like "banking 2.0" with a highly demanding, intense workload. Secondaries offer more "predictability," she said, though the recent increase in activity has likely led to longer hours. And while the pay is below that of a buyout fund star, it's not by much. "You might earn slightly less, but the trade-off in deal reps and lifestyle is worth it," McCarthy said. But don't expect that you're going to always be home for dinner. Schedules can still be "inconsistent," said Brittain. "Like many transaction and investment-oriented jobs, you don't always have control of timelines." The secondary investor is focused primarily on financial modeling, research, and closing deals. It's for those who want to underwrite versus meeting with CEOs and running businesses. Brittain said secondary investors who buy a share of a fund must do financial due diligence on the overall fund, including the deals in the fund and the private equity manager. On the GP-led side, diligence is even more thorough. "You're not underwriting 20 assets or 200 assets, you're underwriting one or a small number of companies," Brittain said. You also get a chance to look under the hood of other private equity firms."You have to underwrite the quality of the GP," Brittain said. "Can they buy well? Can they exit well?" Jump to

Title: Finally, the BOAK (after decades), K.M. and Meloni for trains, Greek companies in Turkey, where Ethniki is looking to buy, the Indian competitors of Aegean

Hello, so just to say something positive for a change, after a few decades the BOAK is finally being signed today in Crete with lights and torches (GEK TERNA) in the presence of Mitsotakis—I imagine that since it’s nearby, he’ll also pop over to his house in Chania for a swim. Announcements on Monday Meanwhile, Kyriakos Kyranakis’s visit yesterday at noon to the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Salvini and the inspection he then conducted at Italian railway facilities have a rich backstory, but announcements are expected to be made on Monday by Mitsotakis and Meloni from Palazzo Chigi, at the rescheduled Intergovernmental Conference between the two countries. In any case, Kyranakis’s request to his counterpart was for the Italians to seriously invest in new train sets, while the Italians, in turn, are asking us to invest in the network and in safety standards. The consequences for the Rectors I wrote to you yesterday about the government interventions in the universities, but let me add one more piece of information: the deadline for rectors to submit safety plans for their universities is the end of July. Also, by the end of the year they must have drawn up Internal Regulations, which are essentially the constitutional charter of a university. Rectors who don’t “play ball” will face administrative sanctions, even pay cuts, if they choose to resist, although the Ministry of Education estimates that a common ground will be found. The mission to Turkey Deputy Foreign Minister Tasos Chatzivasileiou has been in Istanbul since yesterday; today he will meet with his counterpart Mehmet Kemal Bozay, and then the two of them will address the Greece–Turkey Business Conference. The organization of the conference is being handled by Enterprise Greece, the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, SEV, SEVE, and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, while Mr. Chatzivasileiou is accompanied by top executives from major players in Greek business. Among others, there are representatives from Metlen, Base Metal of the HALCOR group, Europa Aluminium, Swissport, Elbak, Pobuca, and Sky Express. The National Bank, the next step, and the dilemma That the National Bank of Greece is preparing an acquisition move aimed at boosting its revenues in anticipation of further interest rate cuts is well known and already priced in by the market. Efforts in domestic asset management don’t seem to be yielding results. At the same time, glances toward Italy (from all banks) haven’t produced any outcome, as entry into the Italian banking market is neither easy nor straightforward, while the insurance sector—currently in turmoil—is proving more accessible. Ergo and NN appear more receptive, especially the former, which has caught the eye of more than one bank, and Groupama could also be a viable option. One issue complicating matters for the National Bank is the special rights held by the state, namely the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), which remain in place despite the reduction of its stake from 40.4% to 8.39%. The National Bank isn’t worried about whether it will happen or not, because there is a vague initial “OK” from the ESM. However, the relevant legislative provision must be drafted, the ESM must agree to it, and then it must pass through Parliament. The problem is that acquisitions are typically handled within a tight circle of top management—at most three to five executives, such as the CEO, the CFO, etc. But the special rights of the state involve the HCAP board members in the plan, thus widening the circle, since advisors, lawyers, and others are already in the game alongside the bank executives. In mergers and acquisitions, however, you are obliged to act quickly to close the initial deal. In such a case, you take the risk of convincing the special-rights shareholder after the fact, who views the matter from their own (different) perspective and won’t be especially happy if they feel they’ve been ignored. Avramar’s “overcoat” and Amerra’s obstacles We’ve entered May and the sale of Avramar to the Arabs of Aqua Bridge remains pending. The UAE fund and the selling banks initially expected to have a deal by the end of April or early May, but it is said that Amerra Capital, the other shareholder along with Mubadala, is creating obstacles. The American capital initially acquired Andromeda from Global Finance and then, together with Mubadala, bought Nireus and Selonda to form Avramar, the biggest player in Mediterranean aquaculture. Amerra and its executives ran Avramar and drove it onto the rocks, prompting the banks to step in again to find a buyer. And while Aqua Bridge is waiting, Amerra reportedly is setting conditions that are hard to accept. Logically, a solution will be found and it’s said to be near, as all sides want the matter to be concluded smoothly. The good news is that under the new management, things have gotten back on track and Avramar has stabilized, increasing its revenues and improving its metrics. Dividend and forecasts for Aegean Aegean’s stock is steadily climbing, reaching 12-month highs and closing yesterday at €12.70. The airline is benefiting, among other factors, from the positive start to the tourism season and from declining oil prices. Management wants to capitalize on the momentum, which remains positive despite broader international uncertainties, and this year will increase its offered capacity by 1.9 million seats in 2025—a growth rate higher than the European industry average. For the full year, AEGEAN plans to offer 21.5 million seats, with routes spanning 47 countries and 249 destinations. Naturally, there’s also the dividend factor, with Aegean standing out among listed companies by distributing €0.80 per share (€0.76 net), representing a gross yield of over 6%, one of the highest on the board. In a few days, specifically on Tuesday 20/5, the ex-dividend date is set, and payment will begin on 26/5. Aegean’s Indian Competitor And since we are on the topic of Aegean, I should mention that the airline’s management plans to enter the Indian market by the end of 2026 will not be a walk in the park. Aegean’s plans for this particular route will have to contend with the presence of a competitor. The Indian airline IndiGo also intends to start flights to and from Athens in 2026. It is a low-cost carrier based near New Delhi that serves 63% of passenger traffic in India. The company’s CEO, Peter Elbers, is in Athens and even met with Kyriakos Mitsotakis yesterday. IndiGo does not currently operate flights to EU airports, and its first European presence will begin in Athens, with Geneva as a second target. Additionally, note that it expects to take delivery of new A321 aircraft. OPAP Confirms Its Reputation OPAP’s stock is a classic investment choice for those who believe in steady economic growth and expect high dividend returns. One of the characteristics of OPAP’s stock behavior so far is that whenever it “cuts” a dividend, the stock drops for a few sessions, allowing investors to increase their positions at a lower price, only for the stock to regain its momentum shortly afterward. This is exactly what happened last Monday ahead of the distribution of the remaining dividend (€0.80 per share) for 2024. The stock declined, providing an opportunity for those who wanted to invest at a lower price, and as of yesterday, it returned to €19.40 with a market capitalization of €7.2 billion. Bank Guarantees, the Eldorado for Insurance Companies The explosive increase in large public works assignments, aided by the Development Fund, the NSRF, and the Public Investment Program (PIP), has created a demand for the issuance of bank guarantees, which are necessary for taking on these projects. While banks play a leading role in issuing guarantees, recently insurance companies with strong reinsurance backing and the necessary licensing (notable examples include Interamerican and Europa Insurance) have also increased their participation in issuing guarantees. There are also other examples, such as the smaller Euroins Insurance, which belongs to the Eurohold Group. Over the last 7 months, Euroins has changed its management structure, appointed Greek CEO Angeliki Mouratidou, quickly restructured its automobile insurance department—its core activity—and focused on guaranteeing smaller projects, which has boosted turnover by 30% compared to last year, as well as profitability. The New Investment Fund of the HCAP Its name is IIF (Infrastructure & Innovation Fund), and it will be the new specialized subsidiary of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), aimed at investing in key economic sectors of Greece, particularly in infrastructure, innovative businesses, green transition, and digitalization of the economy. Bureaucratic procedures are being finalized, the absorption of the HCAP portfolio was slightly more complicated than initially planned, but by early June, the IIF will begin operations, initially with a capital of €303.5 million, derived from the transfer of EYATH S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thessaloniki) and EYDAP S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Athens) back to the state. There are also plans for new sources of funding. The new IIF will operate as a subsidiary of Growthfund, with independent governance, management, and investment decisions, and BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (“BlackRock FMA”) will be its strategic advisor. BlackRock FMA has significant experience in investment and asset management, risk management, and technology, as well as extensive knowledge in advising institutional entities on capital markets issues. Trump’s Tariff Policy Benefited Germany’s Exports Since the “day of liberation,” the world has been living in great uncertainty regarding the tariffs that President Trump would eventually impose on imported goods and services in the U.S. As expected, ahead of the potential tariff imposition, the U.S. market rushed to accelerate imports and stock up in order to benefit from the transition period. The first beneficiary of this new situation was… the German economy. Germany’s trade surplus jumped sharply to €21.1 billion in March, from €18 billion in February. This surge was driven by an increase in exports, as businesses rushed to send goods before the expected U.S. tariffs were imposed. German exports rose by 1.1% on a monthly basis, while imports fell by 1.4%. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. was the top destination for German exports, which increased by 2.4% from February, as American buyers accelerated purchases to avoid potential tariff hikes. First Bank Product for Trump’s Tariffs HSBC announced that it had developed a new loan product specifically targeted at U.S. companies struggling to cover the costs of Trump’s tariffs, which have disrupted global supply chains. HSBC is offering working capital to businesses facing pressure on their cash flows due to higher import costs and supply chain disruptions. The bank is also providing support for businesses in managing the immediate financial impacts of tariffs, while they adjust their procurement strategies and re-route their supply chains before passing on costs to consumers. The loan offers flexible repayment terms and a tailored risk assessment, recognizing the heightened uncertainty in global trade. The False Image of Market Indices – 42% of Russell 2000 Companies Are in Losses We daily read and hear about the spectacular rise of indices in Wall Street’s stock markets. However, these indices only reflect a part of the U.S. economic reality, namely the large and powerful (primarily technological) business conglomerates. For smaller-cap stocks, Wall Street is not as generous. The truth is that the new tariff regime, regardless of the final amount, will primarily hurt small-cap companies and small businesses. Futures contracts predict further declines, as investors bet on additional drops in small-cap stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs, in addition to economic slowdown and higher interest rates. Around 42% of companies in the Russell 2000 index are reporting losses, and this percentage is even higher than during the 2008 financial crisis. Explore related questions

Title: Chinese companies bought up European ports — and now Brussels is starting to worry

Chinese firms own stakes in about 30 European ports, and that’s raising security concerns. AI generated Text-to-speech Europe is getting twitchy about who owns its ports, with mounting anxiety driven by the outsized footprint of Chinese firms across the bloc’s maritime gateways. Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas on Thursday told industry leaders that Europe’s ports must “reconsider security … and examine foreign presence more carefully.” It was one of the clearest signals yet from Brussels that what once was seen as a benign investment is now starting to look like a security liability. The Commission’s recent defense white paper echoed that concern by floating the idea of stricter controls on foreign ownership of “critical transport infrastructure.” That unease is mirrored in a draft paper from the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, seen by POLITICO, which calls for tougher rules in the upcoming overhaul of the EU’s foreign investment screening regulation. Neither Tzitzikostas nor the S&D mentioned China by name, but the subtext wasn’t exactly subtle. Simon Van Hoeymissen, a researcher at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defense, said the language likely nods to Beijing’s expanding hold over key European ports — from Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam to Piraeus in Greece. Chinese giants COSCO and China Merchants, as well as Hong Kong-based Hutchison now hold stakes in more than 30 terminals across the EU. ‍“The reality is clear,” said Ana Miguel Pedro, a Portuguese MEP with the center-right European People's Party. A member of the Parliament’s Seas, Rivers, Islands & Coastal Areas Intergroup, she warned that “foreign state-driven actors like Beijing are operating with a level of coordination and intent that far exceeds the fragmented response of individual countries.” Pedro argued COSCO isn’t behaving like a typical market actor but is taking orders from the Chinese Communist Party. “Its growing presence in ports is not just an economic concern,” she said. “It’s a strategic vulnerability.” The EU is starting to see it that way, too. "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s unofficial support for Russia have only heightened concerns about the security of the EU’s ports," says a recent report from the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern Studies think tank. One example of the kind of strategic entanglement the EU is now confronting is playing out in Poland, at the Gdynia Container Terminal, where Hutchison has held a stake for over 20 years. That situation could change. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants Chinese-linked companies out of the Panama Canal, Hutchison is negotiating a $23 billion sale of port properties worldwide, including 14 in Europe, to a consortium led by BlackRock and including Mediterranean Shipping Company. However, that deal hit a wall in March after Beijing intervened. What makes Gdynia especially revealing isn’t just the trade it handles — it’s what sits next door: a naval base, a shipyard, and the headquarters of Poland’s elite naval special forces, meaning that whoever runs the terminal holds a front-row seat to European and NATO military logistics and defense operations. Recognizing the strategic significance, the Polish government has listed the terminal as critical infrastructure, meaning the operator has to work closely with the government on security. This high-stakes backdrop sharpens the edge of Pedro’s warning — and underscores why the EU is now reassessing foreign involvement in its ports with renewed urgency. “If a foreign adversary exploits a vulnerability in one European port, it jeopardizes all of us,” she said. “In today’s world, we cannot afford strategic blindness while others act with full visibility and intent.” Europe has built its war-fighting plans on speeding American reinforcements to the front lines. The prospect of that not happening is throwing military mobility plans into disarray. The project aims to make it easier to move troops and equipment between Poland and the Baltic countries.

(Getty Images: PA Images/John Walton) The British and Irish Lions squad has been announced for the upcoming tour of Australia, ending months of speculation about who would be named. England's Maro Itoje will captain the British and Irish Lions on their tour of Australia later this year, as Andy Farrell announced his touring squad. The 38-strong touring party features 15 Ireland players, 13 from England, eight from Scotland and just two from Wales. That is the lowest number of Wales players to make a Lions squad since before World War II. Of those 15 Ireland players, 12 play for Dublin-based Leinster. England's lock Maro Itoje is captain on what is his third tour with the Lions. Coach Andy Farrell, the Englishman in charge of Ireland, had some desperately tough choices to make, but has selected a very strong squad to tour Down Under. Here's the list of players rugby fans will become acquainted with over the next couple of months. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 75 caps (3 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Perth, SCO | 188cm/126kg A Glasgow Warriors stalwart, Fagerson is one of the most-reliable performers in Scotland's ever-improving side. Never one to take a backward step, the west coast product is the sort of player that you want to have in your side, which is where he will likely be if there's any possibility of things getting out of hand. However, a calf injury he suffered in the lead-up to Glasgow's URC match against Zebra did put his touring participation in doubt, with Warriors coach Franco Smith telling reporters that the issue would rule him out until late June. Leinster & Ireland | 79 caps (5 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Wexford, IRE | 183cm/119kg Tadhg Furlong is one of the premier tight head props in the world, so there was never a doubt that he would be named to his third Lions touring team. Or was there? The 32-year-old missed all but one of Ireland's underwhelming Six Nations campaign and its entire series of autumn internationals with troublesome hamstring and calf injuries, playing just 33 minutes of international rugby since July last year. Battling these re-occurring injuries has been tough and there has to be an acceptance that his body is not capable of the repeat efforts it was in his 20s. But this monster of a presence in the front row has earned his spot on tour despite the lack of game time in recent months and will likely be a pillar of strength come Test time too. Bristol Bears & England | 71 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Bristol, ENG | 187cm/116kg Ellis Genge is passion personified in an England shirt — and you'd expect the Bristolian to bring all that and more Down Under with the Lions as well. A man who walks the walk as much as he talks the talk, Genge is as mobile as they come and a hugely impressive scrummager to boot, adding yet another mark to the Lions' impressive scrum stocks on this tour — in 2022 he was named World Rugby loosehead prop of the year. Genge scored one of his rare international tries against the Wallabies in Perth in 2022, albeit in a 28-30 defeat, but will have happy memories of that tour as Eddie Jones's tourists secured a 2-1 series victory. Leinster & Ireland | 75 caps (6 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Dublin, IRE | 183cm/123kg One of the hardest-working players on the field, Leinster stalwart Andrew Porter was tireless throughout Ireland's Six Nations campaign. He hit 99 rucks — 22 more than any other prop — and made 52 tackles in the Championship — one of just two props to pass 50. Porter was named to tour with the Lions in 2021 but did not make it to South Africa after suffering a toe injury in the lead-up. He will see this as being an opportunity to make up for lost time and the missed opportunity that got away from him through no fault of his own four years ago. Edinburgh & Scotland | 42 caps (6 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Mbombela, RSA | 180cm/118kg One of Scotland's South Africa-born contingent, Schoeman has confirmed himself as one of Scotland's key performers as Gregor Townsend's boys raised themselves into the conversation. A former Springbok U20 international and ex-skipper of the Springbok schoolboys team, Schoeman made his debut for Scotland in 2021 after qualifying on residency grounds, having moved to Edinburgh in 2018. A monster at scrum time and devastating in the loose, it's easy to see why Schoeman is a fan favourite north of Hadrian's Wall and could be in with a very decent shout of wearing the number one jersey in Brisbane when the first Test comes around. Bath & England | 50 caps (3 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, London, ENG | 189cm/127kg Will Stuart had a superb Six Nations campaign for England, pushing his case with a number of assured displays. Given that the tight-head was under enormous pressure to keep his spot in the England team after a very disappointing tour of New Zealand that saw him left off the list of centrally contracted players, his resurgence has been all the more impressive. Starting at the back end of 2024, England's scrum has gone from strength-to-strength, devastating their opponents in the close confines of hand-to-hand combat that typifies the tight five. An ancient history buff who acknowledges he's happier with a lower profile than some of his front row partners, Stuart is a deserving tourist and should make his mark in the Test team. Sale Sharks & England | 49 caps (9 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 31yo, Truro, ENG | 183cm/111kg The Cornish hooker started out life in rugby as a prop before moving into the centre of the front row, where he excelled for both club and country. It's not been an easy path though, even accounting for the fact that he had former captain Jamie George to contend with for the number two jersey for England. After being one of the best hookers in the world through 2021, injury forced Cowan-Dickie to undergo neck surgery in 2023 that affected nerves in his arm for over a year. He then had a scare during a match for Sale when his heart skipped a beat … atrial fibrillation. A two-time Six Nations winner and a member of the 2019 Rugby World Cup squad that finished as runner-up, Cowan-Dickie has since given up drinking and playing Call of Duty — a game for which he was ranked as number one in the world for a short time. Leinster & Ireland | 39 caps (8 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 27yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/111kg A tourist in 2021, initially as non-travelling cover but eventually as a full-blown replacement, Kelleher's inclusion says as much about Leinster's strength in depth as it does his own abilities. Indeed, ABC Sport had Kelleher as the best-performing hooker through the first two rounds of this year's Six Nations, before Sheehan returned from injury and was judged best for the final three weeks of the campaign. When Dan Sheehan suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2024, Kelleher was a more than ample replacement for both club and country. The two twos may as well come as a package deal and will continue to share duties at all levels. Leinster & Ireland | 32 caps (15 tries) | Lions tour debut 26yo, Dublin, IRE | 191cm/111kg The most-prolific try-scoring forward in Six Nations history, Sheehan crossed the line five times in the course of the Championship this year, including a hat-trick against Italy. The Dublin lad has had his share of setbacks in his career, including an ACL injury in 2024, but never let that get him down. His return to the Leinster side saw him score two tries against the Stormers and he stepped up to captain Ireland during this year's Six Nations in the absence of Caelan Doris. A reliable lineout thrower and busier than any in the loose, Sheehan had stamped his ticket to Australia long before the squad was eventually named. Munster & Ireland | 61 caps (12 tries) | 2 Lions Test caps (2021) 33yo, Eadestown, Co Kildare, IRE | 198cm/113kg The Munster skipper made his international bow for Ireland's senior team against Australia in 2018, helping the squad to a historic 2-1 victory. In fact, in three Tests against Australia for Ireland he has never been on the losing side. The ex-Leinster and Scarlets man will be hoping for something similar when he dons the red of the British and Irish Lions. A stellar performer who can also play in the back row if required, Beirne has twice been named in the World Rugby men's team of the year in the second row. During the Six Nations, Beirne and Andrew Porter both received abuse for an incident that saw Antoine Dupont rupture his ACL, with France coach Fabien Galthie particularly passionate. However, Beirne was adamant that there was no malice and it was just an unfortunate incident at a clean-out of a ruck. Leicester Tigers & England | 28 caps (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Boston, ENG | 201cm/118kg Following an 11-month injury lay-off, Ollie Chessum was brought straight back into England's Six Nations squad, underlining the high esteem the Lincolnshire man is held by Steve Borthwick — who should know a thing or two about being an international lock. Chessum's reaction to those back-to-back injuries to his shoulder and knee impressed his Australian coach at Leicester, Michael Cheika, who praised his attitude to rehab. A giant of a man, Chessum has been a feature of England's second row but can also be used in the back row if required. Glasgow Warriors & Scoland | 42 caps (2 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, Glasgow, SCO | 198cm/116kg Capped at almost every level by Scotland, Cummins was first selected in the senior squad by Gregor Townsend in 2017 but did not make his debut in the senior team until 2019. A long wait, but worth it for the Glaswegian, who has since made himself an integral member of the Scotland side. Cummins was in the spotlight in 2024 when he was sent off against South Africa for an innocuous-looking clean-out at a ruck. His absence from the squad through a broken arm for the 2025 edition was keenly felt for a Scotland team that somewhat stalled in their development. Saracens & England | 93 caps (8 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 30yo, London, ENG | 195cm/118kg A man writing himself into the history books as one of England's all-time greats. Itoje, named skipper of England for this year's Championships, was the only man to play in every minute of every game as England managed a heartening second-place finish behind France. A man who leads by example, whose performances simply demand respect whether it's for Saracens, England, or the Lions. This will be his third Lions tour and, given he has played in every Test on the previous two tours he's been on with the Lions, expect his name to be among the first on the team sheet this time around as well and add his list to the great locks of the past, like Willie John McBride and Alun Wyn Jones. Leinster & Ireland | 93 caps (8 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Manhattan, USA | 198cm/124kg One of Ireland and Leinster's key performers in the second row over the last few years, McCarthy is a giant of a man who made his international debut against the Wallabies in 2022. He didn't have the most impactful Six Nations campaign, but has been impressive domestically for Leinster. Discipline is going to be a hot topic on tour, and one that McCarthy will need to be careful about. In a later match against the Wallabies, the New York-born, Ireland-raised lock left quite the impression on Rob Valetini in Dublin last year, when he clashed heads with the Aussie forward only to escape punishment from the officials. McCarthy was penalised with a sin-binning though for pulling back Thomas Ramos in Dublin during the Six Nations, which allowed the French to capitalise and run away with the win. It was a rare card for a team that had taken great pride in its discipline over the past few years and the sort of issue teams cannot afford to give away in tight Test matches. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland | 203cm/124kg Another monster of a lock who has been a stalwart in the Leinster and Ireland back row for a number of years. In fact, current Wallabies coach Joe Schimdt thought so highly of Ryan that he handed him his full international debut before he had suited up for Leinster, becoming the first player since 2012 to play for his country before his province. His inclusion was vindicated — he scored a try on debut. Many of the squad have leadership credentials and Ryan is no exception, captaining the Ireland under 20s to a runners-up finish at the 2016 world championship — Ireland's best-ever position. His talkative nature to referees eventually led to him being replaced, but don't expect that will stop him from muttering a few words out on the field. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (13 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 32yo, Bray, Co Wicklow, Ireland | 193cm/124kg A fixture of the Leinster team for more than a decade, Conan is an immense runner in the loose, who is also a furious presence in defence, earning the joint-highest number of turnovers of anyone in the Ireland squad throughout the Six Nations despite mostly playing off the bench. Comfortable anywhere in the back three, he scored tries against Scotland, Wales and France, as well as being a key factor in the second-half surge that accounted for England. It is off the bench where Conan can be most effective, acknowledging that during the week being a squad member in modern rugby is vital. Another player who has had to return from almost a year out of the game — in part due to missing the 2024 summer tour for the arrival of his first child — Conan suffered a shoulder injury in the Six Nations but he has since recovered. Sale Sharks & England | 61 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, London, ENG | 185cm/109kg There were very few players who performed as consistently well throughout the Six Nations as Tom Curry. Starting every game for England, his stunning work rate in both attack and defence were impossible to ignore by anyone watching. Perhaps most impressively though was the stunning display he produced in Cardiff, where he embarrassed his opposite number and Lions jersey frontrunner Jac Morgan in a devastating display, all in front of coach Andy Farrell. Don't back against him adding to his three Lions caps despite the impossible strength in depth of the back row across the British Isles. Saracens & England | 42 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 27yo, Redhill, ENG | 183cm/107kg Another of the stellar England backrow unit who simply doesn't know what fatigue is — or at least plays that way. No England player had more carries than Earl through the Six Nations, with the Saracens man taking all 63 of them into contact — second only to Blair Kinghorne in his propensity to hit tacklers. Earl also made more tackles than any other England player, no mean feat given how the entire loose forward contingent hunted in packs. He also stole five balls at the breakdown, equal most of all England players with Ben Curry, and made a turnover tackle as well. You know what you're going to get if you pick Ben Earl, a whirlwind of power and willingness. Ospreys & Wales | 24 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 25yo, Swansea, WAL | 182cm/105kg By the end of the Six Nations, Wales skipper Jac Morgan looked absolutely exhausted. That's understandable. He had played every minute of Wales's sorry campaign, making more tackles (92) than anyone else in the tournament, hitting more rucks than anyone bar Gregory Alldritt and doing it all while carrying his misfiring teammates on his back. It would not have gone unnoticed that Morgan had his worst display of the tournament in the humiliation at the hands of England in Cardiff, where he was comprehensively outplayed by his direct opponent for a Lions starting berth, Ben Curry. Wales has a fine heritage when it comes to the Lions, and although the number of tourists from Wales is paltry compared to recent years, in Morgan they have at least provided one of the best. Northampton Saints & England | 1 cap (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 20yo, Banbury, ENG | 186cm/100kg Get used to this name, because it's one you're going to be hearing a lot of in rugby circles over the next few years. Bruising and combative back row forwards are 10-a-penny in rugby union, and yet there is still something a little bit special about this youngster. Having captained England at under 18 and under 20 level — the latter of which saw him lift the 2024 under 20 Rugby World Championship — Pollock roared into senior team contention after starring for England A against Australia in London in November last year. He made his senior debut off the bench in Cardiff as England romped to a belting victory against their arch nemesis, with Pollock scoring twice. His display against Leinster in Dublin for the Saints showed that he loves the limelight, laying down tackles on his senior rivals and scoring a wonderful try that embarrassed Sam Prendergast to such an extent that it may have been the deciding moment that saw him missing the trip. Every tour needs a bolter and Pollock has proven with his stellar performances this year that he is more than up to the task. Leinster & Ireland | 73 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Wicklow, IRE | 186cm/103kg Despite the name suggesting otherwise, Josh van der Flier is not one of the South African exiles playing in Europe. In fact, he's of Dutch stock, and was born and raised in Wicklow south of Dublin. A keen thinker — he has a masters degree from Dublin Business School — van der Flier has been one of Ireland's best for a number of years, winning the World Rugby player of the year award in 2022 and being named player of the series for the 2024 November internationals. Nobody in an Ireland shirt made more tackles than him in the Six Nations, nor hit as many rucks as he did. Leinster & Ireland | 43 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 33yo, Great Barrier Island, NZ | 175cm/80kg A player who cut his teeth playing for Taranaki in the National Provincial Championships across the ditch, Jamison Gibson-Park was considered one of the rising stars of New Zealand rugby. As a 20-year-old he was selected for the Māori All Blacks in 2012, before going on to play Super Rugby for the Blues and Hurricanes. Staying in New Zealand though, was not Gibson-Park's destiny, as he would move to Dublin in 2016, becoming eligible for Ireland on residency grounds in 2019. He made his Ireland debut in 2020 and has since been awarded citizenship. A shoe-in for the number nine jersey, Gibson-Park started the Six Nations brightly against England, but frankly dropped off as the tournament progressed. The Lions will want and need him on top form if they are to succeed Down Under. Northampton Saints & England | 23 caps (4 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Maidstone, ENG | 178cm/89kg An exciting, running scrum half, Alex Mitchell was involved in five tries for England in the Six Nations, second most behind Northampton teammate Tommy Freeman. And yet it is his form for Northampton that has undoubtedly got the 27-year-old Kent man on the plane. Against Leinster last week he was exceptional, leading the Saints to an unlikely European final. With Northampton providing four tourists, expect Mitchell to use his relationship with Fin Smith on the midweek team to great effect and work to get into that Test team. Gloucester & Wales | 60 caps (10 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Treorchy, WAL | 180cm/86kg There's no hiding from Wales's abysmal Six Nations campaign, but among the ashes of a once fine rugby nation, Tomos Williams still flickered. From the former mining region of the Rhondda Fawr Valley, Williams will be upholding Welsh pride on tour alongside his country skipper Jac Morgan. Given Wales's fine history with the Lions, there's no wonder he admitted to shedding a tear when he heard he had made the squad. A darting runner who honed his speed of foot and mind on the sevens circuit, the ex-Cardiff man will relish having a pack in front of him that's not going backwards at a rate of knots when he suits up for the Lions. Bath & Scotland | 85 caps (415pts, 9 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 32yo, Stirling, SCO | 182cm/87kg Mercurial. Established. Flashy. Take your pick of adjectives to describe Finn Russell. But one thing you can be sure of is his will to win. In a Six Nations tournament filled with young pretenders for the Lions 10 shirt, Russell could be considered a safe pair of hands — although the veteran did have his moments with some careless play against Ireland and some terrible goal-kicking against England. Despite those lapses Scotland has, under his guidance, developed one of the best attacking back lines in the world, albeit one that did not quite have the cutting edge he or coach Gregor Townsend would have hoped for during the Northern Hemisphere spring. He is the top scorer in the Premiership for Bath, with 148 points (five penalties, 59 conversions and three tries), which should be an indication his ability off the tee has not been dulled. With even more weapons at his disposal and a brutally strong pack ahead of him, what could Russell do for the Lions? We may not have to wonder too long. Northampton Saints & England | 11 caps (29pts) | Lions tour debut 22yo, Warwick, ENG | 178cm/87kg Just a couple of months ago nobody would have thought Fin Smith would be anything other than deserving of a cursory mention when it came to the British and Irish Lions squad — perhaps only in passing as reference to his grandfather, Tom Elliot, the Scotland prop who played eight tour games but no Tests on the 1955 Lions tour of South Africa. Yet, after a superb Six Nations and a series of magical performances for the Saints in both the Premiership and European Cup competition, young Fin forced himself into the conversation. Having been named in the Premiership team of the season and the Players Association players' player of the year in 2023/24 should have been a clue as to the trajectory his career was on, but managing to convert that domestic form into the international stage was something else. His performances up against fellow young gun, Sam Prendergast would have made a particular impression on the selection team just last week when the youngster helped guide the Saints to a hugely unexpected victory over Leinster at the Aviva Stadium in the European Cup semifinal. Harlequins & England | 44 caps (14 tries, 314pts) | Lions tourist in 2021 26yo, Manila, PHI | 175cm/82kg One of the most thrilling broken-play players in world rugby, Marcus Smith should, perhaps, feel a little fortunate that he has been included in this Lions squad. A year ago you'd have said the Harlequins man was a nailed-on starter for both the Lions and England, but with the rise of Fin Smith and a shift to fullback at international level, Marcus's stock has fallen. And yet, despite a dramatic drop-off in club form of late, there are few players in the world who can incite as much excitement as Smith does when he has his hands on the ball. Whether he plays at 15 or 10 on tour, given the amount of ball the Lions will be expected to have, he could make hay against any opponent, with his versatility potentially making him an ideal bench player for the Test team. Connacht & Ireland | 65 caps (18 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 35yo, Ōtāhuhu, NZ | 178cm/102kg It's easy to think of Bundee Aki as another of New Zealand's rugby refugees now plying his trade in Europe, but the 35-year-old veteran is so much more than that. Moving from the Chiefs fresh after winning Super Rugby to unfashionable Connacht out on Ireland's windswept west coast, Aki made the Westerners a genuine title force and even helped them win the Pro12 in 2015. As Ireland has surged, so has Aki, winning two grand slams and three Six Nations titles in total since he made his debut in 2017, after completing his three years of residency. Aki was criticised earlier in his career after admitting that he moved to Ireland primarily to play international rugby, but has embraced life so comprehensively in Galway that he has become a citizen in 2024. "I love the people, I love the culture … There's not a bad word I can speak about Ireland," Aki said upon being made a citizen. Saracens & England | 65 caps (131 points, 18 tries) | 5 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Croydon, ENG | 178cm/83kg He's listed as a centre, but in reality Elliot Daly can play just about anywhere in the back line. Immense under the high ball and a brutal attacking force, Daly will likely slot in at fullback as often as he will in the centres. His enormous boot, capable of kicking penalty goals from beyond half way, may also prove vital. Another of the backs in this squad to be in the incredibly small group of players who have played both for and against the touring side. In 2023, Daly played for the Barbarians who took on the touring Lions in Hong Kong. Since then he has gone on to play five Tests, including all three in the dramatic drawn series against New Zealand in 2021. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Leith, SCO | 186cm/102kg Scotland to England to South Africa to Scotland and now the Lions — Huw Jones's rugby life has already taken him plenty of places around the world. Born in Scotland, Jones was educated in England before moving to South Africa, where he got his first taste of professional rugby with Western Province and then the Stormers in Super Rugby. The call of home was always there though and he moved to the Glasgow Warriors where, either side of a season at Harlequins, he has remained ever since. A hard-running and skilful ball carrier whose ability to unpick a defence with lines few can see let alone defend against, Jones has been one of the stars in a backline full of them for the Scots in recent years — particularly in partnership with former Australian Sione Tuipulotu. Although he has not played since the Six Nations on account of an ankle injury, he had plenty of credit in the bank to keep his spot in the squad. Leinster & Ireland | 67 caps (77 points, 15 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, IRE | 185cm/102kg A fleet-of-foot centre who has been a fixture in the Ireland set-up since 2016, Gary Ringrose is a multiple winner at club and international level. One of the most skilled ball-handlers in the game, Ringrose has the ability to unlock defences with a hint of a swerve as much as a powerful fend. Being sent off for a high tackle against Wales — and a subsequent three-match ban — limited his international appearances this season. But there was little concern that Andy Farrell would leave one of his most dependable backs at home. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Melbourne, AUS | 179cm/104kg The Melbourne Rebels are, sadly, no more, but they will be represented in some small way at least on this year's Lions tour. A graduate of the Rebels set-up, Sione Tuipulotu felt like his Lions dream was over after he suffered a pectoral injury in January that has kept him out of action until May. Fortunately, Andy Farrell had already seen enough from this adopted Scot, who qualified for the tartan army on account of his grandmother. And it's a fitting reward for what has been a stunning rise for the Australian-born centre, who has inarguably been the heart and soul of Scotland's rise into genuine contenders in recent years as captain. In November, Tuipulotu clashed with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, so that might be one to keep an eye on Down Under. Northampton & England | 20 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Oxford, ENG | 188cm/92kg Tommy Freeman made history during the 2025 Six Nations, becoming the first Englishman to score a try in each round of fixtures — even if the legitimacy of the try awarded against Scotland at Twickenham is justifiably contested north of the border. One of the rising stars of England rugby, Freeman combines powerful running with electric speed and finishing ability — everything you could ask for from a winger, in other words. Overall he has 16 tries from 17 starts for Northampton, and five in nine for England this season. He made his starting debut for England at Lang Park in 2022 under Eddie Jones, perhaps he'll make his Lions debut there too. Connacht & Ireland | 28 caps (12 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Canberra, AUS | 188cm/89kg Mack Hansen suffered an ankle injury that will force him to miss the last few rounds of the United Rugby Championship, which must have meant he feared for his spot on this year's Lions tour, especially given the impressive form of Scotland's Darcy Graham. He needn't have worried, despite professing to being "speechless" for the first time in his life. Despite not having the most prolific of Six Nations tournaments, the Australian-born winger with an Irish mother has been a key member of Andy Farrell's back line for Ireland and was, if not a certainty for selection, a pretty safe bet. Hansen was one of the first players interviewed after the squad was announced, telling the event at the O2 via Zoom that he had just been about to go for a swim on Ireland's west coast. In May. You can take the boy out of Australia … Leinster & Ireland | 40 caps (17 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Nelson, NZ | 188cm/101kg Not many players will have played both against the British and Irish Lions as well as for them, but that's a rare honour that James Lowe will likely achieve this tour. Lowe first played against the Lions in 2017, when he appeared at fullback for the Māori All Blacks in their 32-10 defeat against the Lions in Rotorua. That was the last of Lowe's eight caps for the Māori. Fast forward eight years and Lowe has 40 international appearances for Ireland under his belt and a reputation as one of the most dangerously powerful wingers in the world. Edinburgh & Scotland | 49 caps (32 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps 29yo, George, RSA | 193cm/106kg Nothing short of a try-scoring machine he may be, but Duhan van der Merwe does have his critics, summarised succinctly by Rugby World this week: "Some may argue that Duhan van de Merwe doesn’t offer enough ‘without’ the ball," wrote columnist and author Paul Williams. "But that’s much like criticising a nuclear weapon because all it does is blow things up." It's a fair enough statement. This monstrous winger tore up the record books as a kid in the Western Cape, earning a spot as part of the South Africa squad that finished runners-up at the 2014 Junior World Championship. A move to Montpellier in 2016 didn't really work out, but shifting north to Edinburgh proved the trick, with the club signing him despite question marks over a hip injury. Injury is clouding him in the lead-up to this Lions Tour, an ankle injury requiring surgery has kept him out the Edinburgh line up since March. Leinster & Ireland | 46 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/92kg A Paris 2024 Olympian with the Ireland Sevens team, Hugo Keenan displays all the skills needed to break lines and tackles at will in the 15s game as well. Equally capable at fullback or the wing, Keenan is super capable under the high ball and is very dangerous in broken play — kicking to him is ill-advised. Another of Leinster's bevvy of stars who will line up for the Lions — 12 of the touring squad play in the blue of Leinster. Stade Toulousain & Scotland | 60 caps (146 pts, 16 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Edinburgh, SCO | 193cm/107kg The stand out 15 of the home nations during the past Six Nations, nothing would stop Blair Kinghorn being named in this squad. That's despite him likely to miss at least the first tour match in Perth against the Force due to Toulouse's Top14 finals commitments. The final of the Top14 — of which Toulouse are runaway leaders of at the moment — takes place on the same day as the Lions' first match in Australia, June 28. But given Kinghorn's skill set — barring scrumhalf he can reasonably be expected to slot in anywhere in the back line should the need arise — there was no doubt that the ex-Edinburgh man would make the trip, no matter how delayed he is. The British and Irish Lions will play nine matches in Australia, culminating the three Tests in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney in late July/early August. Prior to their departure, the Lions will face Argentina at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. This will be the third time in recent years that the Lions have faced a national team as part of their pre-tour preparations, following matches against Japan at Murrayfield in 2021 (Lions won 28-10) and against Argentina in Cardiff in 2005 (a 25-25 draw). The Lions have also met France at the Parc des Princes in 1989 (Lions won 29-27), a Rest of the World team at Cardiff Arms Park in 1986 (Lions won 15-7) and the Barbarians at Twickenham in 1977 (Lions won 23-14). There were also unofficial matches against Cardiff and Wales at the old Arms Park in 1951 and 1955 after the tourists had returned. The tour proper though, starts in Perth. ABC Sport will be live blogging every match of the British and Irish Lions Tour, including all three Tests.

Title: Briefly Noted
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/05/briefly-noted-103/
Time Published: 2025-05-09T00:25:08Z
Full Content:
After 35 years with Ariel Investments, effective May 1, 2025, John P. Miller is retiring from his role as portfolio manager for the Ariel Fund. RiverNorth/Oaktree High Income Fund (RNHIX) won the 2025 LSEG Lipper Fund Award for Best General Bond Fund for the five-year period ended November 30, 2024. RiverNorth is a closed-end fund specialist that has collaborated with other “A” managers on several funds. The fund embodies three strategies. RiverNorth manages the Tactical Closed-End Fund Strategy, and Oaktree manages the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies. Oaktree tactically manages the allocation between the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies based on both market opportunities and the risk-reward trade-offs between the two asset classes. The fund has returned 4.2% APR since inception, while the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index clocked in at 1.6%. Lazard US Equity Concentrated Portfolio will undergo a reverse stock split, 1:3, effective May 16, 2025. BlackRock has filed for a new active infrastructure ETF, iShares Active Infrastructure ETF, which will likely launch by the end of June. The ETF, which does not yet list a ticker or fees, is to be managed by Balfie Morrison, who leads the BlackRock Global Listed Infrastructure fund, which is currently only offered in Australia. The Australian fund launched in 2007 and has, since inception, trounced its benchmark (11.5% APR vs 8.75% for a Developed Core Infrastructure 50/50 index). Mr. Morrison became co-manager of that fund in September 2023. Reportedly, the new ETF will be substantially similar to that fund. If so, expect a bit over 50% US and a bit over 50% utilities. BlackRock also offers the passive, five-star $2.2 billion iShares US Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity fund reopened to new investors effective April 1. The fund was soft closed since May 2020, when it hit its target capacity. The decision to reopen the fund is due to significant redemptions in recent years, due to the sentiment of emerging markets and underperformance. Effective May 1, 2025, the expense ratio for Janus Henderson Corporate Bond ETF has dropped to 0.20% for at least 12 months. BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund will be converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF and the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, respectively, on Sept. 12. The expense ratios will be 0.4%, and both funds will retain their current objectives and managers and maintain “substantially similar” strategies. GQG US Equity ETF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund in registration. Under normal circumstances, the ETF will invest in U.S companies. Rajiv Jain, Brian Kersmanc, and Sudarshan Murthy are the portfolio managers; Siddharth Jain is the Deputy Portfolio Manager. Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Reductions and/or Expense Reimbursements will be 0.49%. On or about May 9, 2025, Lazard International Equity Advantage Portfolio will convert to an ETF, the Lazard International Dynamic Equity ETF. On or about November 7, 2025, Morgan Stanley Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund will be rechristened as Morgan Stanley Income Opportunities Fund and relaunched as an active ETF. Pending shareholder approval in June, the Morgan Stanley Mortgage Securities Trust will relaunch as the Eaton Vance Mortgage Opportunities ETF. On June 20, 2025, the OTG Latin America Fund will become the OTG Latin America ETF. On April 3, Vanguard Short Duration Bond ETF, an actively managed exchange-traded fund, launched. It offers diversified exposure to primarily short-duration U.S. investment-grade bonds, including structured products exposure, like asset-backed securities, with the flexibility to invest in below investment-grade debt to seek additional yield. The fund has an expense ratio of 15 bps. Vanguard Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF, Vanguard Total Treasury ETF, and Vanguard Government Securities Active ETF are in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager of the inflation-protected securities and total treasury ETFs. John Madziyire, CFA, Nathan Persons, and Brian W. Quigley, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of the government securities active ETF. The Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF will have total annual expenses of .05%; the Total Treasury ETF will have total annual expenses of .03%; and the Government Securities Active ETF will have total annual expenses of .10%. Virtus IG Public & Private Credit ETF is in registration. David Albrycht, CFA; Zachary Szyndlar, CFA; Ryan Jungk, CFA; George Goudelias; and John Wu, CFA will manage the fund. The plan is to provide diversification by allocating the fund’s investments among various sectors of these markets, including, without limitation: investment grade corporate bonds; mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), including commercial MBS and residential MBS; asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including private credit. Expenses have not been stated. Effective on or about November 21, 2025, the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF becomes the iShares U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness Aware Active ETF. “Readiness Aware.” Your guess is as good as ours. Effective May 2, 2025, the Calamos Alternative Nasdaq® & Bond ETF will become the Calamos Nasdaq® Equity & Income ETF. Carillon Chartwell Small Cap fund will be reorganized into the Chartwell Small Cap Growth fund on or about October 17. The following name changes will take effect on June 2, 2025: My first impulse was: “more babble.” Maybe not. Here’s their explanation. The iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF’s Underlying Index is an optimized index designed to maximize exposure to positive ESG characteristics while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index. In addition to its name change, effective with the rebalance at the end of May 2025, the Index Provider for iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF has updated the index methodology to require that the Underlying Index have a minimum ESG score of at least 20% better than that of the MSCI USA Index … On June 25, 2025, Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund will be (new word for me) “repositioned” as the ESG-lite Janus Henderson International Dividend Fund. At base, they will loosen ESG strictures on the portfolio while not entirely abandoning “consideration” of ESG factors that are “financially material.” The advisor to ONEFUND, an S&P 500 index fund? Effective immediately, the adviser’s name has changed from ONEFUND, LLC to CYBER HORNET ETFS. Presumably from Michael Saylor’s feverish, “Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.” And presumably, they’re staking their future on their second fund, the CYBER HORNET S&P500 Bitcoin 75/25 Strategy ETF. Effective May 1, 2025, Roundhill Small Cap 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF will be renamed Roundhill Russell 2000 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF. The Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund has been renamed the Schwab Prime Advantage Money Fund. All other aspects of the fund remain the same. (Thanks, Don G.!) Effective April 4, 2025, the WisdomTree PutWrite Strategy Fund (PUTW) changed its name (now, the WisdomTree Equity Premium Income Fund), principal investment strategies, and ticker symbol. On June 26, 2025, (a) Chip and I will be in Sweden, and (b) the WisdomTree Japan Hedged SmallCap Equity Fund will become the WisdomTree Japan Opportunities Fund. But wait! There’s more. It’s going to be an index fund with a very distinctive index. Among the new fund’s other quirks are the following allocation bands: 0-45% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that are strategic holdings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that provide a high “total shareholder yield” 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that have a low valuation ratio but favorable earnings and dividend growth characteristics. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of companies that have exposures to thematic opportunities from developments in the geopolitical space, technology trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Within this latter category, 25-50% of the stocks will be companies positioned “to benefit from geopolitical considerations,” 5-25% from central bank movements, and 5-25% from cool new tech. The Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF and Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF were closed and liquidated on April 29, 2025. On April 25, 2025, Foundry Partners Small Cap Value Fund merged with North Square Small Cap Value Fund. On May 9, 2025, the Gotham Enhanced 500 Plus Fund and Gotham Hedged Core Fund merged with and into the Gotham Index Plus Fund. Effective April 11, 2025, the Hartford Schroders Sustainable International Core Fund was liquidated. On April 17, 2025, the Mast Global Battery Recycling & Production ETF was shut down. The Neuberger Berman International Small Cap Fund will experience termination and liquidation on or about May 28, 2025. (sigh. That means it will miss my birthday party again this year.) On April 29, 2025, the Ramirez Government Money Market Fund was liquidated. On May 16, 2025, the Range Global LNG Ecosystem Index ETF will be liquidated. Sprucegrove International Equity Fund was liquidated on May 1, 2025. On or about May 30, 2025, the Tuttle Capital Self Defense Index ETF (not the silliest of the advisor’s offerings, IMHO) will be liquidated, terminated, and otherwise struck defenseless. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: BlackRock-Backed Securitize Raises Strategic Funding From Jump Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/05/08/blackrock-backed-securitize-raises-strategic-funding-from-jump-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T15:30:58Z
Full Content:
ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of Securitize Jump Crypto, the digital asset arm of Chicago quantitative trading firm Jump Trading, has taken a strategic stake in Miami-based Securitize, one of the leading platforms bringing real-world assets (RWAs) like Treasurys and private credit onto public blockchains. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This is the first outside investment in Securitize since BlackRock’s $47 million round last year, which cemented the firm as a cornerstone of the fast-growing tokenization market. Other blue-chip asset managers, including Apollo, Hamilton Lane and KKR, have also tapped Securitize to issue blockchain-based funds. These aren’t fringe crypto experiments. The funds tokenize mainstream products including Treasurys, private credit, and private equity on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the $10 trillion asset manager’s first blockchain-based vehicle, which also is Securitize’s marquee product, has become something of a bellwether of tokenization. Structured as a money market fund, it now manages $2.86 billion in assets. Since its debut just a little over a year ago, tokenized Treasury products have surged 800% to nearly $7 billion, a sign that the pitch is resonating with yield-hungry investors looking for alternatives to traditional wrappers. Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize “We think that the market should be digesting this investment really as a signal that firms like Jump now have conviction in not only tokenization, but the role and the impact that tokenization is having on capital markets, capital formation and investment accessibility on chain,” says Michael Sonneshein, Securitize's COO and former CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale. He argues that tokenization offers distinct advantages that legacy formats don’t match. Products like BUIDL, for instance, pay daily dividends, something traditional money market funds do not, and investors are increasingly choosing tokenized Treasurys over stablecoins as collateral, largely because tokenized products share yield with holders. In addition, pairing tokenized funds with decentralized finance opens new lending opportunities. Jump will help Securitize to do just that: expand the role of tokenized assets in collateral management and trading. The tokenization sector is growing fast. Since BUIDL’s launch, RWAs have more than doubled from about $9 billion in total value locked to $22.4 billion. Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market will balloon to $19 trillion by 2033. On Monday, the SEC's Crypto Task Force will host a roundtable on tokenization with issuers including Securitize. Meanwhile, the company is preparing its next act. In partnership with Lisbon-based Ethena Labs, it is about to launch a new blockchain called Converge. The idea is to create a compliant gateway for institutional capital into DeFi. Converge is expected to launch later this quarter.

Title: US and Russia seek ways to restore gas flows to Europe
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/05/08/us-and-russia-seek-ways-to-restore-gas-flows-to-europe/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T14:47:30Z
Full Content:
Officials from Washington and Moscow held discussions on the U.S. contribution to reviving Russian natural gas sales to Europe, eight sources familiar with the content of the talks told Reuters. Sources close to the bilateral talks said that carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union’s gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although much of Europe has sought alternative supplies, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is in place. As for Russia, nothing has hurt its economy more than the loss of most of the European gas market three years ago. Today Russia supplies 19% of Europe’s demand, up from 40%, consisting mostly of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some of it piped through Turkey via the TurkStream pipeline. Washington’s involvement in restoring gas sales could help Moscow overcome political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington by offering it the ability to see and possibly control to some extent the volumes of Russian gas that return to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said. From 2022, Europe has turned to other gas suppliers, including U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). U.S. envoy Steve Whitcoff and Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, have discussed gas as part of the Ukraine peace talks, two of the eight sources said. Whitkov’s spokesman declined to comment when asked if they had discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. “At present, there are no such discussions,” Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which Dmitriev heads, said in a statement to Reuters. As for how the Americans could get involved, five sources said that in talks so far there has been talk of U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline linking Russia to Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself. U.S. companies could also serve as buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and sending it to Europe, including Germany, the sources said. Two of the sources said diplomatic talks involving potential U.S. investors also considered the idea of a U.S. buyer taking Russian gas and then exporting it to Europe as a way to mitigate European political opposition to resuming supplies. BlackRock, Vanguard and Capital Group each own 1-2% of Gazprom. BlackRock, Vanguard and Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment. Capital Group declined to comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed opposition to a return to Russian energy supplies. “Some people still say we need to turn on the tap of Russian gas and oil again. This would be a mistake of historic proportions and we will never let it happen,” she told a European Parliament meeting on May 7. “Russia has proven, time and again, that it is not a reliable supplier.” Brussels wants to ban new Russian gas deals by the end of 2025 and ban imports under existing deals by the end of 2027. The plan, which will be debated next month, will require the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of member states. Hungary and Slovakia have expressed their opposition to the move. Trump has said he hopes for a peace deal on Ukraine soon and expects this will pave the way for both Russia and Ukraine to do major business with the U.S. Russia is ready to restart gas exports to Europe immediately if there is political will to do so, Putin said. Kiev and Washington signed a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal on April 30 that would include all natural resource assets and infrastructure owned by the Ukrainian government, but did not explicitly mention the pipeline. “If this level of engagement between Russia and the US continues, it is very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows… involving US intermediaries,” a person familiar with the discussions said. Gazprom, keen to revive its European sales, is considering offering German customers short-term 24-month contracts and big discounts on prices, two sources said. It has traditionally asked buyers to sign decades-old contracts, the two sources noted. However, the EU remains broadly opposed and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases pending regarding violations of old contracts.
