Title: Expect a ‘huge sucking sound’ of foreign capital flooding in as U.S. dominance of global finance increases, top economist says

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street has been flying high as an expected Republican sweep in the election drives hopes for lower taxes and deregulation, and that makes U.S. financial markets more attractive to the rest of the world, a top economist said. In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian was asked if investors should expect a positive growth shock that's accompanied by more inflation. "The direction of travel is clear: More growth, slightly higher inflation, a higher public sector borrowing requirement, and a huge sucking sound where a lot of foreign capital will end up in the U.S.," he replied. The magnitudes of those trends will become more apparent when policies from the incoming Trump administration become clearer—and when the people who will carry them out become known, El-Erian added. Just days after the presidential election, talk of potential Cabinet appointments is already ramping up. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Robert Lighthizer, who was U.S. Trade Representative during Trump's first term, was asked to fill the post again. Meanwhile, the job of Treasury secretary will likely be offered to a financier, the FT added, with hedge fund managers Scott Bessent and John Paulson seen as possibilities. Meanwhile, the rest of the world may have more trouble coping with a period of faster growth and hotter inflation, adding to America's relative edge, El-Erian said. "This is a period in which U.S. dominance of the global system is going to increase, both for positive reasons and for negative reasons in the short term," he explained. "The rest of the world simply cannot build enough pipes around the U.S. They're trying and they've been doing it, but these pipes are very small compared to the size of the U.S." Indeed, despite fears that Trump's tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration crackdown will be inflationary and worsen deficits, bonds yields have come back down after soaring in the immediate aftermath of the election. El-Erian argued that's because U.S. bonds have become more attractive relative to those from other advanced economies. Continued demand for Treasuries would help the federal government finance what's expected to be an explosion of debt under another Trump presidency. Ahead of the election, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that his policies could add $7.5 trillion to the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. But if investors, especially "bond vigilantes," balk at the enormous volumes of debt the Treasury Department auctions, they could send yields higher and raise borrowing costs across key segments of the economy, like mortgage rates. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Tuesday, however, BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink said faster economic growth would help make U.S. debt more manageable. "If GDP rises at an average of 3% in real terms over the next five years, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio would stay roughly stable at a high, but reasonable, level," he wrote.

Title: 3 Reasons Why A Crypto Dollar Will Come Sooner Than Expected
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/09/3-reasons-why-a-crypto-dollar-will-come-sooner-than-expected/
Time Published: 2024-11-09T19:54:38Z
Full Content:
A crypto dollar is not as far-fetched as it might sound As the ramifications of the recent U.S. Presidential election are analyzed by financial markets and crypto investors, one underlying fact might take some crypto investors, policy advocates, and entrepreneurs by surprise. Despite, or perhaps because of, the increased interest and investment that the crypto economy and sector had received during the recent election cycle – powered in no small part by the nearly $200 million spent by crypto lobbyists – the trends toward wider adoption and utilization continue to accelerate. Such a statement might bring to mind examples such as spot ETF products, stablecoin issuers obtaining larger shares of the payment space, or even the launch of stablecoins by TradFi institutions. The above facts and trends are correct, and have driven broader and deeper integration of cryptoassets throughout the economy, but one other institution has recently published comprehensive research on the implications, opportunities, and challenges of stablecoin adoption. The October 2024 report by the U.S. Treasury to Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee - over 100 pages of quantitative analytics and tables regarding borrowing and other Treasury activities – could have reasonably been overlooked in the recent deluge of media information and discourse. That said, in that report there are over 20 pages of graphics and data analyzing the status of stablecoins, use how these stablecoins are using and connected to the U.S. Treasury market, and the benefits of tokenized Treasury activities. Put simply, these data points paint a road map for how and why the U.S. Treasury could quickly and comprehensively become a major user of tokenized payments and stablecoins; let’s take a look at a few of them. One of the more interesting data points presented in this report is that the continued growth and proliferation of stablecoins has also led to a increase in the demand for short-dated Treasuries. Citing the analytics of Tether (issuer of USDT) $68.3% of total collateral held by the organization was in the form of U.S. Treasury Bills. In addition to the direct purchase of Treasuring by stablecoin issuers to serve as collateral for the tokens themselves, the report also puts forward another way in which stablecoins are increasing the demand for Treasuries. When compared to the larger cryptoassets and products that provide exposure to bitcoin (such as spot ETFs), stablecoins are viewed as lower risk, which can funnel investor dollars into these instruments during periods of market volatility. Additionally, as the digital asset sector grows, Treasuries may serve a role as an indirect hedge against inflation and – ultimately – a low volatility on-chain alternative to stablecoins. As the dollar faces increasing competition for its role as global reserve currency, and foreign buyers of debt may reallocate funds in future, stablecoins may grow into an alternative buyer in the future. Another fact that might surprise some crypto investors is that, even after years of an ambiguous regulatory environment and antagonistic regulations, tokenized Treasuries already exist, albeit at a modest level of approximately $2 billion. For example, tokenized treasury funds are already available to investors via funds such as Blackrock’s BUIDL Fund and Franklin Templeton’s On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to these projects, including the one via Blackrock (also the leading player in the spot bitcoin ETF space) other options include Ondo Financial, Hashnote, and CoinShares. On top of these projects, Onyx at JP Morgan leverages tokenized Treasuries to provide intraday Treasury-backed repo solutions, with the Treasury also noting that smart contracts allow simplification and automation of Treasury transactions. In other words the U.S. Treasury, while contending with other U.S. regulators and policymakers that have pursued an antagonistic approach, is well aware of the benefits of tokenized Treasuries as well as the reality that multiple projects leveraging these benefits already exist. Improvements to current clearing and settlement processes, more efficient collateral management, and better transparency via tokenized records are all duly noted as benefits for increased tokenization of the U.S. Treasury market. Much has been written about the potential for a strategic bitcoin reserve, with the discussion around this idea only increasing with the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. As exciting and arguably important as such a plan and strategic initiative is, it is only a partial solution to the problems and challenges facing the U.S. dollar and broader U.S. competitive interests. In order to remain competitive on a global basis, attract the talent necessary to succeed and lead the various industries of the future (including blockchain and tokenized transactions) the U.S. policy apparatus will need to embrace a multi-pronged approach to tokenization. A strategic bitcoin reserve is an excellent first step toward more comprehensive integration of tokenized transactions, but leveraging tokenization and blockchain transactions to improve the expand U.S. Treasury markets is an essential component of any U.S. oriented crypto plan. Crypto dollars are virtually guaranteed, and might reach mainstream adoption sooner than many crypto investors expect. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Joe Biden's Illegal Migrant Inflow to Hit 9 Million by January
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/11/09/joe-bidens-illegal-migrant-inflow-hit-nine-million-january/
Time Published: 2024-11-09T17:05:12Z
Full Content:
President Joe Biden’s border deputies will have admitted roughly nine million inadmissible migrants at the southern border by President Trump’s Inauguration Day, according to data quietly released just before the November 5 election. The agency data shows that Biden’s pro-migration chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, registered 10.5 million illegal migrants at the border from January 2021 to June 2024. Out of that total, he blocked only 2.5 million migrants under the Title 42 epidemic rules, which he lifted in mid-2023. He also “returned” home or “removed” just 1.9 million of the 10.5 million migrants. He then released almost 5.9 million migrants into the United States to take Americans’ housing, jobs, and school slots, the federal data states. Yearly repatriations by fiscal year The Cuban-born, pro-migration border chief also stood by as roughly 2.2 million additional “gotaway” migrants sneaked past the border wall. He refused to complete or sufficiently patrol the incomplete wall. From July to October, an additional 600,000 migrants arrived, and roughly 400,000 were allowed through the border. From early November to Trump’s Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, Mayorkas will have admitted another 300,000 migrants at current rates, with very little resistance from Biden’s deputies. That final flood will bring his inflow to almost nine million inadmissible southern migrants. But Mayorkas’s southern inflow was in addition to the massive legal inflow of roughly three million legal migrants. Biden also welcomed at least 1.5 million Indian and Chinese white-collar visa workers during Biden’s four years. The visa workers shrink Americans’ white-collar salaries, displace Americans from Fortune 500 careers and management, and allow C-Suite executives to disregard professionals‘ expertise in product innovation, service quality, technological security, and business reliability. So Mayorkas’s flood of roughly 15 million illegal, quasi-legal, legal, and temporary migrants adds up to roughly one new migrant for every American birth. His migrant wave was a massive giveaway to investors, who gained roughly $20 in the stock market for every $1 in profit from the resulting lower wages, additional purchases, and higher rents. The profits help to fund an Astroturf Empire of advocacy groups that keep editors from following the money in migration. But his tsunami also washed away Americans’ wages and salaries before they voted in the November election. “Revised labor productivity and cost data now show real (inflation-adjusted) compensation fell 0.2% last year,” a November 7 tweet from economist E.J. Antoni said. “Since ’20, real hourly compensation is down a cumulative 4.2% through ’23 – it’s no wonder why people are mad,” he added: The Biden administration built its economic strategy on Mayorkas’s migrants. For example, the migrants filled many new jobs at lower wages, helping to reduce some forms of inflation as Congress spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Biden’s Bidennomics priorities. However, the flood of migrants also inflated housing costs, leaving huge numbers of younger Americans poorer in 2023 than in 2019. For example, the Cato Institute admitted that Biden’s migrants into Springfield, Ohio, inflated the cost of housing by roughly $75,000 per house. Unsurprisingly, Trump gained a record share of votes in Springfield. Mayorkas’s flood of cheap labor also minimized the incentive for CEOs to raise the productivity of their blue-collar workers. When labor is in short supply, CEOs invest in workplace productivity to help their workers get more done each day. The technology includes “pick and place” robots, automated metal-cutting, and dairy robots, and it allows higher wages, community prosperity, and happy voters. But when labor is plentiful, CEOs can boost short-term profits by cutting investment in favor of hiring disposable, low-wage workers. The Biden-era damage to U.S. productivity has been ignored by the establishment media, but it was marked on November 7, when federal data show that labor productivity grew by less than one percent — or just 0.7 percent per year during Biden’s four years in office. Before Biden’s Extraction Migration strategy, productivity grew at 2.9 percent per year from 1994 to 2004 as U.S. companies began using desktop computers in a wide variety of jobs: Productivity actually fell in 2022 as the desperate and cheap migrant labor flooded into jobs once held by experienced and better-paid American employees. They also flooded into the jobs that could have employed the several million Americans who have fallen out of the workforce as too old, unhealthy, or alienated for busy employers to hire and train. The economic trauma of Biden’s wealth-shifting migration deeply damaged Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign and public support for the 1950s’ “Nation of Immigrants” narrative. It also put Trump and his allies back in power: Once Mayorkas is removed from office and his policies are reversed, the simultaneous rise in wages and loss of migrants will force companies to buy the productivity machinery being developed and built by Americans. For example, Grist.org reported on October 8: Detasseling corn used to be a rite of passage in the Midwest. Teenagers would wade through seas of corn, removing tassels — the bit that looks like a yellow feather duster at the top of each stalk — to prevent unwanted pollination. Extreme heat, drought, and intense rainfall have made this labor-intensive task even harder. And it’s now more often done by migrant farmworkers who sometimes put in 20-hour days to keep up. That’s why Jason Cope, co-founder of farm tech company PowerPollen, thinks it’s essential to mechanize arduous tasks like detasseling. His team created a tool a tractor can use to collect the pollen from male plants without having to remove the tassel. It can then be saved for future crops. “We can account for climate change by timing pollen perfectly as it’s delivered,” he said. “And it takes a lot of that labor that’s hard to come by out of the equation.” “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued [emphasis added]: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. When Mayorkas is gone, he will also have left a massive political bomb under the Democrats’ foundational claim to be the noble champions of underdogs, refugees, migrant children, and separated families. Mayorkas’s colonialism-adjacent economic strategy of Extraction Migration has expanded child labor in the United States, traded remittances to dictatorships in exchange for millions of workers, and accelerated the Mexican corruption that helps the cartels smuggle deadly drugs into American communities. His policy drained vital young workers from developing countries for use by Wall Street investors, separated millions of adult migrants from their left-behind wives and children, and helped kill many thousands of migrants in distant jungles, boats, snowstorms, and rivers. “There were two images of his treacherous journey north that he couldn’t get out of his head,” reporter Albinson Linares from Telemundo.com said in 2023 about a Venezuelan migrant named Johan Torres: The first was how a [migrant] person who resisted a robbery in Mexico was killed with a machete; the other happened in the [Panama] jungle, when he saw a man leave behind his young daughter, waist-deep in mud. “He left her there, lying in the mud and crying, and I couldn’t do anything because I was dying of exhaustion. But I can’t forget that,” he said with tears in his eyes. “Failure has many fathers, but Mayorkas is the first among equals,” Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News.

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched less than a year ago and have already been dubbed the most successful ETF launches in history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), just smashed another record. To be more precise, IBIT has now overtaken the asset manager’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of assets under management — a huge milestone given that the former investment vehicle only started trading in mid-January this year. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds more assets than the Wall Street behemoth’s gold ETF despite only launching 10 months ago. The iShares Gold ETF debuted in January 2005 and has since accumulated 32.96 billion in net assets. For comparison, the IBIT has amassed an impressive $33.17 billion in assets — a milestone the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, called “absolutely wild.” Bitcoin and gold are often considered comparable safe-haven assets, with most crypto industry pundits long treating BTC as “digital gold.” BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s bullish strength was arguably boosted by Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. During his campaign, Trump loudly supported the crypto sector. The company’s Bitcoin fund registered its highest-ever trading volume of $4.1 billion on the day Trump won the presidency. As ZyCrypto covered, the trading activity even surpassed the daily volume posted by blue chip stocks like Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, and Visa during the same timeframe — a sign of excitement among investors that the president-elect will keep all his many promises to nurture the crypto industry, replace unpopular regulators and allow crypto entrepreneurs to introduce products without fear of lawsuits or Wells Notices from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Data from Farside reveals that IBIT has clocked more than $27 billion in net inflows since its debut, with a record-breaking $1.1 billion in new investor money flowing into the ETF on Thursday, an extraordinary demonstration of demand for the spot BTC product. Meanwhile, commentators believe Trump’s victory will open the door for over a half dozen proposed cryptocurrency ETFs waiting on approval from U.S. regulators. After the Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals, asset managers have submitted a slew of regulatory filings to list ETFs holding altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Litecoin (LTC).

Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo by Steve Humphreys The funeral details for broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, have been announced following her death on Thursday at the age of 90. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. Ms Watkins’ funeral service will depart from Howth at 11am on Tuesday, arriving for Requiem Mass at 12pm at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, followed by a private burial. Her funeral notice said she died “peacefully on in the wonderful care of the team at the Blackrock Clinic”. "Beloved wife and best friend of the late Gay Byrne, loving mother to Crona and Suzy, adored Nana Kit to Cian, Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry, mother-in-law to Philip and Ronan and sister of Clare, Phil and the late Jim. Sadly missed by her family, relatives and a wide circle of treasured friends,” the notice read. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio last week that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. Tributes poured in for Ms Watkins from across the world of politics, media and beyond following the news of her death. President Michael D Higgins said it was with “great sorrow” that he and his wife Sabina learned of her passing. "We were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day’s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency. He pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks Cramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said: “I want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who’s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they’re beneath notice or they’re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.” He also raised an important question for the viewers: “If you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?” According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don’t get enough attention. “In the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103 Cramer called Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) a great bargain and remarked that it will not take a hit in the coming days. “Netflix is one of the world's greatest bargains, and because they make programming for all sides of the aisle, you know that it's not gonna get hammered by whoever comes out ahead tonight or this week or next month, whatever. There's no percentage in going after Netflix.” Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading provider of entertainment services, offering a vast variety of streaming content to millions of subscribers around the world. In October, the company reported its financial results for the third quarter, showing a 15% increase in revenue compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was accompanied by the addition of over 5 million new subscribers. Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) Chief Financial Officer, highlighted that there are still "hundreds of millions of households that aren't members," suggesting significant untapped potential for future growth. A key factor driving this expansion has been its advertising-supported subscription tier. Management indicated that the membership for the ad-supported plan grew by 35% year-over-year in the third quarter, though there were some challenges. The company is projecting total revenue for the full year 2024 to exceed $38 billion. Its management also provided guidance for 2025, anticipating revenue to reach between $43 billion and $44 billion, which would represent an approximately 11% year-over-year increase. Overall NFLX ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Cava (CAVA) might move higher on growing optimism about its earnings prospects, which is reflected by its upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While there are strong investment cases for each of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, I see one as the clear winner for long-term investors. Billionaire Bill Ackman said on Friday he would seek to delist investment firm Pershing Square Holdings and move record label Universal Music Group away from Amsterdam, following attacks on Israeli soccer fans. In a statement on X, Ackman said Pershing Square's board had already been considering the move and "events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point" to follow through. In the attacks, supporters of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv were targeted after a match, by what Amsterdam's mayor described as "antisemitic hit and run squads". Lantronix (LTRX) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -33.33% and 7.22%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 2024. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. This number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report. The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

On November 6, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered the price target on the stock to $15 from $32.50 and kept a Negative rating on the shares. The advisory updated estimates based on the preliminary results and the guide. In an investor note, the advisory noted that despite a lack of a detailed financial statement and inability to file with the SEC, the updated estimates should still help investors with margin trends, the company's earnings direction, and the implied downside risk to consensus. Overall SMCI ranks 9th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT sets record $1.1 billion in daily inflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrocks-ibit-sets-record-1-1-billion-in-daily-inflow/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T23:05:39Z

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) set a new record for inflows, reaching $1.12 billion, topping its previous record of $872 million. The new record was noted on SoSoValue and comes when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $76,677 across major exchanges on November 7. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin broke a new all-time high of $75,317 as voting results signalled a Donald Trump win for the White House. BlackRock’s IBIT net assets now account for $34.29 billion, significantly pushing it ahead of its competitors. In October, BlackRock set a new record when its total assets reached $30 billion in 293 days. Dary McGovern, COO of Bitcoin native Xapo Bank, said to CoinJournal that Bitcoin’s new record suggests a “broader shift in institutional confidence, with notable market movements such as BlackRock’s record net inflows into its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT),” adding: “The growing institutional interest underscores Bitcoin’s increasing recognition as a trusted asset class, driven by rising global demand and mainstream adoption. As more investors seek exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation becomes ever clearer.” The 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily total net inflow of $1.38 billion, also a new record since listing in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted BlackRock’s new record in a post on X, saying: “Even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any BTC ETF ever.” Told y’all it was prob gonna be big, altho even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any btc etf ever. https://t.co/Q5MPDMrTYv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 Balchunas later added that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have taken in a combined $6.7 billion in the past month and $25.5 billion year to date, and are 93% of the way to passing Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million Bitcoin. HOOVER CITY: Bitcoin ETFs took in a record-smashing $1.4b yesterday (the Trump effect). $IBIT alone was +$1.1b. That's +$6.7b in past mo and $25.5b YTD. All told they feasted on about 18k btc in one day (vs 450 mined) and are now 93% of the way to passing Satoshi's 1.1mil btc. pic.twitter.com/dNLoENlDB3 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 “This confidence suggests that Bitcoin is now seen as a legitimate hedge and growth asset, particularly appealing amid traditional market uncertainties and as regulatory clarity improves,” said James Toledano, COO at Unity, a self-custody crypto wallet, to CoinJournal. “Just look at pension funds in both the UK and US investing in Bitcoin too. Sentiment has changed massively in such a short space of time.” Grayscale’s GBTC, the second-largest by net assets at $16.80 billion, saw a net inflow of $7.31 million. Fidelity’s FBTC reported $190.92 million and Ark and 21Shares saw $17.61 million.

November 08, 2024 17:34 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) TORONTO, Nov. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) today announced that it has called a special meeting of unitholders (the “Meeting”) of the iShares Premium Money Market ETF (the “iShares Fund”), to be held on or about January 22, 2025 to approve a change to the investment objective of the iShares Fund to permit investments in asset-backed commercial paper (the “Proposal”). BlackRock Canada is holding the Meeting solely as a virtual (online) meeting by way of live audio webcast. The proposed change to the iShares Fund investment objective is as follows: Following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate in June 2024, the bankers’ acceptance (“BA”) based lending model has largely been discontinued in Canada. The discontinuation of BAs has materially reduced the iShares Fund’s access to credit exposure, which is an important source of yield. BlackRock Canada believes that Canadian dollar denominated asset-backed commercial paper is an appropriate investment opportunity for the iShares Fund in order to continue accessing investment-grade, short-term Canadian dollar credit instruments. Credit exposure is an important tool for maximizing income while maintaining liquidity. The asset-backed commercial paper market in Canada is limited to bank-sponsored issuers and has undergone significant reform since the 2007/2008 financial crisis, resulting in enhanced investor protections. The market has continued to grow in response to the discontinuation of BAs and bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper is one of the primary instruments used by Canadian money market funds to obtain credit exposure. In accordance with applicable securities laws, a joint management information circular relating to the Proposal (the “Circular”) will be made available to unitholders in advance of the Meeting. Notice of the Meeting and information outlining the procedures for accessing the Circular online (or requesting a copy thereof) will be mailed on or about December 20, 2024. Unitholders of record of the iShares Fund at the close of business on December 5, 2024, will be entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting. The Circular will also be made available on www.sedarplus.ca and www.blackrock.com/ca and will include additional details regarding the Proposal. BlackRock Canada believes that the proposed investment objective change is in the best interests of the iShares Fund. If the change to the investment objective is approved by unitholders of the iShares Fund, BlackRock Canada expects that the Proposal will be effective as of January 31, 2025. Implementation of the Proposal is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of just over $77,000 on Friday, continuing its record-breaking streak following Donald Trump’s reelection as President of the United States. The strong support from the crypto community for Trump’s return to the White House is fueling Bitcoin’s upward momentum, making its rise appear unstoppable as of now. The leading cryptocurrency hit a record high of $77,239 at approximately 3:00 PM on Friday. According to crypto tracking website CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency has surged 113,011% since 2013. This means a $1000 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1 million. Bitcoin’s price is expected to rise further, showing heightened optimism and enthusiasm among investors due to recent political developments. The momentum shows no signs of slowing — among seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Some even anticipate when the top cryptocurrency will cross the $100,000 level. Following Trump’s reelection, investors are pouring funds into the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds). On November 7th alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK+0.27%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with over $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time high has lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across various digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, hovered around $2,900, while Cardano reached $0.44—marking an impressive 10% increase in the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Chainlink and Polygon, also surged by over 7% and 13%, respectively. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The "Badlans was slightly better, but still changed like a commercial with game-play... And no song... "Whizbang" have the same "commercial type" (&level) cinematic......The latest "The Great Dark Beyond"... (inhale, exhale, inhale...) Like even Warcraft Rumble had cool cinematic - no song, but at least cinematic as it's own had "magic" & "creative" feeling - but this, the latest, was just awful, pushing even there these "influencers"(?), making it cringe like "Warcraft Rumble developer overview clip"... Warcraft Rumble cinematic >>> Warcraft Rumble developer overview. Easy.... Wronchi's videos feels like he's on some kind of "leash" - his "own" videos are much better that those which he now makes for Blizz)...... People were mad at Activision, but seems like Microsoft sending finish arrow... To the knee... And creativity level at this point seems like dead in Blizzard. People left, or were forced out - I don't know... Well - for me they have only one chance to redeem themselves, or at least give me some hope - if they will release for this upcoming anniversary "Full versions" of past cinematic songs (you know - typical stanza, refrain, stanza. But at least well finished). If they won't, I'll assume, that they will focus on pushing more skins for cards, heroes, boards, coins... And more influencers(?)... And probably this will be "the begging of the end" of this game for me... Maybe on the 50th Anniversary we'll get 3 packs? what a treat .. Guess they are running out of packs! Very "thrifty" on their rewards... 30 years boiled down to 2 packs, lol And the recent expansion release granted something like 6 packs from twitch drops lol? This is definitely a head scratcher. I think the reason is that you only need to watch for 20 minutes for these drops, whereas for the recent expansion’s drops, you had to watch for 2 hours to receive two expansion packs. bruw ... for 30 years of franchise those reawrds are very poor, especially for HS...

Title: Ethereum price prediction – Will rising leverage drive or weaken ETH’s rally?

In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion. Ethereum [ETH] has gained by 20% in just two days, with the price oscillating between $2,400 and $2,950. At press time, ETH traded at $2,922, its highest level in over three months. The recent gains have been accompanied by rising volatility. In fact, the estimated leverage ratio has spiked significantly this week to a seven-day high. At press time, this metric stood at 0.42. This shows that 42% of the open positions on the derivatives market are backed by leverage. A build-up of leverage activity tends to heighten price volatility. Source: CryptoQuant However, the estimated leverage ratio has yet to hit extreme levels, giving Ethereum room to continue with the uptrend. The newly opened positions on the derivatives market appear to be longs. This is seen in the rising funding rates to a three-month high. When funding rates are rising, it shows an influx of long positions. It also indicates that long traders are willing to pay a higher fee to maintain their positions, further suggesting that there is a bullish bias in the market. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, Ethereum’s open interest continues to rise, and at press time, it was at a five-month high of $16.61 billion per Coinglass data. In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion, further showing that speculative interest in ETH is high. The spike in trading activity and open positions in the derivatives market increases the likelihood of high volatility. It could also indicate that ETH could be on the verge of an overheated market. However, technical indicators suggest that an ETH bull run could also be underway. Ethereum is currently testing crucial resistance at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on its one-day chart. If ETH manages to flip this price level at $2,955, it could lead to a sustained uptrend. Flipping this resistance could also pave the way for a 12% rally to the 1.618 Fibonacci level ($3,260). Source: Tradingview The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests that more gains lie ahead. This metric has flipped positive and has also made a sharp move north, which shows that the uptrend is gaining strength. However, traders should watch out for signs of profit-taking as selling pressure could see the price drop to test support at $2,700. A drop below this support could usher in a downtrend. On 7th November, the total inflows to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $79.74 million, their highest level since August according to SoSoValue. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) ETF had the highest inflows of $28 million, followed by the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust with $23 million inflows. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The VanEck Ethereum Trust also recorded $12 million inflows marking its first inflows in two weeks. If the demand for ETH ETFs continues, it could bode well for Ethereum’s price.

Title: AIL Preview: St Mary’s and Terenure get ready to renew acquaintances

It’s been a while. Too long really. But seven seasons on from their last meeting in the Energia All-Ireland, the neighbouring Dublin 6 parishes of St Mary’s and Terenure renew acquaintances at Templeville Road again on Saturday afternoon. The last time they met was in March 2018 at Lakelands Park, when Terenure won 35-3. This long-awaited rematch has already brought 330 to the prematch lunch, with another 2,000-plus expected to walk up. They’ll come from far and wide to be there for a game which is also being streamed on irishrugby+. Of course, the rivalries and even friendships in some cases start at the respective schools, both of whom are showing signs of an overdue revival. St Mary’s won their first Leinster Schools Junior Cup final in 27 years by beating Terenure in the final last March. To add even more importance to this fixture, each has won three of five games to date, with St Mary’s sitting above Terenure in third thanks to accumulating six bonus points to their rivals’ four. Mary’s bring in winger Mark Fogarty and flanker Ethan Baxter to a rejigged backrow, while Terenure also make two changes; Jules Fenelon on the wing and loosehead Ben Howard. Leaders Clontarf host fifth-placed Young Munster in a repeat of the taut semi-final two years ago while Lansdowne, sitting in seventh, are in serious need of a win at home to second-placed Ballynahinch. The champions Cork Con, above Lansdowne on points difference after also losing three from five, make the trek to a City of Armagh side buoyed by their win in Terenure a fortnight ago. The bottom two, Garryowen and UCD, meet in Dooradoyle. The top two in 1B, Old Belvedere and Nenagh Ormond, are at home to Highfield and Queen’s, while in 2A the unbeaten pacesetters Galwegians and Cashel are away to Barnhall and at home to Navan ahead of their summit meeting next week in Galway. Men’s Division 1A (all 2.30pm): City of Armagh v Cork Constitution, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Young Munster, Castle Avenue; Garryowen v UCD, Dooradoyle; Lansdowne v Ballynahinch, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; St Mary’s College v Terenure College, Templeville Road.

To put it more precisely: The Wall Street giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has now surpassed its iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets—a remarkable feat given the fact that the former product has only existed since January. The iShares Gold ETF has been offered since 2005; BlackRock acquired the business and brand from Barclays in 2009. As of market close on Thursday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now accumulated an astonishing $33.17 billion in value, according to data self-reported by the firm. BlackRock’s gold ETF now trails that figure slightly, with $32.96 billion in net assets. Bitcoin and gold are often seen as comparable stores of value, with BTC long referred to as "digital gold" by many cryptocurrency advocates. BlackRock’s Bitcoin strength was unquestionably bolstered by Donald Trump’s re-election on Tuesday, a seismic event that has sent markets surging. The day after Trump retook the White House, the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw its highest-ever daily trading volume at $4.1 billion. That activity outpaced even daily volume on blue chip stocks like Netflix, Visa, and Berkshire Hathaway during the same period, according to Bloomberg Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas—a signal of enthusiasm among investors that Trump will indeed make good on his myriad promises to end the U.S. government’s crypto crackdown and champion the novel industry. On Thursday, BlackRock saw its largest ever net inflow for the iShares spot Bitcoin ETF with $1.12 billion. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust U.S. data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt at the time. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs currently on offer on Wall Street, BlackRock’s is handily the largest. The next closest in size, Grayscale’s, currently holds $16.79 billion worth of Bitcoin—roughly half as much as BlackRock.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows

Yesterday, Bitcoin had one of its most bullish days in history, skyrocketing past its all-time high to reach $76,990. This new milestone has ignited widespread excitement and confidence among investors, who now see the potential for further gains. Key data from Carl Runefelt reveals that Bitcoin ETFs experienced a historic surge, with $1.38 billion in net daily inflows. This record-breaking figure highlights institutional demand for Bitcoin, as major players like BlackRock are buying BTC in anticipation of long-term growth. The influx into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption, with increasing interest from financial giants as they recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and hedge against economic uncertainty. Runefelt’s analysis suggests that this level of demand is unprecedented, marking a turning point that could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The recent surge is not just a technical breakout but also a fundamental shift driven by institutional confidence, setting Bitcoin up for potential further highs as large-scale investors continue to enter the market. Bitcoin has surged into uncharted territory, breaking its previous all-time highs once again to reach a new peak that has captivated the crypto community. This historic rally comes on the heels of the U.S. election, which saw Donald Trump emerge victorious. Market sentiment suggests that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could have played a role in driving renewed confidence among U.S. investors, who are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge amid changing economic policies. Adding to this momentum, traditional investors increasingly pour into Bitcoin through ETFs, marking a significant shift in institutional interest. According to key data from SoSo Value, shared by prominent analyst Carl Runefelt on X, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-breaking daily inflows yesterday, totaling an astounding $1.38 billion. This historic inflow underscores the growing appetite from institutional players who are viewing Bitcoin as a critical asset for their portfolios. The recent bullish shift among institutions follows a prolonged 7-month accumulation phase that had cast shadows of doubt over Bitcoin’s potential to break new highs this year. Many investors remained cautious, with market volatility and uncertainty testing their confidence. With institutional backing at record levels, Bitcoin’s recent rally could signify the beginning of an extended bullish phase. As big players like BlackRock buy-in through ETFs, the market sees this as a signal of renewed strength. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next moves, with analysts suggesting the recent price action may only be the beginning of a larger bull run for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is trading at $76,000 after reaching new all-time highs. BTC is entering a strong consolidation phase above the previous record level of $73,800. This price zone is crucial for bulls, as holding above it could provide stability for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. Analysts are closely watching this level; if BTC can respect it, the bullish momentum may persist, encouraging further gains. However, the recent euphoria could lead to a consolidation phase just below $77,000—a level some experts identify as a short-term local top. This resistance could take time to overcome as the market digests recent gains and awaits fresh catalysts for another breakout. Despite potential consolidation, demand remains robust, and on-chain data reflects strong buying pressure that could continue driving the price upward. The technical outlook suggests further upside potential if Bitcoin can stay above $73,800 over the coming days. Bulls are optimistic, as it could establish a solid foundation for the next leg up in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally.

IBIT now third highest fund flow of all US ETFs in 2024 with $26 billion inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has secured the third-highest year-to-date inflows among US ETFs in 2024, attracting $26.174 billion. With a year-to-date return of 48.52% and assets under management reaching $30.1 billion, IBIT has outperformed many traditional ETFs in both inflows and performance. Further, IBIT’s YTD return is almost double the next highest from any of the other top 10 ETFs by fund flow. However, IBIT’s total AUM is more than ten times smaller than the other top four funds. Top US ETFs Fund Flows (Source: Trading View) Yesterday, Nov. 7, in a single day, IBIT experienced an inflow of $1.1 billion, surpassing the annual flows of all but the top 150 ETFs in the United States. This significant influx exceeds the total year-to-date flows of the majority of the approximately 3,300 ETFs available in the US market. US ETF YTD inflows matching IBIT daily inflow (Source: Trading View) The substantial inflows into IBIT emphasize the outsized investor interest in Bitcoin-based financial products. The ETF’s performance reflects a broader trend of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets within mainstream investment portfolios. Other top ETFs by inflows include Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) with $88.168 billion and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $57.539 billion in year-to-date flows. These funds have year-to-date returns of 25.69%, highlighting the strong performance of equity markets alongside the remarkable gains in digital assets. IBIT’s ascent in the ETF rankings indicates a shift in investor sentiment, signaling potential long-term implications for the asset management industry. The ETF’s success may encourage more firms to launch Bitcoin-focused products, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets.

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By BL Bengaluru Bureau Comments READ LATER Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. At the upper price band, Swiggy’s valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently holds a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy IPO GMP is indicating a muted listing gain as the shares of the company are commanding a GMP in the price range of ₹1-2, according to IPO Watch and Investor gain which track the grey market activities. “Swiggy’s growth relies heavily on its ability to expand offerings while retaining and attracting users in a cost-effective way. However, the company faces intense competition from Zomato, which enjoys a broad customer base and strong brand loyalty, particularly in the food delivery sector. This competitive landscape puts pressure on Swiggy’s market share, challenging its ability to maintain and grow its customer base. If Swiggy is unable to retain existing customers or attract new users affordably, it risks negative impacts on its business performance, financial stability, and operational results. Effectively managing these challenges is critical for Swiggy’s sustained growth in the highly competitive food delivery industry,” said Samco Securities “The company is an emerging e-commerce and food delivery technology service provider. It has shown steady growth in revenue over the reported periods but has consistently reported losses. Based on its financial performance, the IPO has a negative P/E ratio and is considered aggressively priced according to other metrics. The management is confident in turning operations profitable within the next few years by implementing their strategy and utilizing the IPO funds to scale up their offerings. Well-informed investors with cash surplus and a higher risk tolerance may consider investing moderate funds for the long term,” according to Bajaj Broking Research. Swiggy has a 34 per cent market share in food delivery compared to Zomato’s 58 per cent, while in quick commerce Swiggy’s Instamart has 20-25 per cent share, and Zomato’s Blinkit has an estimated 40-45 per cent share, according to brokerage estimates. The company is betting big on enhancing quick commerce segment as it plans to allocate nearly ₹1,179 crore to its Instamart business. The company will invest ₹755.4 crore in expanding its dark store network, while lease and licence payments for dark stores would amount to ₹423.3 crore. At the end of the June quarter, Swiggy Instamart had 557 dark stores. The fresh investment will take this number to 741. Swiggy reported an operating revenue of ₹3,222 crore in the June quarter, with its net loss up at ₹611 crore from ₹564 crore a year ago. During the same period, Instamart clocked a gross order value (GOV) of ₹2,724 crore and revenue of ₹403 crore. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Based on its financial performance, the IPO has a negative P/E ratio and is considered aggressively priced according to other metrics. The management is confident in turning operations profitable within the next few years by implementing their strategy and utilizing the IPO funds to scale up their offerings. Well-informed investors with cash surplus and a higher risk tolerance may consider investing moderate funds for the long term,” according to Bajaj Broking Research. Swiggy has a 34 per cent market share in food delivery compared to Zomato’s 58 per cent, while in quick commerce Swiggy’s Instamart has 20-25 per cent share, and Zomato’s Blinkit has an estimated 40-45 per cent share, according to brokerage estimates. The company is betting big on enhancing quick commerce segment as it plans to allocate nearly ₹1,179 crore to its Instamart business. The company will invest ₹755.4 crore in expanding its dark store network, while lease and licence payments for dark stores would amount to ₹423.3 crore. At the end of the June quarter, Swiggy Instamart had 557 dark stores. The fresh investment will take this number to 741. Swiggy reported an operating revenue of ₹3,222 crore in the June quarter, with its net loss up at ₹611 crore from ₹564 crore a year ago. During the same period, Instamart clocked a gross order value (GOV) of ₹2,724 crore and revenue of ₹403 crore. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: $1 Billion in 24 Hours: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Breaks Records

U.Today - In an extraordinary demonstration of demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. funds saw a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion as Bitcoin itself hit new all-time highs. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s IBIT fund dominated the inflows, attracting a record $1.12 billion of the total, reflecting the hype of recent events and a growing appetite for regulated BTC exposure among traditional investors. Most definitely, more and more people are weighing in on Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which shows that investors are beginning to prefer safe, regulated Bitcoin-based financial products over direct exposure. This increased interest is a sign that the retail side of the market is moving toward digital assets, especially as institutions like BlackRock offer access to the cryptocurrency through structured and compliant investment vehicles. Meanwhile, this ETF-driven activity parallels Bitcoin's upward momentum, with the cryptocurrency hitting all-time highs for three consecutive days. Ethereum-based ETFs have also caught the attention of investors, recording the third-highest single-day inflow in history, bringing in $79 million during the last trading session. This development suggests that interest in crypto-backed financial products may extend beyond Bitcoin, suggesting a more diversified approach by investors looking to tap into a wider range of digital assets or trying to catch up through beta, as Ethereum lags significantly behind BTC in terms of price action.

Title: Trump’s return could herald a ‘crypto golden age’ says CEO of stablecoin firm Paxos

Cryptocurrencies surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, as crypto investors hope for a more friendly regulatory regime under a Republican president. Flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin briefly surpassed $75,000; other tokens like Ether and Dogecoin saw significant gains. Trump’s election creates “a real opportunity for a crypto golden age,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, a New York-based blockchain platform, on Friday at the Singapore Fintech Festival. “The Trump campaign had a real crypto theme around it, and there’s a sense all this pent-up demand could be unleashed by the U.S. and turn the U.S. into a leader from kind of a laggard,” he explained. The Republican campaign promoted Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate, accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Trump said at a bitcoin conference in July in Nashville that he would ensure the U.S. never sells off its Bitcoin holdings if he returned to the White House, and that it would be a policy in his administration to keep 100% of the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires in future. He also said he would establish a crypto presidential advisory council and create a national “stockpile” of bitcoin. A Reuters report in August, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, claimed the U.S. holds about $11.1 billion in crypto, which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens. Washington’s stash of cryptocurrencies come from criminal seizures from government agencies like the FBI and IRS. Trump also launched World Liberty Financial, a “decentralised finance” initiative centred around a crypto token called WLFI in September. In October, World Liberty Financial revealed it was slashing its fundraising goal in a regulatory filing. The company now plans to raise up to $30 million from investors, a 90% reduction from its initial target of $300 million. Other speakers on Friday suggested that the U.S. was already moving towards a more crypto-friendly stance. Eric Anziani, president of Crypto.com, said “a clear direction was set” when Bitcoins and Ethereum ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. The approved ETFs included funds from well-known investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco. Global regulators are also starting to treat crypto as a more mainstream asset. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, pointed to new Bitcoin ETFs in markets like Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. Yet “the election [marks] the beginning of a new era,” Anziani said. A new Trump election could give more clarity on cryptocurrency regulations. The size of the U.S. market could then jumpstart the crypto industry, Cascarilla argued. Billionaires with ties to the cryptocurrency industry, including Elon Musk and the Winklevoss twins, had endorsed or donated to Trump’s campaign Crypto firms have blasted Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for cracking down on U.S.-based cryptocurrency firms. Investors now hope that a new Trump administration will replace Gensler with someone more friendly to the crypto sector. “The SEC for the past few years has been waging a war on [the crypto] industry,” Monica Long, president of Ripple, said on Friday. “It’s really hard to navigate an environment like that.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

By Martin Pengelly in Washington, A new book by the chief architect of Project 2025, a hugely controversial policy plan for a second Trump term, repeatedly employs imagery of fire and burning, including calling for rightwingers to “burn away the rot” of American institutions and organizations deemed opposed to conservative aims. The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to “bring down the temperature” after months of heated political battle. Mixing classical quotes with cliche (“it is time to fight fire with fire”) and metaphors about forest fires and Smokey Bear , Kevin Roberts, president of the far-right Heritage Foundation, advocates “a long, controlled burn” of targets including the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the New York Times, “every Ivy League college” and even the Boy Scouts of America. Related: ‘This victory is a mandate’: rightwing groups ready with policy proposals for new Trump administration Roberts’s book, Dawn’s Early Light : Taking Back Washington to Save America, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy, but the book has proved controversial already. This summer, news outlets used review copies to report violent imagery in an introduction by the Ohio senator JD Vance , Trump’s vice-presidential pick, and to highlight both Roberts’s own violent language and his work on Project 2025 . Roberts’s original subtitle – Burning Down Washington to Save America – also attracted attention, as did incendiary language in promotional materials. As Trump sought to distance himself from the book and Project 2025, including by lying about not knowing Roberts, publication was postponed until after election day. Now, with Trump victorious, Roberts’s heated rhetoric seems likely to alarm progressives all over again. Beginning with a quote from Virgil’s Aeneid – “My spirit kindles to fire, and rises in wrath to avenge my dying land” – Roberts writes: “In 2020, our country went up in flames. “Some of those conflagrations were intentional arson, such as the ‘mostly peaceful’ protests [for racial justice after the police murder of George Floyd] that caused more than a billion dollars in damage [a controversial claim ] in some of America’s greatest cities: Others were more unintentional, such as the record-setting California wildfires that torched more than 4 million acres of our most beautiful forests. “In fact, all those fires were connected. They spring from a conspiracy against nature – against ordered, civilized societies, against common sense and normal people – orchestrated by a network of political, corporate, and cultural elites who share a set of interests quite apart from those of ordinary Americans. “… Be it Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the cities or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the countryside, the … playbook is the same: destroy the embodied institutions that define the American way of life and replace them with ideological commitments and bureaucratic imperatives. “It is time to fight fire with fire.” Alluding to prominent Project 2025 aims – including political purges of the federal government and legal attacks on groups including women and LGBTQ+ Americans – Roberts continues: “Fire has the potential to destroy … To escape our current darkness, restore America’s civic life and take back our country for good, conservatives can’t merely continue putting out fires; we must be brave enough to go on the offense, strike the match and start a long, controlled burn. “There’s plenty of fuel. Like deadwood in a forest, many of America’s institutions have been completely hollowed out … Decadent and rootless, these institutions serve only as shelter for our corrupt elite. Meanwhile, they block out the light and suck up the nutrients necessary for new American institutions to grow. For America to flourish again, they don’t need to be reformed; they need to be burned. A nice start would include: “Every Ivy League college, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, 80% of ‘Catholic’ higher education, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, the Boy Scouts of America, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, and the National Endowment for Democracy.” Roberts does not elaborate on qualifications for his list. But it does contain one name that may jar with rightwing readers: BlackRock, a major financial firm, has been a key investor in Trump Media & Technology Group, the president-elect’s social media company. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s billionaire co-founder, has been linked to an appointment as treasury secretary under Trump. Turning from Virgil – and the composer Gustav Mahler – to Smokey Bear, Roberts says the US Forest Service mascot might not approve of his aims. But, he insists, “any good conservationist can tell you that fire is an intrinsic part of the cycle of life … without regular controlled burns, a conflagration eventually occurs that wrecks the forest rather than renews it.” Saying his aim is “to inspire the New Conservative Movement to rekindle the fire of the American tradition, and to empower real Americans to take back our country”, Roberts says that despite advocating burning down the FBI, he represents “the Party of Creation” against “the Party of Destruction – those who seek to abolish the existing order in the name of emancipation, freedom, and progress”. Related: The force behind Project 2025: Kevin Roberts has the roadmap for a second Trump term Roberts’s fiery imagery and rhetoric does not end there. Elsewhere, he compares progressive policies to Dutch elm disease, with affected bodies needing to be “promptly burned”; says “the only way to revive” institutions “haggard with age, decay, and bloat, is to burn away the rot”; and even meditates on the nature of fire itself. “Man’s taming of fire is the cornerstone of human culture,” Roberts muses. “That’s the funny thing about fire. It is so fleeting, a flame flickering from moment to moment, yet in its evanescence, it is eternal. Of all the elements, fire is most associated with transformation, renewal, and change. You can’t have a blaze without some kind of sacrificial transformation of fuel into fire. Yet precisely for this reason, fire demands an attention to continuity. Unlike any of the other elements, fire dies … a fire must be continually tended.” Particularly, it seems, if it is set under the Boy Scouts of America.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs set new record with $1.36 billion combined daily inflow. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic inflow of $1.12 billion on Nov. 7, surpassing previous combined totals for all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This significant capital movement marks the largest single-day inflow in the history of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other major asset managers also reported notable inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC received $190.9 million, while Bitwise’s BITB increased by $13.4 million. Ark’s ARKB gained $17.6 million on the same day, according to data compiled on Nov. 7. The combined inflow hit $1.37 billion, marking the best day in spot Bitcoin ETF history since they launched in January. These inflows coincide with Bitcoin breaking the all-time high several times to a peak of $76,900, breaking previous records twice since the US presidential election on Nov. 5. The surge in Bitcoin’s price and ETF inflows suggests increased institutional interest following the election results. The ETF’s unprecedented inflow outpaced the previous combined total for all similar funds, signaling a potential shift in institutional investment strategies following Trump’s win.

Title: What Trump’s Election Really Means For Crypto?

Donald Trump pledges to make U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the Planet” at 2024 Bitcoin Conference in ... [+] Nashville. Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the crypto landscape could be on the cusp of a major transformation. Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, commitment to reforming crypto regulations, and vocal opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies suggest that U.S. crypto leadership may strengthen significantly in the coming years. Throughout his campaign, Trump has openly supported Bitcoin, aiming to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” He even proposed integrating Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy by creating a national Bitcoin reserve. This pro-Bitcoin stance aligns with Trump’s view that the U.S. should lead in digital finance. Despite years of political and regulatory challenges, the U.S. remains a powerhouse for crypto-focused businesses, driving significant economic impact. Leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pioneering tokenized funds, while VISA and Mastercard offer credit cards linked to crypto wallets, demonstrating mainstream adoption. The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, with $4.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, underscores the industry’s scale. In Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins transacted $8.5 trillion—outpacing Visa’s $3.9 trillion—lead partly by U.S.-based issuers like Circle, Paxos, and PayPal. This leadership highlights the high stakes for regulatory clarity. Some major U.S. companies drive global crypto innovation despite regulatory hurdles, including ... [+] Coinbase, BlackRock, Fidelity, Mastercard, PayPal, Circle and more. Photo by Smith Collection. Under Trump, the regulatory landscape could undergo significant changes. Trump has pledged to dismantle what he views as restrictive regulations, beginning with the dismissal of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whom he blames for the “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump could establish more straightforward, growth-oriented policies by appointing a more crypto-friendly SEC leader. Christopher Perkins, President of the New York-based crypto investment firm CoinFund, highlights the momentum, noting, “The elections in the U.S. were wildly positive for the crypto industry. While Trump has indicated he will be a crypto President, it’s important to note that 261 pro-crypto candidates were elected to Congress. This is the first ‘crypto’ Congress.” Perkins emphasizes, “We expect regulatory clarity, but not overly prescriptive regulation,” describing the outlook as “very bullish for the crypto industry—full stop.” U.S. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at a 2023 House Financial Services Committee hearing on the lawsuits ... [+] against Binance and Coinbase. With Trump’s vow “to fire” Gensler, the focus of crypto regulation may be poised for change. Photo by Jacquelyn Martin. Trump’s opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is clearly rooted in privacy and individual freedom concerns. He supported the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC without congressional approval—a stance echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump’s anti-CBDC position could also influence global trends significantly as central banks like the European Central Bank move forward with their digital currencies. The ECB’s planned CBDC designed to provide accessible, standardized payments across the eurozone, has thus far received limited political attention in Europe, despite concerns over its potential to crowd out the private sector. However, Jonas Gross, Chairman of the Digital Euro Association, believes Trump’s vocal stance could shift this: “If Trump is outspoken against CBDCs, we may see more discussions within the European Parliament,” he suggests, indicating that Trump’s influence may prompt increased scrutiny of the ECB’s approach. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is developing a CBDC for the eurozone—a form of digital money ... [+] issued by a central bank, an approach Trump has firmly rejected. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds. Europe has led the way in crypto regulation, with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) set to take effect by year’s end. Joachim Schwerin, Principal Economist at the European Commission, notes that Europe’s regulatory path reflects its commitment to “balanced, sustainable growth for crypto,” a stance that has already attracted leading U.S. crypto firms seeking European MiCAR licenses. While Trump’s re-election may create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S., Schwerin believes Europe’s approach will remain steady. However, he acknowledges that global competition is heating up, with nations like the Emirates and Switzerland establishing robust frameworks to attract crypto innovation. Crypto enables global transactions across borders and fosters international competition for human ... [+] capital and resources. Regulatory clarity is essential for crypto to allow innovation to flourish. Despite past regulatory challenges, the U.S. has built a strong crypto sector, with major U.S. players driving growth and innovation. Trump’s election could unlock even greater potential by establishing supportive crypto regulation. With a pro-crypto Congress and supportive regulators, the U.S. could strengthen its lead and emerge as the world’s primary hub for decentralized finance. Trump’s anti-CBDC stance may also shape global discussions, prompting central banks to reconsider centralized models. Together, these shifts could position America as a leader in digital finance, navigating a competitive landscape where Europe has already laid significant regulatory groundwork. Yet, as Rhys Bidder, Deputy Director at the Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance, observes, “There have been false dawns for crypto before... the hope must be that the industry builds in a sustainable manner.” With this new U.S. administration, crypto has a unique opportunity to prove itself as a mature and credible sector, dispelling doubts and moving beyond its volatile past.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin posted a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the digital-asset industry and promise of supportive regulations. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for about 81% of Thursday’s deluge, which came a day after the ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $1.1 billion of net subscriptions for the fund — also known as IBIT — was also unprecedented. The surging investor demand helped to push Bitcoin to another all-time high, with the original cryptocurrency rising as much as 1.7% to $77,272 on Friday. It has set fresh record highs every day since Tuesday. The demand for the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund is another sign of how Trump’s pledge to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry is reshaping the crypto market. Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of crypto exchange BTC Markets Pty, said there is a “significant risk of a feedback loop, where rising ETF inflows push Bitcoin prices higher, attracting more capital.” Much depends now on Trump following through on campaign vows, such as creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. Some technical indicators suggest a two-month rally driven by optimism about Trump’s reelection is now due for a pause. Bitcoin’s roughly 80% advance so far in 2024, partly fueled by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, exceeds the returns from traditional investments such as global stocks and gold.

IBIT pulled in a total of $1.12 billion on Thursday, beating out its prior October 30 record of $872 million, data from SoSoValue shows. The fund, which has emerged as a dominant force among its 10 other rivals, has a net asset value of $34.2 billion, bolstered by Bitcoin’s heightened value. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust US data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Investor interest in the world's largest crypto is at an all-time high, which has driven record-setting heights for the asset, above $76,870, amid surging activity among altcoins and meme coins. “The ETFs are accumulating Bitcoin faster than it can be created by a factor of two to one,” Hundal added. “Sooner or later, this will tip across into a broad-based crypto rally. Probably sooner.” It comes as IBIT posted a record $4 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, vastly exceeding its nearest rival, Fidelity, after President-elect Donald Trump secured a second term as the 47th president of the United States. Trump’s Whitehouse win is viewed by many in the industry as a boon for digital assets. He has promised to protect crypto mining interests, establish a Bitcoin reserve, and usher in favorable policy. The ascent of IBIT as a top Bitcoin ETF comes amid shifting sentiment over investments in institutionalized crypto. The fund has maintained steady inflows since inception, while competitor Grayscale's GBTC—the second largest by net assets at $16.8 billion—has faced negative outflows due to its high fees. BlackRock charges a 0.25% fee, waived until January, while GBTC charges significantly higher at 1.5%. Fidelity’s FBTC, meanwhile, also charges 0.25%, though its waiver ended in July.

Title: Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: ‘We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman’

It’s a blustery Dublin day and I’m cycling northside, thinking of Kathleen Watkins. I’m thinking about her elegance and sense of fun and the conversation that flowed from her like music. She died on Thursday having turned 90 last month. She was let out of the hospital especially for that celebration which, I have it on good authority, included afternoon tea and champagne. Our paths had crossed over the years through her late husband, the legendary broadcaster Gay Byrne, and at children’s concerts around town. Her beloved grandchildren and my daughters attended the same music school. I used to look forward to watching her in the audience, wearing a brightly coloured scarf and even brighter lipstick, the proudest, most besotted of grandmothers, lost in the music. But I knew her by reputation long before any of that. Kathleen Watkins, a woman who kept her own surname after marriage back when that was an eyebrow-raising decision, was something of a star past-pupil of my secondary school. She played the harp at Sion Hill in Blackrock, Co Dublin, and later went on to become the first continuity announcer at RTÉ. I’m sad but I’m smiling as I cycle home having just heard the news that she’s gone. There was always fun to be had with Kathleen. Things were “marvellous”, people were “darling”, food was “just divine” and memorable happenings were “the greatest times of my life”. She was one of the most enthusiastic people I’ve ever met. Arranging a lunch a couple of years ago, she texted a string of red wine emojis in anticipation. A mutual friend was celebrating her 70th birthday. “Oh, to be so young,” she texted. She was about to turn 88 herself by that stage. At lunch she was full of stories and plans and endless, fascinating conversation that covered art and music and theatre and family. There were stories of holidays in Donegal where she and Gay palled around with Brian and Anne Friel. My daughters arrived towards the end of the lunch and under pressure from their pushy mother one of them reluctantly recited a poem she’d written. (Well, you try reading your teenage rhymes to a table of adults that included poetry curator Kathleen Watkins and author Marie Heaney, wife of Nobel laureate Seamus.) One of the many great things about Kathleen was that she knew she’d had a wonderful life and she appreciated it deeply. As wife of the host of The Late Late Show she was Gay’s plus-one to glittering events and first-nights, many of which were arts-related, which suited both their interests. Neither of them were party people but they loved cultural goings-on of all kinds. It was “a charmed life”, she would say. “God is too good to me”. It was a more challenging life after losing Gay, who died almost exactly five years ago. They would have been 60 years married last June. She was full of the memories of their partnership. She loved “his sense of humour, the unexpected off-the-cuff quip, he was so smart”. She told me about the way he’d compliment her, noticing a well-tailored new suit she’d bought, saying “well done, Kaysie”. (He called her Kay or Kaysie, never Kathleen and she called him Gabsie. She was Nana Kit to her grandchildren and she answered to nothing else). She told me she missed Gay dreadfully. “But then I’m very spoiled,” she said of having her two daughters Suzy and Crona close by. As well as being endlessly interested in the arts, in music and in poetry, Kathleen was also a massive reader and rugby fan; she finished reading Johnny Sexton’s autobiography Obsessed last week. She’d often watch Sky Arts at 6am in the morning, entranced by ballet productions or concerts live from the Sydney Opera House. A mutual friend remembers going to annual lunches in her and Gay’s apartment in Sandymount, where they’d host his old Late Late Show production team. There were several sketches of Kathleen by Seán Keating hung in the hall, he remembers. Keating was a struggling artist when they were made. Kathleen would sit for him in his lodgings, which had a single bar electric heater, and pay for the drawings, a way of supporting the artist financially without making him feel embarrassed. It’s astonishing to think she began a career as a children’s author in her eighties, with the Pigín books. She was also involved in a number of poetry podcasts. I interviewed her four years ago around the publication of her book One For Everyone, a collection of her favourite poems. I admired how she was never “high falutin’” about poetry. “I’m not a bit like that. I feel poetry is for everybody.” She was particularly fond of a poem called Love After Love by Derek Walcott, she said it spoke to everyone. What did it say to her? “Well, sometimes you put yourself on the back burner. So take time, be at peace, be calm, look and see who you are. Who you were. Things are good aren’t they? They could be worse. Feast on your life, the poem says. That’s important. I was always a glass pretty full person.” There were three poems by the late Derek Mahon in the book, which was dedicated to her late husband with a simple “For Gay”. The final poem in the book, Everything Is Going to be Alright, was the one she believed Byrne would have liked the best and one that gave her comfort as she navigated life without him. “There will be dying, there will be dying, but there is no need to get into that ... Everything is going to be all right.” We’d been texting regularly in recent months, trying to make plans to meet up “for a chat and a cuppa” – we didn’t get around to it and I am now very sad and sorry about that. Still, we were in touch as she managed visits and stays in the Blackrock Clinic where she told me she watched the racing in Cheltenham – “it helps to pass the time”. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] We exchanged war stories, she was always putting a positive spin on even the worst events. She had suffered a few ailments and she texted one day: “a hip problem and two mini-strokes. Never knew they happened. Feeling good”. I told her some of my own troubles. “Lotsa love, K,” she wrote in reply, with some encouraging words that lifted my spirits at a dark time. She was a great one for prayers, “not a holy joe” she clarified to me once, but she was a woman who loved a good Mass. She credited her longevity to “genes and the luck of the draw”. Kathleen had so many poems in her head right until the end, her memory sharp, recalling the words she held dear. She once told me that Gay loved her to recite Beannacht by John O’Donohoe. That poem contains these lines: “When the canvas frays/ In the currach of thought/ And a stain of ocean/ Blackens beneath you,/ May there come across the waters,/ A path of yellow moonlight,/ To bring you safely home.” Lotsa love to you, Kathleen. We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman. Safe home. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Poulet Bonne Femme takeaway review: Delicious and succulent roast chicken with all the trimmings

Husband and wife team Gavin McCarthy and Sara Mitchell launched Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire’s farmers’ market in 2009. Laid off in the 2008 recession, with a newborn son and no interest in emigrating, they gambled Gavin’s redundancy on a rotisserie trailer. At first, they sold roast dinners; the sandwiches came later. With a commitment to high-quality Irish food, Poulet Bonne Femme sources free-range chickens from local farms and makes everything in-store daily. The focus is on family meals – rotisserie chicken, honey roast ham, pork with crackling, and roast Irish beef. Sides are all home-made, from roast potatoes to coleslaw, designed for easy midweek meals and the ultimate Sunday roast. Worth noting is the fact that they are also doing pre-prepared dinners for Christmas, which come with the full works: boned and rolled turkey, honey ham, and every side you’d expect. There are six concessions in Avoca stores around Ireland and there are two stand-alone stores – Blackrock and most recently, Dún Laoghaire, where there is also an area for sit-in. Rotisserie roast chicken, roast potatoes, roast root vegetables, stuffing and gravy. Very pleasant. I rang the Dún Laoghaire shop to check on availability and placed my order on the phone. I picked it up that evening. The rotisserie chicken was absolutely delicious. The skin was crisp and golden with a tasty savoury flavour. The wings were crispy and the leg and breast meat was succulent. The roast potatoes are baby potatoes with skins on, so not quite the crunchy delight you get with conventional roast potatoes. The root vegetables – mainly parsnip and carrots – were very good. The bread stuffing was loose, so needed to be moistened with melted butter, but there was a good taste of herbs running through it. The gravy was a bit muted and was improved by punching up the seasoning and adding a splash of wine and squeeze of lemon juice. Everything except the gravy (plastic container) was packed in paper or those round cardboard cartons we now associate with lockdown meal kits. So crushable and recyclable. €39.05 for dinner for four people: Rotisserie roast chicken, €15.95; roast potatoes, €6.95; roast root vegetables, €6.95; stuffing, €5.25; and gravy, €3.95. Open 9am-6pm in Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock. Sundays are a busy day so call ahead to order. Concessions serve from 10am to 5pm or 6pm. Email catering@poueltbonnefemme.com Yes, this is really good chicken and I love the fact that it’s free-range. Ordering the sides means you have a night off cooking.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $52.3M Inflows as U.S. Election Sparks Crypto Market Gains

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The U.S. spot Ether ETFs experienced a significant boost in inflows just after the U.S. presidential election. The Total inflows for the nine Ethereum ETFs hit $52.3 million. According to data from Farside Investors, this was the largest inflow the Ether-based ETFs had seen in six weeks. The recent inflow is Ethereum’s best performance since late September. The inflow coincided with a 10% price increase in Ethereum, pushing the price of ETH to an intraday high of $2,872, the highest since early August. While $52.3 million may seem small compared to inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it was a big win for Ethereum investors. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a whopping $622 million in inflows on the same day. According to the data, the inflows were primarily driven by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust. Fidelity’s fund attracted the largest share, pulling in $26.9 million. Grayscale followed closely behind with $25.4 million. However, the remaining seven spot Ether ETFs reported zero inflows, leaving a mixed picture for the overall Ether ETF market. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, a leading Ethereum ETF, reported no daily net flows. This stood out as BlackRock is one of the biggest names in the market, and its lack of inflows surprised many. Despite no new funds entering BlackRock’s ETF, investor interest in Ether ETFs remained strong. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has faced significant challenges since its conversion to spot Ether ETF in July. The fund has witnessed more outflows than inflows, with large chunks of capital exiting it daily. Some believe its high fee could be the reason for such occurrence. Since July, Grayscale has seen its assets under management shrink by $3.1 billion. This has contributed to a net outflow of $490 million across all Ethereum ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs maintain dominance over the crypto ETF market, with daily flows significantly exceeding that of Ether ETFs. According to Farside Investor, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive inflow of $621.9 million. This marked a reversal in the trend, as the ETFs had seen three consecutive days of outflows before the election. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the inflows, recording $308.8 million, its largest inflow since June. Several other Bitcoin ETFs also performed well, with Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale all seeing inflows exceeding $100 million each. However, not every Bitcoin ETF had a positive day. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reported outflows for the second consecutive day. IBIT lost $69.1 million in net outflows, according to preliminary data. Despite this, November 6 was BlackRock’s highest volume day, with $4.1 billion traded. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips. Subscribe now!

It’s a comeback story for the ages: Despite two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, 34 felony convictions, and coverage from the big three networks that was 85% negative (as opposed to 78% positive for his opponent), former President Donald Trump triumphed over all the hate and the haters to win his second term in the Oval Office. Why? Trump was a better president than President Joe Biden and a better candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris. Ordinary Americans enjoyed measurably more fruitful lives under Trump than Biden. And Trump is noticeably more authentic, relatable, charming, clever, convincing, insightful, intuitive and fun than Harris. Trump won on both policy and personality. Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America — media, academia, and big business, too — not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. Oh, and the movie and rock stars, too. Harrison Ford movingly told us over the weekend that he voted for Harris and Tim Walz. The core of his pitch was that “these two people believe in the rule of law; they believe in science; they believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans. They believe that we are in this together… Look, I’m frustrated about a lot of things in this country, I’m sure you are, too. But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other, while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.” It is a passionate pitch, but it fell flat because most of us didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. For those of us who are frustrated about what the government has been doing, it’s merely a beautifully narrated lie. It was a call to trust the prosecutors and the judges who cynically used the courts as a partisan weapon while braying about their fealty to the “rule of law.” To believe government bureaucrats who silenced those who dared to question the origins and effects of COVID-19 — and were later proven right. To ignore the dishonesty of national security officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake even though they knew it wasn’t. To forget that they ran for office claiming that they wanted to unite the country while working full-time to divide it — solely for the purpose of winning elections. We didn’t go along. So, Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. During his first trip overseas as president, Biden addressed the U.S. troops stationed in England. It wasn’t an auspicious beginning. “When I first was elected vice president with President Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were,” he said. “This is not a joke: you know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming.” Despite the disclaimer, a “joke” was exactly what this sounded like. Or, rather, a spoof of liberal excess. Biden was addressing men and women who had signed up to risk their lives on the battlefield to protect their fellow Americans. And he was giving them Democratic Party talking points. The obvious inference to be drawn is that the new commander in chief was in over his head and that the Pentagon is run by suck-ups or idiots. Both perceptions were reinforced soon thereafter, a few months later, by the United States’ disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. When a military focuses on something other than fighting wars, it is on the road to failure. Similarly, nearly all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with facilitating capital formation and discouraging fraud, not suppressing carbon emissions. FEMA’s core mission is to swiftly respond to and remediate disasters, not to find taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants. The FBI’s core mission is to protect citizens from crime and terrorism, not from conservative Catholics. And it is not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. If the information being conveyed does not reflect observable reality, then the press has failed in its core mission. Think of the memorable scenes of 2020 when cable news reporters would describe “mostly peaceful protests” while fires ravaged buildings behind them. The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated on campus today? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That is why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it is auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there is not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, during the COVID pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similar manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy who drives all those pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Trump and his merry band of bold critics — including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard — are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.
