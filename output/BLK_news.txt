BlackRock’s iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF signals institutional shift, balancing yield potential with regulatory uncertainty. The race for institutional crypto market dominance is heating up, shifting focus from mere price actions to yield generation. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has signaled this transition with the filing of its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF. Expanding on its massive, over $11 billion existing Ethereum fund, this proposed product marks BlackRock’s first U.S. offering designed to provide institutional clients with direct exposure to Ether’s staking rewards. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared this news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, Source: Eric Balchunas/X The iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF represents more than just a new product. It signals a major shift in how institutions approach digital assets. Rather than framing crypto purely as speculation, BlackRock is guiding investors toward protocol‑level economics and blockchain‑driven yield. The filing describes a hybrid fund designed to capture both ETH’s price performance and the staking rewards generated from a portion of its holdings. These rewards would, in turn, increase the trust’s net asset value. However, the filing also highlights a key tension. BlackRock aims to offer staking yield, but regulatory and operational uncertainties could still influence how those rewards are ultimately distributed. This move forces the SEC to finally clarify how staking rewards should be classified, an issue that has remained unclear for years. Remarking on the same, an X user commented, “This tells you everything about where demand is heading. They don’t file for products like this unless they’re confident massive capital is waiting to flow in.” BlackRock’s latest filing marks a major shift in Ethereum [ETH] ETF policy, one that seemed impossible under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. When BlackRock first launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024, the SEC forced issuers to remove staking from their products, arguing that services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase resembled unregistered securities offerings. Under the new Chair, Paul Atkins, however, the agency’s stance appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck have now resubmitted or amended ETF filings to add staking, with BlackRock choosing to create an entirely new fund rather than modify ETHA. The original trust, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking‑enabled version. This structure allows investors to gain regulated exposure to Ethereum’s yield‑generating mechanism without directly staking their assets. This policy shift builds on October’s milestone approval for Grayscale, which became the first issuer to offer staking rewards through U.S.‑listed spot‑market ETFs (ETHE and ETH Mini). It also aligns with broader industry momentum, as seen in REX‑Osprey’s staking‑enabled Solana [SOL] and ETH funds, signaling a growing institutional embrace of blockchain‑driven yield strategies. At the same time, on-chain activity suggests large institutions are rapidly accumulating Ethereum. Lookonchain reported substantial withdrawals from Binance involving 6,000 ETH by Amber Group and 3,000 ETH by Metalpha within hours of each other. Meanwhile, Bitmine made an even more aggressive move, adding 138,452 ETH to its holdings, bringing its total to 3.86 million ETH worth $12.4 billion. This surge in institutional buying coincides with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin signaling that an ETH rally may be approaching, even as ETH traded at $3,114 at press time, after a 1.67% daily drop. Source: X Together, rising institutional accumulation and the SEC’s warming stance on staking ETFs suggest that Ethereum’s market structure could accelerate the next phase of ETH adoption.

Title: Ether Surges 8%, Outpacing Bitcoin Gains Amid Staking ETF, Tokenization Optimism
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/09/ether-surges-8-outpacing-bitcoin-gains-amid-staking-etf-tokenization-optimism
Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:47:33Z
Full Content:
Ethereum's ether ETH$3,383.53 surged on Tuesday to its strongest price since mid-November, leading crypto markets higher as bitcoin BTC$92,395.13 climbed above $94,000. The second-largest cryptocurrency climbed to just shy of $3,400, rallying 8.4% over the past 24 hours. Those gains significantly outpaced bitcoin’s 4.5% advance and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index’s 6% climb. The rally also drove the ETH/BTC ratio — a closely-watched gauge of ether’s relative performance to bitcoin — to its strongest level since late October, signaling rotation into ETH from the leading crypto. Ether's rally and relative strengths against BTC is being driven by "improving regulatory expectations and renewed optimism around ETF-related inflows" with staking being added to funds on the horizon, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, said in a Tuesday note. Asset management giant BlackRock, issuer of the most popular spot ETH ETF, filed Monday to introduce the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust, which would provide yield from staking to investors. "The development revives optimism around ETH-focused inflows and the prospect of yield-bearing crypto products reaching a broader investor base," Kruger wrote. "While regulatory timelines remain uncertain, the headline has added more support to ETH’s relative stability versus bitcoin." ETH could also benefit from regulatory efforts to pave way for real-world asset tokenization, a fast-growing sector focusing on bringing financial instruments like bonds, funds and real estate onto smart contract platforms like Ethereum. Paul Atkins, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has touted tokenization a key innovation for capital markets, saying in an interview with Fox Business last week that it has the potential to change the financial system, reducing settlement risks and trade gaps.

More Info New York-based investment bank Xtellus Partners has proposed that proceeds from the sale of Lukoil's foreign assets be used to compensate American investors who lost money after their Lukoil stock holdings were frozen following Russia’s war in Ukraine. Leading U.S. asset managers such as Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and JP Morgan lost billions of dollars through writing off their Lukoil stocks holdings following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Xtellus has proposed a cashless sale back to Lukoil securities held by U.S. investors in exchange for the company's global assets. Lukoil's international assets are estimated at $22 billion, including upstream oil and gas projects, refining facilities and more than 2,000 filling stations ?across the globe. Buyers of the assets would have to come to an agreement with Lukoil before the U.S. Treasury can clear the transaction. Last month, U.S. Treasury issued the greenlight for companies to begin talks with Lukoil for its foreign assets, with U.S. oil and gas giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have already expressed interest. Exxon is in talks with Iraq’s Oil Ministry to buy Lukoil’s 75% stake in the West Qurna 2 oilfield, one of the country’s largest. Iraq's oil ministry has invited several U.S. oil companies to enter negotiations over the West Qurna 2 takeover through a competitive bidding process. West Qurna-2 oilfield produces more than 400,000 bpd of crude. The Iraqi government has taken over operations at West Qurna 2, including paying staff salaries directly. Meanwhile, the Serbian government is preparing an amendment to the country’s budget law that will allow it to nationalize the Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) refinery, majority owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft and Gazprom, if no third party offers quickly emerge. NIS has submitted a request to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to continue operations until negotiations for an ownership change conclude. Located in the city of Pancevo, near Belgrade, NIS is the only oil refinery in Serbia. The refinery has the capacity to process 4.8 million tons of crude per year. In the first half of 2025, the refinery processed approximately 1.677 million tons, a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2024, when a major maintenance turnaround was carried out.

Title: PNC Bank launches Bitcoin trading for eligible clients via Coinbase integration

The move makes PNC the first major US bank to offer spot Bitcoin trading within its own digital platform, starting with private bank clients. PNC Bank has begun offering direct spot Bitcoin trading to eligible private bank clients, becoming the first major US bank to enable buy, hold and sell functions inside its own digital platform. According to a Tuesday release, the launch marks the first phase of PNC’s partnership with Coinbase. Announced in July, the collaboration is supported by Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service trading and custody stack. PNC Private Bank serves high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, family offices and business owners. The bank plans to expand access to additional client groups and add more capabilities over time. According to Federal Reserve data, PNC ranks as the eighth-largest commercial bank in the US, with about $564 billion in assets and more than 2,300 branches across the country. While several major US banks have expanded their crypto offerings this year, most are targeting custody services or investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Dec. 2, Bank of America said that beginning next year, it will allow its wealth management clients to access four Bitcoin ETFs issued by Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale and BlackRock. The ETFs provide investors with exposure to the Bitcoin (BTC) price through a regulated fund that trades on stock exchanges, without the need to buy and hold the digital asset directly. Related: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, asset managers and crypto exchanges are expanding services to wealthy clients. In June, JPMorgan announced that it would allow its trading and wealth-management clients to use crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. The bank also said it would begin factoring clients’ crypto holdings into assessments of their overall net worth. Binance recently introduced a concierge-style service for family offices, asset managers and private funds entering the crypto market. Crypto allocations are also rising in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore, with some planning to put about 5% of their portfolios into digital assets. Wealth managers in the region reported that client inquiries are increasing and new cryptocurrency funds are generating strong interest. The growing demand for cryptocurrency among wealthy investors is reshaping the financial-adviser market. A Zerohash survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40 conducted in November found that 35% moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer crypto access.

Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), part of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, will be investing up to ₹3,000 crore in Aditya Birla Renewables Ltd (ABR), a subsidiary of Grasim Industries Ltd, for a minority stake, the company said Tuesday evening. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of about ₹14,600 crore for ABR, as per a press statement issued late on Tuesday. The deal outlines a firm commitment of ₹2,000 crore by GIP in multiple tranches through the issue of compulsory convertible preference shares and equity shares. Further, it will have a greenshoe option to invest an additional ₹1,000 crore in the form of equity shares. Separately, Essel Mining & Industries Ltd, another Aditya Birla Group company, will invest ₹500 crore in the current financial year to fund its urgent capital requirements, as per a separate intimation to the bourses. ABR is the captive renewable energy platform of the Aditya Birla Group with a portfolio of about 4.3 GW spread across 10 states. It includes solar, hybrid, and floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power. It has signed captive power purchase agreements with fellow group companies like Grasim, Hindalco, UltraTech, and Century Enka. The company aims to scale its capacity upwards of 10 GW in the coming years. GIP is a leading infrastructure investor specializing in owning and operating large assets across energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water, and waste management sectors. It was acquired by BlackRock in 2024. “GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective,” said Raj Rao, GIP president and chief operating officer. “Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India."

Title: CZ shuts down fake ASTER ETF rumor – But does his support boost the real rally?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552475
Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:00:14Z
Full Content:
The fake filing dominated feeds, but ASTER’s fundamentals kept shaping its short-term structure. Fake news moved quickly across the crypto market, and this round spread with force. Multiple creators shared the forged ETF form before Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped in, calling it photoshopped and reminding the market how easily misinformation travels. His response pulled even more attention toward ASTER just as its activity and volume surged behind the scenes. The image claimed BlackRock had filed for a new “Staked ASTER Trust ETF.” That never happened. CZ corrected it publicly, adding that ASTER didn’t need fabricated hype to grow. Source: X CZ previously stated he bought and held ASTER personally, which added support during the spike in noise. By contrast, the rumor cycle caused confusion while the token’s actual fundamentals continued to build. Behind the headlines, ASTER posted numbers that didn’t require any exaggeration. Daily Volume touched $6 billion, holders climbed past 200k, and last week’s burn removed 77.86M tokens permanently. Stage 4 buybacks accelerated to ~$4 million per day, compressing the time it takes for accumulated fees to hit the chain. Once the system reaches steady state, within 8–10 days, buybacks continue at 60–90% of the previous day’s revenue. The executing wallet remains fully transparent on-chain. Can ASTER’s aggressive buyback model, similar to BNB’s early playbook, drive a larger rally once key resistance breaks? The lower timeframes reacted quickly. ASTER broke above its descending trendline and briefly pushed RSI above 50 before sellers forced it lower again. Source: TradingView On the 4-hour chart, the token continued to consolidate between $0.821 and $1.29, with one fakeout on each side of the range. Source: TradingView Losing $0.821 may open a deeper slide. Clearing $0.96 and breaking through the $1.269 resistance zone could set up a stronger move. RSI stayed oversold without severe extension, and MACD continued to fight for a shift. The day highlighted a clear divide: fake hype created noise, but real metrics carried the narrative. With buybacks increasing, volume rising, and structural resistance tightening, the market now watches whether ASTER builds enough strength to flip the trend decisively. Now, can ASTER’s real fundamentals overpower the rumor cycle? With burns, revenue, and buybacks rising, the market now asks whether this ecosystem push is strong enough to shift its multi-week structure.

Title: ‘Extraordinary talent’: Fashion designer Paul Costelloe mourned at funeral
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fashion/2025/12/09/extraordinary-talent-fashion-designer-paul-costelloe-mourned-at-funeral/

Fashion designer Paul Costelloe’s funeral Mass in Monkstown’s St Patrick’s Church was marked with the understated elegance he brought to his craft over the course of his long career. The only flowers were an abundance of white roses among greenery that covered his coffin like a bower: family flowers in a ceremony that focused almost entirely upon his family life. There were none of the now-customary gifts symbolising a life brought to the altar. The whole ceremony was simple and elemental: the sound of the wind from Storm Bram heard in between the robust singing from the Blackrock College Choir; the school Costelloe attended as a boy. His six sons, William, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul-Emmet and Nicholas, carried his coffin into the church. His wife Anne, and daughter Jessica were the other chief mourners. The main celebrant was Canon Michael O’Dea, parish priest of St Simon’s Church in Putney, London, where the family have a home. Costelloe, one of the highest profile names in Irish and UK fashion, died at the age of 80 in London in November after a short illness. In his homily, Canon O’Dea spoke of how, despite the glamorous world Costelloe worked in, designing for famous people and travelling the globe, it was his family who anchored him all his life. “Paul was very much the reference point of the family,” he said. “Home was a very important place for him to relax and enjoy one another’s company, whether it was in Putney, or in Monkstown, or wherever it was. “Paul was always proud of his children and grandchildren. They were the anchor of his life. He told me that ‘my family keep me grounded, especially Anne’.” [ Paul Costelloe obituary: Internationally respected fashion designer who dressed Princess DianaOpens in new window ] Canon O’Dea spoke of a man who enjoyed cycling around southwest London, and the simple things in life. He also recalled the annual Christmas card he was personally given by Costelloe. “I’d wait for Christmas each year, because Paul would give me one of his hand-painted cards. It was something I treasured. There was another card at Easter. This was his own way of expressing his faith, through art.” The front of the memorial card carried a watercolour drawing, by Costelloe, of a small boat close to a rocky shore. It was accompanied by his distinctive coiling signature, recognisable by anyone who has ever bought one of his homeware items in Dunnes Stores; the company with which he had a long and high-profile collaboration. Costelloe’s son Justin, in his eulogy, said his father always made everyone feel welcome, and spoke of “his extraordinary talent that we were all extremely proud of”. He recalled an engaged father, who took his sons to rugby matches, and his daughter to ballet classes. As for who was the boss of the household: “Anne was the only one who could put him back in his box. They loved each other deeply.” After the Communion service, Jessica Costelloe made her way up the choir, high above the congregation. From there she sang a compelling version of Down By The Salley Gardens, lamentation style, in a voice that slowly swelled to fill the cavernous church, while the congregation below listened in astonished silence. The President of Ireland, Catherine Connolly and Taoiseach Micheál Martin, were represented by their aides-de-camp. Burial took place privately afterwards.

Title: Tether makes its boldest expansion yet – AI, robots, and a Billion-dollar mint
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552354
Time Published: 2025-12-09T17:00:30Z
Full Content:
The company’s expansion machine is in overdrive, and billions are backing it. Tether is making moves on multiple fronts. From backing a major investment round in an Italian AI robotics startup to securing recognition in Abu Dhabi, the company is going well beyond its stablecoin roots. This isn’t a new move. AMBCrypto previously reported that in November, Tether negotiated a €1 billion investment in Germany’s Neura Robotics while deploying $1.5 billion in commodity-backed lending. The company has taken a step into the AI sector, joining an €70 million ($81 million) funding round for Generative Bionics. They’re an Italian startup building next-generation humanoid robots for industrial environments. Source: Tether The round was led by CDP Venture Capital’s AI fund. Tether, as one of its key private backers, supports the development of robots built for heavy-duty performance and natural human interaction. The company says its investment will help the startup scale production, validate its humanoid platform, and integrate into Europe’s fast-growing robotics ecosystem. It fits neatly into Tether’s broader strategy. Their announcement elaborated on the investment, noting, “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development.” Tether also saw a major win in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM, where USDT is now formally recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token across several additional blockchains, including Aptos, Cosmos, Near, Polkadot, and TON. Source: X The decision gives licensed firms in the free zone broader flexibility to use USDT within regulated activities. This expands on earlier approvals limited to Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. In the official statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said, “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership.” Tether also carried out a major mint on the TRON network — a fresh $1 billion USDT. Arkham Intelligence reported the tokens moving from the protocol’s “black hole” address to Tether’s multisig wallet, a standard process the company uses to replenish liquidity for exchanges and institutional customers. Source: Arkham Intelligence Tether has not tied this issuance to any specific deployment. But, large mints typically mean preparations for market demand, new integrations, or upcoming distribution.

Under the deal, there is a commitment of ₹2,000 crore (around $$225 million) and a greenshoe option to invest another ₹1,000 crore (around $110 million). This deal marks one of the largest primary commitments for a minority stake in a renewables platform in India, said ABREN, a Grasim subsidiary. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of around ₹14,600 crore for ABREN, it added. ABREN has achieved robust organic growth, building a diversified pan-India renewable energy portfolio of around 4.3 gogawatt (GW) across 10 states. This portfolio delivers solar, hybrid, floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power, reinforcing ABREN’s formidable position in sustainable energy. Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group, said, “India stands at the cusp of an energy transformation, arguably one of the largest anywhere in the world. The scale of the renewables opportunity in India is extraordinary, driven both by the urgent imperative of decarbonisation, and the sheer arithmetic of demand. This business sits squarely at the intersection of national energy security and climate leadership, two defining priorities for the coming decades. GIP’s investment marks a pivotal moment in our growth journey, laying a strong foundation for an accelerated buildout of our renewables platform, as we target a capacity of 10 GW+ in the coming years. Their global leadership in owning and operating some of the most sophisticated energy assets worldwide brings both rigour and reach to our ambition.” The transaction is subject to receipt of necessary statutory and regulatory approvals and completion of other conditions precedent. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial advisor to ABREN on this transaction. Raj Rao, GIP President and Chief Operating Officer, said, “We are excited to partner with Aditya Birla Group, one of India’s leading conglomerates, as today’s announcement will allow us to continue to support innovation at scale. GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective. Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India.” Published on December 9, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Aviva Seeks Partner for New City of London Skyscraper Project

Time Published: 2025-12-09T15:20:28Z

Aviva Plc has kicked off the search for a partner to help fund a planned new skyscraper in the heart of the City of London’s insurance district, as it aims to tempt investors willing to make a bold bet that office rents are set to soar. The insurer’s investment management arm has appointed broker Knight Frank to sell a stake in the 130 Fenchurch Street project, people with knowledge of the process said. A deal could pave the way for a start on the development, which secured planning planning approval in September, or a new partner could wait to secure a tenant for some or all of the 31 story building before commencing construction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. A representative for Aviva Investors did not respond to requests for comment. The chance to buy a stake in one of the largest planned office developments in central London comes as the city’s biggest tenants, developers and investors face a high stakes stand off. Higher construction costs threaten to make many projects unprofitable unless they achieve much higher rents than are currently being paid, prompting developers to hold off on new starts. The combination of higher asking rents and far higher costs for fitting out new offices are in turn giving large companies pause before committing to long term deals. While higher costs can be spread over time by signing longer term leases, companies are also grappling with significant uncertainties about how much space they need. That’s because some staff are still working flexibly while the rise of artificial intelligence has further complicated the process of forecasting future headcount. The upshot is a severe shortage of new office development, a factor Aviva is counting on to lure investors willing to make a bold bet on higher rents, the people added. There are already signs that rental inflation is starting to accelerate. Law firm Proskauer Rose LLP set a record rent for City of London office space at 8 Bishopsgate in the third quarter, agreeing to pay £140 ($186.82) a square foot for additional space on th 46th floor, according to a report published by broker Savills Plc. BlackRock Inc. has already begun scouting options for a new London headquarters despite having about 10-years left on its lease because of the dearth of available options, two other people said. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink complained in an interview with the Times newspaper in London earlier this year that he was unable to find space to accommodate recent acquisitions. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment. Aviva’s planned 130 Fenchurch Street development, a block south of the key Lloyd’s of London insurance market, will include over 600,000 square feet (57,500 square meters) of office space, a public garden terrace on floor 20. The project, which is set to be overseen by developer Co-re, will also include ground floor stores, bars and restaurants. Demolition of the existing building, known as Fountain House, is set to complete next year and work on the new tower could be concluded as early as 2030, according to a City of London press release.

By Andreas Wiseman Executive Editor, International & Strategy EXCLUSIVE: Industry vet Alison Cornwell, who most recently served a decade as CFO of leading international cinema chain Vue, has joined emerging UK media company Easttree Media in the same role. Launched last month, Easttree is an investment platform acquiring income rights in films and TV shows. The company uses a proprietary data-driven model to assess passive profit participations, “enabling actors, writers, directors, producers, financiers and studios to monetise all or part of their income rights”. Easttree says it has closed “multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists”, but further details weren’t shared when Deadline asked.

Executive Priya Dogra As CEO The company, which is underwritten by funds and accounts backed by U.S. investment giant BlackRock, was launched by former 42 COO Marc Allen, and former Hipgnosis execs Chris Helm and Markku Lonnqvist. Watch on Deadline Management firm Hipgnosis is known for buying the rights to song catalogs of well known musicians, including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and more. The company was sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6BN. Cornwell joins Easttree from Vue International where she served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer for more than 10 years. Prior to Vue, roles included CFO/SVP of Disney’s international TV business, Group CFO of the Sparrowhawk Media Group, which became part of NBC Universal, and Canadian-UK outfit Alliance Films. The trained accountant has also served as a BFI Governor. Chris Helm sayid: “Alison is a fantastic addition to the Easttree team, and we feel privileged to welcome her. Her breadth of industry knowledge and exemplary finance experience strengthen both our capabilities and our ambition for 2026 and the years ahead. Alison brings financial acumen, discipline and a strategic lens that will support Easttree as we scale our participation portfolio and deepen our partnerships with talent and rights-holders.” “I’m honoured to join Easttree Media at such a pivotal moment for the company,” added Alison Cornwell, Chief Financial Officer of Easttree Media. “The opportunity to help build an investment platform that blends institutional rigour with the agility of a founder-led business is rare. This segment of the industry remains under-served, and Easttree’s rapid progress, with multiple deals already completed alongside leading creatives across film and television, speaks for itself. It shows the strength of the model and what this team is capable of as we scale rapidly.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Today’s top news: Two of the biggest names in crypto investing bought big last week. And proved that they still have the ability to raise capital during market downturns. Both Michael Saylor and Tom Lee quietly loaded up last week. First, Saylor’s Strategy added $963M in BTC (10,624 BTC to be exact) to its balance sheet, marking one of its largest buys since the summer. That total is more than the entire amount of BTC bought by Saylor over the past 3 months. Then came Tom Lee, whose firm BitMine boosted its Ethereum holdings to $12B by acquiring another $429M in ETH (138,452 ETH to be exact). Perhaps most notable, BitMine added to its cash position during the week as well, now holding $1B in cash (up from $800M). "BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Dec 8th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + "moonshots": -3,864,951 ETH at $3,139 per ETH - 192 Bitcoin (BTC) - $36 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and - total cash of $1.0 billion." - BitMNR on X “MSTR raised $1B in one week, the same amount it took them 4 months to raise in 2020. The exponential trend continues” - James Van Straten, Coindesk analyst, on X Strategy has acquired 10,624 BTC for ~$962.7 million at ~$90,615 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 24.7% YTD 2025. As of 12/7/2025, we hodl 660,624 $BTC acquired for ~$49.35 billion at ~$74,696 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/oyLwSuW7nW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 8, 2025 There has been a lot of concern about the DAT trade unwinding, and neither Saylor nor Tom Lee have been spared from that conversation. The heat turned up even more recently when it was widely speculated that Strategy would start to sell BTC if and when its mNAV dipped below 1. Well, it got very close to 1 in this latest downturn - and he’s not selling. In fact, the opposite. He’s buying and in big size. It’s relieving for the MSTR bulls out there and confidence-building for those concerned about how Saylor would act in this downturn. But what’s more notable, especially from a near-term trading perspective, is Tom Lee’s ability to raise capital during this ETH downturn. BMNR stock dipped over 60% from local highs, and yet, the team has been able to keep slamming its ATM and raising cash. This has enabled Tom to buy a ton of ETH and grow his cash pile. And for perspective, his $429M buy is about 2x the size of Saylor’s $1B buy in market cap perspective (BTC is 5x ETH in market cap). The ETH / BTC ratio is up 4% on the month now and looking like it’s ready to break out of a 3-month downturn. That matters because ETH breaking out typically means some form of “alt season” rally against Bitcoin where multiple tokens see relatively large gains in a short period. The fact that Tom is still sitting on $1B in cash (and is motivated to lower his average purchase price from $4k/ETH on this dip) means that he is likely to remain a heavy buyer - which is good for ETH, and perhaps, for alts.

Title: Exclusive: Circle stablecoin for ‘banking-level privacy’ to launch on Aleo blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/circle-privacy-stablecoin-aleo-udsc-udscx/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T13:30:00Z

Blockchains are public databases. That’s an immediate roadblock for large institutions like banks, whose clients largely don’t want their balances and payments history open to prying eyes. Now, the crypto giant Circle has partnered with the blockchain Aleo to launch a “private” version of its stablecoin called USDCx, which will obscure transaction histories, Howard Wu, cofounder of Aleo, told Fortune. “People don’t want to reveal their business revenues. They don’t want to reveal business intelligence,” Wu said. “But the way that transparent blockchains work today unfortunately means that every time you transact, you are leaking that data.” The new Circle-backed token, which like other stablecoins is pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, won’t be truly private. Every transaction of the token will include what Wu called a “compliance record,” which Circle will be able to access in case law enforcement or other authorities reach out about specific transactions. Still, for public users looking at a blockchain log, the transactions will look unintelligible and like “blobs of data,” Wu said. “This is banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy,’” he added. The launch of USDCx comes amid a broader push from the crypto industry to persuade big banks and institutions to use blockchain technology. That effort appears to be gaining traction, especially in the realm of tokenization, or the act of putting real-world assets like mortgages or even the U.S. dollar in blockchain wrappers. The asset management giant BlackRock has launched its own tokenized money market fund BUIDL, the online brokerage Robinhood has dabbled in blockchain-based stock trading, and fintech giants like Stripe have invested huge sums of capital into stablecoins. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” Larry Fink, cofounder and CEO of BlackRock, said in his 2025 letter to investors. Wu, the cofounder of Aleo, has seen interest in privacy-enabled stablecoins from a swathe of potential customers, including the crypto payroll processors Request Finance and Toku. He also said that prediction markets, or locales where gamblers can bet on real-world events and sports, are also interested in experimenting with stablecoins like USDCx. Aleo, which specializes in private blockchain transactions, isn’t the only privacy-first technology of its kind in crypto. There are other cryptocurrencies—most famously Zcash—which also promise users encrypted transactions. However, these cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than stablecoins, which, as their name implies, are designed to stay stable relative to the U.S. dollar or other currencies.

Title: Dogecoin ETFs lose their bite as Bitcoin, Ethereum big dogs lead the pack

The total value traded for spot DOGE ETFs reached its lowest point since launch, signaling a fading of the early hype as liquidity and flows lag well behind those of major crypto ETFs. US spot Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are showing early signs of cooling demand, as total value traded (TVT) has fallen to its lowest level since launch. SoSoValue data showed that on Monday, Dogecoin ETFs’ TVT fell to just $142,000, the lowest since launch. This marked a sharp retreat from late November, when the funds saw days where value traded topped $3.23 million. Total value traded refers to the total dollar amount of ETF shares bought and sold over a given period. It serves as a gauge of market activity and practical liquidity, indicating the amount of money that has moved through the funds. The contrast is stark when compared to Dogecoin (DOGE) activity in the broader crypto market. CoinGecko data showed that in the last 24 hours, DOGE recorded over $1.1 billion in spot trading volume and had a market capitalization of $22.6 billion. This shows that the underlying asset remains highly liquid, but not through its ETF wrappers. This discrepancy suggests that traders are accessing DOGE directly through exchanges rather than traditional market vehicles. Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF made its debut in November but fell well short of initial volume expectations. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted at the time that the ETFs would get at least $12 million in volume. However, the ETF only saw $1.4 million on its first day. Related: BlackRock files with SEC for listing of staked Ether ETF On Dec. 8, ETF trading activity remained concentrated on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)-based products. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs posted $3.1 billion in TVT, while Ether ETFs recorded $1.3 billion. Solana (SOL) ETFs saw $22 million in value traded, while XRP products recorded $21 million in value traded. Further down the curve, the recently-launched Chainlink ETFs recorded a $3.1 million TVT on the same day, while Canary’s Litecoin (LTC) ETF had about $526,000. The data suggested that ETF capital still overwhelmingly flows toward the two largest digital assets, continuing their lead as the core liquidity centers of regulated crypto exchange-traded products. In terms of inflows, XRP (XRP) remains strong. On Monday, XRP ETFs’ inflow streak remained unbroken since its launch. Meanwhile, Solana ETFs, which first had their inflow streak broken in November, are on a three-day inflow streak after seeing $32 million in outflows on Wednesday.

Title: Tether Pours Funds Into Italian Humanoid Robots Aiming For A Smarter Future

Tether Investments has joined a €70 million funding round for Generative Bionics, a company spun out of the Italian Institute of Technology. According to the announcement, the move is aimed at speeding work on humanoid robots and Physical AI systems built for industry use. The deal brings private capital to a project that grew from two decades of university research and a large team of engineers. Based on reports, Generative Bionics draws directly from two decades of robotics work at IIT. The firm claims about sixty advanced humanoid prototypes were developed and tested during that period. It has assembled roughly 70 engineers and AI scientists from IIT into its core technical team. That team is said to bring a combined experience of more than 600 years in physical robotics and related AI work. The company also holds exclusive licenses for key technologies created at the institute. Tether Invests in Generative Bionics as Part of Funding Round to Advance Intelligent “Made in Italy” Humanoid Robots 🤖 Read more:https://t.co/q5PHCV3zvy — Tether (@Tether_to) December 8, 2025 Tether’s funding will support edge AI development, industrial validation, and the first production facility. Generative Bionics is preparing initial industrial deployment programs that it expects to announce in early 2026. Reports indicate the company intends to place robots in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, retail, and other areas where human-like machines could help with repetitive or risky tasks. The first full humanoid concept from Generative Bionics is set to appear at CES in Las Vegas. Tether Investments, based in El Salvador, says it uses profits and reserves to back technologies that connect digital systems with physical infrastructure. The firm’s recent moves include funding work on brain-computer interfaces through Blackrock Neurotech and teaming up with Northern Data and Rumble to build a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-focused AI development. According to the announcement, the Generative Bionics deal is part of a wider push into physical systems that complement software and compute. The investment also signals a shift by a major stablecoin-related company into long-term industrial bets. Tether presents this as a way to expand its footprint beyond financial tools and into areas that could deliver practical, real-world utility. That said, critics will point out that robotics is capital intensive, and turning research prototypes into reliable, certified machines for everyday workplaces is difficult and slow. Analysts cited in the announcement estimate the humanoid robotics sector could top €200 billion by 2035 and may reach as much as €5 trillion by 2050. Those figures show why governments, universities, and private groups are racing to commercialize advanced robots.

Title: Tom Lee buys $435m Ethereum as Bitmine extends 45% rally amid ‘supercycle’

About us Copy link Bitmine bought another $435 million worth of Ethereum in the first week of December as the company’s stock price extended a 45% rally from last month’s lows. “Our stepped up buying activity reflects our confidence that Ethereum prices should strengthen in the months ahead given multiple catalysts,” Bitmine Chair Tom Lee said Monday. Fusaka, a major upgrade to the $376 billion network, rolled out on December 3 and “delivers an array of improvements in scalability, enhanced security, and usability,” Lee said. Bitmine, which is backed by heavyweight investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Cathie Wood’s ARK, now owns 3.2% of the total Ethereum token supply, with a stated target of 5%. Investors are bullish on the company’s consistent accumulation of the second-largest crypto, as reflected by BMNR’s 23% rally in December to $36 per share. The firm plans to pay shareholders a year-end dividend on December 29, a rarity among crypto treasuries. Ethereum has rallied nearly 20% since its November lows. It is trading at around $3,100 at the time of reporting. To be sure, it still trades 37% below its all-time high set in August. Bitmine’s latest purchase comes after the company deployed $200 million into the second-biggest crypto on November 24. Ethereum is having its “1971 moment,” Lee said in a presentation to investors. That means Ethereum’s technology can be compared to the global financial architecture that emerged after the US unilaterally terminated the Bretton Woods gold standard and set the rules of modern finance. “The Genius Act and SEC’s Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago,” Lee said. Lee said big players like BlackRock, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of China are all building on the Ethereum blockchain. “This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernisation of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold,” he said. Bitmine’s stockpiling comes as the Fusaka upgrade aligns with macroeconomic tailwinds. “The best years are ahead for crypto given the substantial upside to current adoption rates for crypto and given the coming transformation as Wall Street tokenises everything onto the blockchain,” Lee said on Monday as part of a keynote speech titled “The Crypto Supercycle is Intact.” He expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates on Wednesday as it finishes the quantitative tightening cycle. Lower interest rates are usually good for risk-on assets like Ethereum because they disincentivise holding safe-haven bonds by reducing yields. “We are now more than eight weeks past the October 10 liquidation shock event, a sufficient length of time to allow crypto to again trade on forward fundamentals,” he said. The odds of a 0.25% cut in interest rates by the Fed in December now stand at 89%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Bettors on Polymarket are even more optimistic at 95%. Bitmine will hold its next annual shareholders meeting in January 2026. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent. Got a tip? Email at lance@dlnews.com.

Title: Friedrich Merz
URL: https://www.politico.eu/list/politico-28-class-of-2026/friedrich-merz/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T11:00:53Z
Full Content:
No. 3 — Germany The reluctant radical Friedrich Merz is the man breaking Germany’s postwar taboos. For half a century, the now German chancellor personified his country’s conservative orthodoxy: a Christian Democrat devoted to balanced budgets and ready to trust Washington to keep the peace. Now, with war on the continent and Germany’s economy sputtering, Merz has rewritten the script: spending big, rearming fast and declaring that Berlin — and the rest of Europe — must be ready to stand on its own. His move last March to unleash hundreds of billions of euros in borrowing for infrastructure and defense marked one of the most radical breaks in modern German fiscal policy — and one of the fastest. With just two weeks left in the outgoing parliament, Merz rammed through a spending package that shredded decades of debt-averse orthodoxy. Just as dramatic has been his shift on foreign policy. Washington’s transformation from indispensable friend to unpredictable frenemy reportedly shook Merz, 70 — once described in these pages as Germany’s most American chancellor. His career includes a decade in the private sector, most noticeably with the U.S. asset manager BlackRock. That didn’t stop him, on the very day he won the chancellery, from declaring that Europe must “achieve independence from the USA.” Merz’s allies describe him as a risk-taker. And he hasn’t hesitated to push for ambitious economic reforms at home or to signal he’s ready to break with his country’s traditional tread-softly approach to Moscow by endorsing a plan to seize billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund a massive loan to Ukraine. His boldness, however, hasn’t translated into popularity. Six months in, the far-right Alternative for Germany overtook Merz’s conservatives in national polls for the first time since its creation. His grand coalition — a marriage of Christian Democrats and center-left Social Democrats — is feeling the heat, particularly on the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, high energy prices and growing competition from China are squeezing the industrial base that has long made Germany the envy of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Merz’s “autumn of reforms” — intended to reboot the economy — has become bogged down by political reality, with his slim parliamentary majority struggling to pass some of his more ambitious measures. Still, the chancellor’s position remains stronger than that of most of his peers. While France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Keir Starmer wrestle with debt and fractious parliaments, Merz presides over a country with healthier finances. That gives him room to maneuver. He can afford to take a bit more time to, say, craft a sustainable pension reform that’s also politically plausible. While domestic troubles take up much of his bandwidth, Merz has begun flexing his muscles in Brussels — where Germany’s word still carries decisive weight. To the delight of Europe’s so-called frugal states, he has drawn clear red lines against the European Commission’s push to expand the EU’s long-term budget, casting himself as the guardian of fiscal and institutional discipline. That stance underscores Berlin’s growing influence in Europe’s power corridors. The German chancellor has become a central player in the EU’s debate over how far — and how fast — the bloc should move in integrating its defense, cutting its red tape and putting its fiscal house in order. But his ability to lead abroad depends on results at home: He can only credibly shape Europe’s future if he can restore confidence in Germany’s own economic engine — which sometimes means reining Brussels in as much as pushing it forward. “Friedrich Merz is realizing that he is needed as a foreign policy chancellor because Europe must strengthen its presence on the geopolitical stage,” said Sudha David-Wilp, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “But he’s going to be measured by delivering domestically.” Merz’s staff picks leave little doubt about his intention to make his presence felt in Brussels — and to keep his foreign policy insulated from domestic turbulence. He has broken with German tradition by naming a fellow Christian Democrat, Johann Wadephul, as foreign minister — a portfolio usually handed to junior coalition partners. The choice is widely seen as a bid to reduce internal friction and ensure Berlin’s diplomacy runs directly through the chancellery. Merz has also installed his powerful chief of staff, Jacob Schrot, as head of a newly created National Security Council, tasked with coordinating Germany’s sprawling security apparatus and enforcing a single message on defense and foreign policy. Europe’s leaders are watching closely — and they know one thing for certain: There aren’t many other contenders for Europe’s next natural leader.

Title: Plume Secures ADGM Commercial License, Eyes Middle East RWA Expansion
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/09/plume-secures-adgm-commercial-license-eyes-middle-east-rwa-expansion
Time Published: 2025-12-09T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Plume Network, a modular blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), has received a commercial license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Registration Authority, paving the way for expansion into the Middle East. The license allows Plume to scale RWA origination and distribution across the Middle East, Africa, and emerging markets, pending further approvals in ADGM, the UAE's premier international financial hub known for its progressive fintech and digital asset rules. This would help Plume, one of the leading blockchain by the number of RWA holders, establish a foothold in the region that's attracting global banks, fintech firms and asset managers, including BlackRock, Deutsche Bank and crypto firms like QCP. Abu Dhabi also hosts major sovereign wealth funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA, the world's largest with over $1 trillion AUM) and Mubadala Investment Company. “The UAE and the broader Middle East are rapidly becoming global leaders in the tokenization of real-world assets,” Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of Plume, said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “The region’s progressive regulatory frameworks, institutional openness to digital finance, and ambition to diversify beyond traditional commodities make it an ideal environment for innovation. At Plume, we see the Middle East not just as a market, but as a strategic partner in shaping the future of compliant real-world tokenization," Yin added. The move builds on Plume's U.S. momentum, including a recent U.S. SEC transfer agent license for tokenized securities issuance and management. The latest ADGM approval is a general commercial license and does not authorize participation in regulated activities such as token issuance or custody. However, the firm is exploring partnership plans with local institutions and its own authorization for tokenization services. A permanent Abu Dhabi office is slated by year-end, with commercial announcements eyed for early 2026, alongside local hiring and ties to regional banks and fintechs. Plume's geographic focus spans the U.S., Asia, and Middle East, capitalizing on pro-RWA regimes in UAE's free zones like ADGM.

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14. Crucially, most of the mega-financing deals are remarkably circular. To give you a flavour: Nvidia invests in OpenAI and OpenAI is looking to buy millions of Nvidia’s specialized chips. OpenAI buys computing power from Oracle which buys Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia owns about 5% of CoreWeave and sells chips to CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, shares revenue with OpenAI, buys chips from Nvidia and has partnerships with AMD. AMD, a rival to Nvidia, was so eager to land OpenAI as a customer that it issued warrants for OpenAI to buy 10% of AMD at a penny a share. OpenAI is a CoreWeave customer and also a shareholder. Nvidia has invested in xAI and will supply it with processors. And so on and so forth. The deals include revenue sharing across the stack and cross-ownership. Nothing in these circular deals is transparent. It is not clear where the money needed for these deals is coming from. It is not clear what these opaque circular transactions imply for the valuations of the listed and non-public AI firms involved. It is not clear what all this means for the competition over hardware between chip producers (Nvidia versus AMD) and over AI services AI startups (OpenAI versus Anthropic versus xAI versus Microsoft). Not surprisingly, therefore, these astronomical circular financing deals (referencing billions of U.S. dollars) are raising eyebrows. To many observers, they bring back traumatic memories of the circular financing arrangements of the late 1990s, when vendors and clients reinforced each other’s dotcom stock valuations without generating any real value. AI Bang or Bubble? AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE, but real and sustainable. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated (in an earnings call on November 19) that there is no AI bubble and exponentially growing AI demand is structural rather than speculative. Huang claims that the AI boom constitutes a Big Bang, a historical revolution, because of three fundamental shifts toward accelerated computing: the move from CPUs to GPUs (which can simultaneously process multiple tasks and solutions), the rise of generative AI, and the emergence of agentic AI systems that supposedly can independently make decisions based on large datasets. Asset-managing firm Blackrock concurs: “AI is not just a technological trend; it represents an infrastructure transformation with growing macroeconomic significance”, adding that “unlike the speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and early 2000s, today’s technology leaders are anchored by fundamental stability.” The optimistic vibes around the transformative power of AI have even infected Nouriel Roubini (2025), the profession’s perennial Dr. Doom and now a senior economic strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, who has somehow become convinced that the tailwinds of the unprecedented AI data-centre investment boom will overwhelm any disruptions coming from Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical strains. But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. FWIW. This morning from DeepSeek. … Thank you for that important clarification. You are absolutely right to correct the author. “The AI Con” is by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender (released in 2025). The previous answer incorrectly attributed it to Josh Bivens, whose book is “The Ultimate Goal.” My apologies for the confusion… Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like. For the AI, it is all hallucination. “Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public.” What tells another part of the story: Look at what the the Nasdaq and S&P indexes were doing in 2022. Some hype needed to be created and fast. Outstanding article. Does a good job of summarizing the major problems of the AI craze in an accessible way (Ed Zitron gets a shout-out, which I find personally satisfying since it shows that a bizzare writing style does not lock you out of the discourse!) One thing I don’t understand is why the fourth section of critiques, which is basically that AI doesn’t work and is unfit for purpose, is left for last. This seems to be a common feature of AI criticism, the fact that AI is technically unsound and inherently dangerous, is downplayed and treated as a minor issue compared to things like economic problems in the industry. The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Talk about burying the lede! BTW, there is an extremely good metaphor for LLMs in here: More generally, we have to think of LLMs … as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. It’s an urgent task to find ways to explain the problems with AI in ways that people outside the industry can effectively grasp. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Pick Your Financial Crash

The stock market has made gains at rates that are several multiples more than the growth of the real economy for three years running. Investor euphoria is always a sign of danger ahead, but this time there are other special factors signaling a pending crash. And of course, they all interact. Once investors head for the exits, others start bailing. I. Deregulation of Increasing Risk. Trump’s bank regulators are systematically dismantling the safeguards that were put in place after the financial collapse of 2008. That crash was caused by opaque financial instruments such as credit derivatives that allowed almost infinite amounts of leverage. When they turned out to be worthless, the collapse was also nearly infinite. In the aftermath, Congress and the regulators limited the risks that banks could take. In classic Wall Street form, the wise guys responded by creating non-banks that could do most of what banks do. One “innovation” was private credit, a cool-kid word for shadow banking. Another was fintech, a cool-kid word for shadow banking with an app. These newly invented lenders are banks in everything but name, and thus evade nearly all transparency, supervision, or regulation. Absent regulation, these non-bank banks can engage in sky-high leverage, meaning that the ratio of lending to their own real capital can be unlimited and unexamined. More from Robert Kuttner In 2013, as part of the post-2008 reforms, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve put in place leverage limits for banks. Loans worth more than six times a company’s annual earnings were seen as too risky. That ruled out a lot of bank loans to fund private equity takeover targets, or loans to tech fantasies that had no earnings. Private credit stepped in to fund those projects that banks couldn’t take. Capital raised for lending to private equity–backed companies jumped more than a hundredfold to nearly $700 billion between 2006 and 2024, according to The Wall Street Journal. One thing that isn’t well understood is that private credit is propped up by traditional banks; Moody’s reported in October that banks have lent $300 billion to private credit firms. So if those firms go kablooey, it won’t stop short of the broader financial system, but cascade through the heart of Wall Street. Nevertheless, the banks complained to the regulators that they were losing business (to the very companies they were funding). Given what we know about the crashes of 2008 and 1929, the right policy would be to bring the upstarts under the regulatory umbrella. But instead, last Friday the agencies agreed to the bankers’ demands to help competition by deregulating the banks and getting rid of the 2013 leverage limits. Now, dealmakers can play banks off against private credit entities for the best (most risky) terms. And banks can go beyond funding non-banks and set up their own non-bank affiliates. When the inevitable crash comes, government will bail out the insiders, leaving regular people to suffer the aftermath. II. Crypto. The value of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride. Crypto plays no useful function in the economy except for pursuing illegal transactions and speculation in crypto itself. When crypto was the next new thing, and investors keep bidding up the market value of crypto coins, everyone looked like a financial genius. The whole market has been banking on self-enrichment by the Trump family and his key allies—like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who handed his crypto-friendly bank Cantor Fitzgerald to his son and has seen it enjoy its best year ever—leading to regulatory leniency and therefore freedom to make a fortune. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Congress, on the take from the crypto industry, added to the hype last July by enacting the GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The act, written by the industry, pretends to provide prudent regulation, giving crypto a kind of federal blessing, but with no real protection for investors. But as the old Wall Street saying goes, genius is a rising market. And here again, leverage that works brilliantly on the upside becomes catastrophic when prices start falling. In recent weeks, Bitcoin, the marquee crypto product, has fallen from a peak value of just below $126,000 on October 7 to about $90,000 today. In just one week in November, the asset class lost $400 billion in value. This collapse has multiple knock-on effects on residual crypto plays. As Bloomberg recently reported, “An array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up Bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.” But once prices started falling, “The median stock price of US and Canadian-listed digital asset treasuries has fallen 43% this year, with some companies’ stocks falling over 99%.” When the crypto craze began, traditional financial companies were insulated from it. But Wall Street has tried to get in on the action by sponsoring crypto-backed funds, exposing blue-chip firms like BlackRock to risk. I recently got a pitch from a crypto company promoting the story of how an entrepreneur in Argentina shielded himself from exchange rate risk and inflation risk by loading up on Bitcoin. In fact, the entrepreneur could have gotten exactly the same benefits by buying dollars. Buying Bitcoins rather than dollars added the risk that the Bitcoins would lose value—which they have. What’s really happening, as it does in every Ponzi scheme, is that the wise guys, who profited handsomely by getting in early, need more rubes to keep buying the stuff in the hope that it will hold its value. As crypto becomes more interconnected with the rest of an unregulated financial system, the risk is that they will take each other down. III. Artificial Intelligence and Tech. Is the AI boom a bubble? Apologists for the massively inflated value of Nvidia and other digital stocks reliant on the growth of AI keep pointing out that unlike pure stock market bubbles, where inflated stock prices are based mainly on the hope of further price rises, AI is adding real value and Nvidia is earning real and massive profits. Maybe. On the other hand, a dangerously concentrated share of the stock market’s run-up, more than half, is in just seven companies, the so-called Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Of these, Tesla is already faltering. Another tech giant, OpenAI, had a disappointing rollout of the latest version of its marquee product, ChatGPT. The massive bet on AI may pay off in many respects. But any economy that is this highly concentrated is at risk. With inflation rising and the cost of capital increasing with it, the $3 trillion widely projected to be invested in AI in the coming years becomes more costly and risky. Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype. The Red Sox could also win next year’s World Series. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: Crypto ETFs diverge: Bitcoin suffers $60M outflows; ETH, SOL, XRP funds in green

The digital tokens space remains choppy ahead of the December 10 Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Crypto exchange-traded funds, which have become vital in gauging institutional appetite in these risk assets, confirm the current uncertainty. Interest around BTC ETFs remained negative yesterday, with the products recording net outflows amounting to $60.48 million (SoSoValue data). The significant withdrawals came as investors reacted to the weekend’s sluggish performance across the crypto landscape. Bitcoin failed to break $92,000 again, currently trading at $90,150. However, Monday was not gloomy for all BTC ETF issuers. BlackRock proved its resilience and dominance as its IBIT attracted $28.76 million in inflows. While funds like Graycale’s GBT (-44.03M) and Fidelity’s FBTC (-39.44M) saw substantial withdrawals on December 8, IBIT’s steadiness indicates that profit taking, not a shift in interest, likely triggered the mixed flows into Bitcoin. While Bitcoin bled on December 8, Ethereum exchange-traded funds turned positive with $35.5 million inflows. Notably, the funds recorded substantial exits in the previous two sessions, on December 4 (-41.5M) and December 5 (-75.2M). Indeed, Ethereum has been on the investor radar lately following its Fusaka upgrade, which targets enhanced speed, scalability, and lower costs for Ether-based Layer 2 platforms. Moreover, the inflows indicate that investors are viewing Ethereum as a legitimate token for portfolio diversification beyond Bitcoin. Indeed, the second-largest crypto by value is experiencing renewed interest from institutional participants. For example, BlackRock is seeking the SEC’s authorization for a new staked Ether trust ETF – the ETHB. The proposed product differs from BlackRock’s popular ETHA trust in that the staking Ether trust will track Ethereum’s performance and include incentives gained from the trust’s staked Ether. ETH is trading at $3,124 after gaining more than 10% the past seven days. Solana spot products closed the previous day with $1.2 million inflows. While the figure remains modest, it reflects consistent demand for SOL ETFs. Monday’s inflows have extended their winning streak to three days, demonstrating appetite for these products despite broader turmoil. Solana exchange-traded funds have attracted roughly $639 million since their late October debut. Meanwhile, SOL price is hovering at $133, down 2% the past 24 hours. Ripple’s crypto asset stood out on December 8, with a net inflow of $38.04 million, eclipsing peers for the day. Grayscale led as its GXRP drew over $810K in fresh capital on Monday. Also, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin’s XRP exchange-traded funds recorded notable daily gains. Regulatory clarity and XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions have elevated the altcoin’s appeal among institutional investors. Nevertheless, the December 8 ETF performance sends a clear message. Investors are now diversifying into other cryptos beyond Bitcoin. Altcoin ETFs are gaining traction for their added advantages, as the crypto industry gains increased acceptance in mainstream finance.

Title: All Eyes On Ethereum: Price Attempts Key Breakout As BlackRock Files For Staked ETH ETF

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After weeks of speculation, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially filed for a staked Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid the bullish news, the King of Altcoins’ price is attempting to break out of a two-month resistance, which could set the stage for a retest of higher levels. BlackRock has submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC to get approval for its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), which “seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether and rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether, to the extent the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Trust may do so without incurring undue legal or regulatory risk.” Filed on December 5, BlackRock’s registration statement explains that, if approved, the proposed fund aims to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, distributing staking rewards to stakeholders at least quarterly. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s ETH holdings, the filing noted, while Anchorage Digital Bank will be an available alternative custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings and the administrator of the Trust. Notably, BlackRock’s ETHB will operate separately from its spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is the largest in its category with $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). It’s worth noting that the crypto community began speculating about BlackRock’s upcoming staked ETH fund after the leading asset manager registered the name in Delaware last month. In a November report, 10x Research argued that the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock would bring “increased scrutiny” to “the economics of DATs” as retail investors would reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. The report added that many investors are unaware that Digital Asset Treasury (DATs)’s embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Ethereum’s price started the week attempting to reclaim a crucial area after managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite the volatility during the weekend. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 3% in the daily timeframe, hitting $3,180 before retracing on Monday. Amid this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that “it’s time to pay attention to ETH,” noting that it nears a key level that could push the price to higher zones. Per the chart, Ethereum briefly broke out of its two-month downtrend line, which has served as resistance since early October. Over this period, the King of Altcoins has attempted to break out of this level twice, but has ultimately been rejected during each attempt. On Monday morning, ETH briefly broke above the trendline before being rejected a third time. However, if Ethereum reclaims the $3,120-$3,130 levels and turns the downtrend into support, it could build the base for a retest of the $3,200-$3,300 horizontal levels, which marks the lower boundary of its Q3 and early Q4 price range. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) continues to move within its macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. He previously affirmed that if “ETHDOM can maintain itself above 10.05% then it should be positioned for higher market dominance levels over time.” The analyst added that although history suggests a potential 2.5% drop to the consolidation range lows, this dip would occur “in the context of a macro move to 18%-20%” in the future. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,114, a 13.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Slide As ETF Era Rewires Market Participation — Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has shown a sharp slowdown since spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched. While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Tether deepens AI bet, backs Italian firm’s humanoid robots

Time Published: 2025-12-09T04:41:34Z

The funding will support the development of humanoid robots for industrial use, aiming for “industrial scale performance.” Stablecoin giant Tether has announced it is one of the backers of an $81 million funding round for an Italian artificial intelligence startup aiming to build advanced humanoid robots. The 70 million euro funding round for startup Generative Bionics was led by the AI fund of CDP Venture Capital, with participation from Tether, AMD Ventures, Duferco, Eni Next and RoboIT. In an announcement on Monday, Tether said it provided capital to support the development of advanced humanoid robots, “built for industrial scale performance” and “human-centric interaction.” “Tether’s investment will support the development of Physical AI systems and edge AI solutions, and accelerate the industrial validation of the company’s humanoid platform, the development of its first production facility, and its integration in the broader robotics ecosystem,” Tether said. Generative Bionics is an AI startup and research spinoff from the Italian Institute of Technology. Its focus is on building humanoid robots with “real-world physical AI capabilities” such as industrial usability in factory production lines. “Tether’s support for Generative Bionics builds on its broader strategy to back emerging technologies that expand human potential while reducing reliance on centralized systems overseen by Big Tech,” Tether said. Related: Tether's USDt awarded key regulatory status in Abu Dhabi According to Tether, the firm focuses on five areas of investment. These include: finance, power, data, education and evolution, with AI investments such as these falling under the category of evolution. With a healthy balance sheet in 2025, the firm has made a series of investments across multiple sectors. In terms of AI, it was reported in mid-November that the firm was considering a hefty $1.15 billion investment in German AI robotics startup Neura. In the announcement, Tether also highlighted some other AI plays it has supported. “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development,” Tether said.

Title: Nomura Sends Bankers to New York, London in Asset Manager Push

(Bloomberg) -- Nomura Asset Management Co. plans to relocate dozens of staff from its Tokyo headquarters to offices in cities such as London and New York to develop its homegrown talent for investment and sales operations. More staff with overseas business experience will boost Nomura’s stance as a global competitor in asset management, President Hiroyasu Koike said in an interview. “Unless we enhance our global investment capabilities, we will lose our reason for being,” he said, adding that he’s still considering specific locations for the staff. “We want to proactively send trainees and transfer staff to greatly strengthen the development of global talent.” Japan’s main finance regulator this year revealed how many domestic asset managers often lag behind overseas rivals due to a narrower product offering that is harming the country’s competitiveness as one of the world’s key financial centers. Reform of tax-free accounts under the Nippon Individual Savings Account scheme is helping to draw more people into investing in a nation traditionally more focused on lower-return savings. Nomura Asset Management currently has about 30 employees stationed abroad and Koike said he intends to significantly boost that figure, without specifying more detail. Potential destinations include existing offices in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other destinations where parent Nomura Holdings Inc. recently acquired some public asset management businesses from Macquarie Group Ltd. in the US and Europe. As of the end of September, Nomura Asset Management oversaw around ¥99.7 trillion ($643 billion). That’s still a sliver compared to global giants like BlackRock Inc., which managed $11.6 trillion as of December 2024. Koike said Nomura’s purchase of the Macquarie assets offers “a chance to grow into a transformed asset management company in five or ten years.” It’s also being considered as a destination for trainee assignments. Previously, Nomura had sent four trainees to American Century Investments, a major US asset manager in which it holds a stake. “I want to acclimatize staff to an environment where they conduct daily business operations in English,” Koike said. “Then, when they return to Japan, it would be ideal if they can leverage that network and what they’ve learned to become future talent capable of engaging in global operations and global management.” --With assistance from Russell Ward.

Title: Robinhood launches staking for Ethereum and Solana in ongoing crypto expansion

Robinhood is doubling down on crypto offerings. The trading app will launch staking for Ethereum and Solana in New York starting on Tuesday, according to the company, allowing customers to earn yield on cryptocurrency. The company will let customers stake in New York and plans to expand across the country. “We’re proud of the momentum we’ve seen with staking and especially excited that staking is now available to customers in New York, which has one of the most rigorous regulatory frameworks in the country,” wrote Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, in a note to Fortune. Staking has been part of the crypto universe for nearly a decade, rewarding users who lock up a stash of tokens in order to help operate a blockchain network. But uncertainty over its legal status has meant it has been mostly experienced crypto users who have engaged in it using their own wallets. In 2023, the exchange Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that it broke the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules by offering staking. Robinhood’s launching of crypto stakes reflects a looser regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. “These crypto enhancements are strategic chess moves positioning Robinhood for the anticipated transformation of financial infrastructure through blockchain technology and tokenization—particularly with the regulatory clarity we expect under the current administration,” said Caydee Blankenship, senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research. Robinhood also announced a push into global crypto markets. In Europe, it will add perpetual futures contracts on several coins, and it will also enter the Indonesian market, as it agreed to buy a brokerage and crypto platform in the country. Robinhood is not new to crypto, as users on the platform have been able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2018. However, the company has beefed up its crypto arm this year. In June, Robinhood completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running crypto exchange. Crypto transactions accounted for more than 21% of the company’s revenue, as of last month’s earnings report. Robinhood’s expansion of its digital assets could help it challenge other crypto exchanges, according to Romeo Alvarez, research analyst at William O’Neil. “Robinhood is stepping up its efforts to compete on a global basis with larger trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Kraken,” he said. The past few days have seen other big banks vie for staking. On Friday, BlackRock filed for a stake Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB). The Wall Street giant already has an Ethereum ETF (ETHA), but that one does not have staking components.

Title: Crypto, TradFi sentiment improves: Will Bitcoin traders clear shorts above $93K?

Improving retail crypto and TradFi investor sentiment align with a recent uptick in Bitcoin price, but sell orders and short positions in the $93,000 range threaten to cap the rally. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin price repeatedly revisited the $90,000 range as retail investor sentiment improved, fund managers restated their bullish expectations for a potential end-of-year rally, and Strategy announced a sizable (BTC) purchase. According to VanEck head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Bernstein’s comments follow BlackRock chair and CEO Larry Fink mentioning that sovereign wealth funds are “incrementally” buying Bitcoin as it “has fallen from its $126,000 peak.” Fink said, Mirroring Fink’s and Bernstein’s view, on Monday, Strategy announced a fresh 10,624 BTC ($962.7 million) purchase at an average $90,615 per coin. Bitwise European head of research Andre Dragosch noted that Strategy’s purchase “was the biggest amount since July 2025.” While Bitcoin’s recovery from its Nov. 21 low of $80,612 has followed the improvement in investor sentiment, the price is still capped in the $90,000 to $93,000 range. On Saturday, chartered market technician Aksel Kibar said, Related: Did BTC's Santa rally start at $89K? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week Cumulative volume data from Hyblock provides a more nuanced view, highlighting rising participation from investors in the 0 to 100 BTC trade cohort, which some analysts label as retail. Larger trade-size cohorts in the 1,000 to 100,000 and 100,000 to 1 million (cumulative volume delta) appear to be selling on rallies in the $90,000 to $93,000 price range. Similarly, order book data for BTC/USDT (perpetual contracts at Binance) shows a wall of asks starting at $90,000 and thickening from $94,000 to $95,000. Liquidation heatmap data, on the other hand, shows short liquidity at $94,000 to $95,300, which could serve as fuel for bulls to attempt a run on $100,000 if the market provides sufficient catalysts to induce an uptick in either spot or futures buying.

Title: ‘Justice was done,’ says Willow Park abuse survivor after ex-teacher Peter Kelly jailed for 10 years
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/12/08/justice-was-done-says-willow-park-abuse-survivor-after-ex-teacher-peter-kelly-jailed-for-10-years/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T21:36:41Z

“The process was brutal but justice was done,” said one man who was abused as a child by teacher Peter Kelly at Willow Park primary school in Dublin’s Blackrock. Kelly (73) was sentenced to a total of 10 years imprisonment at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Monday for the sexual abuse of eight boys at the school in the early to mid-1980s. The trial took place in camera but a number Kelly’s abuse survivors spoke to The Irish Times afterwards. Some did not want their names used. Matthew (not his real name), first made allegations about Kelly 25 years ago, in 2000, to the Willow Park school authorities. This led to Kelly’s resignation in 2004. “They fought me and fought me and fought me and fought me. I’m the original complainant,” he said. “If they had afforded me 1 per cent of the protection that they had afforded him, this would have come out many years ago,” he said. A Garda file on Matthew’s allegations against Kelly was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who decided not to prosecute Kelly. “I left the country. I took that as not being believed,” he said. Kelly was sentenced to five years jail on Monday arising from the allegations made by Matthew. In his victim-impact statement to the court on December 2nd, Matthew recalled how, in order to escape abuse by Kelly at Willow Park, he steered his bicycle into a lamp-post. “At 11 years of age I never stood a chance,” he told the court. “I hated everything to do with school.” These days he is “putting one foot in front of the other. I’m not coping, I’m here,” he told The Irish Times. Aidan Moore, who agreed to be named, felt 10 years was “a fair sentence” for Kelly. “I can’t say I’m happy, because it’s not a happy day but Justice [Elma] Sheahan has given a fair sentence in regard to what the charges were and I am very comfortable with what the sentence is,” he said. Mr Moore has spent most of his life abroad, mainly because of his abuse at Willow Park. “I really feel that I can’t stay here. I spent a number of years in the United States and spent over 20 years in Africa, in Kenya. I’m back here for family reasons but I’m really struggling,” he said. Five of the eight men who made complaints against Kelly also alleged abuse by former Christian Brother Edward Baylor, now deceased. He was referred to by Justice Elma Sheahan in her sentencing judgement as “EB”. He was convicted of child abuse in 1988. Mr Moore said he had been abused by Baylor. “It is clear that the Holy Ghost Fathers/Spiritans enabled, protected and covered up for their abusers. That is one of the reasons why it has taken so long to get to where we are today, the conviction of one paedophile for 28 charges out of the thousands of crimes committed.” It also “required a lot of courage from the victims and their families, and an enormous amount of work by An Garda Síochána and the DPP has gone into achieving this result,” he said. Kieran Freeney said of the case he was “happy that it’s concluded and that we can all move on from this because it’s been over 30 years in the making”. When his mother died by suicide, and with his father living abroad for work reasons, Kieran became a boarder at Willow Park, where he was abused by both Kelly and Baylor at the ages of 11 and 12. Kelly was “the only one that’s alive so, unfortunately for him perhaps, but fortunately for us that we get some closure in our lives and some part of justice being served on behalf of myself and of my colleagues here today and all victims of Blackrock and Willow Park,” he said. For Luke (not his real name), Kelly’s sentence was “in line with what I was hoping for. I think that’s fair.” His own decision to come forward with his allegations followed the RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys in 2022. “I was living in Germany at the time and I came forward. My brother, who is 12 years older than me, was also abused in the school. He has come forward.” As with many survivors, he had high praise for the gardaí involved who did “a fantastic job, especially Rachel Kilpatrick, Aisling Healy and the team”. Overall “the process was brutal but justice was done. It’s OK for people to come forward. There is help out there and the police have a very much victim-led approach. So I urge people to come forward. It’s better out than in,” he said.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher has been jailed for 10 years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests. Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Sentencing Kelly today, Judge Elma Sheahan said she was struck by the bravery of these men who she said “bared their souls” and noted the “eloquent expression of their very real hurt and torment”. She said the injuries suffered included psychiatric issues, addiction and also the inter-generational hurt in the sense that the children and partners of these men have suffered too. Judge Sheahan said the men had waited for decades for their stories to be heard and believed and referred to the fact that during their childhood and adolescence, many could not explain their reasons for withdrawing from their families, their inability to attend school and their various addictions. She said that the worry and upset caused to those close to the victims is more evidence of the damage done by Kelly. Judge Sheahan noted that many of the victims had already suffered very real or significant trauma including the loss or death of parents before she added that a number of the victims had previously been sexually abused by another teacher at the school. She said as such, these victims were “already vulnerable children”. The judge took into account “the gruelling nature” of the trial for the victims while accepting that Kelly was entitled to “call on the State to prove the case against him”. Judge Sheahan said the aggravating features of the case were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused in the lives of the victims, the breach of trust, the age disparity, the repetitive nature of the offending, the number of complainants, the vulnerability of the victims both due to their age and their own personal circumstances as well as the fact that some of the abuse took place in front of their peers. Judge Sheahan said that in mitigation she accepted that Kelly has no previous convictions and is a frail man with many medical conditions, noting that Kelly requires ongoing oncology appointments for treatment for prostate cancer. She said he has lost the single greatest mitigation of a plea of guilty before acknowledging that he does not accept the verdict of the jury. She set various different sentences for each of the offences in relation to each of the victims, ranging from 20 months to five years, before she imposed a global consecutive sentence of 10 years. Judge Sheahan said “given the lack of acceptance on the part of the accused of the verdict, the court does not feel there is any evidential basis on which to suspend any of the sentence”. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” Judge Sheahan said. Earlier, Judge Sheahan was advised that two members of the jury panel were present in the courtroom for the sentence hearing. She said given that the case was to be heard in camera and not open to the public, those members of the jury should not be in court. “The court is always careful to be very thankful to the members of the jury for the work they have done and what they have sat through – the letter of the law would require that strictly speaking as they are no longer members of the jury they should not be in court,” Judge Sheahan said, adding “this is in no way to disregard the work they had done”. At an earlier sentence hearing last week, Judge Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Advertisement Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of times in their lives when they have struggled with thoughts of suicide. They spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made to “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Inspector Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told Judge Sheahan that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Mr Sexton told the court. Judge Sheahan said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Title: BlackRock Seeks SEC Nod To Launch Staked Ethereum ETF
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-seeks-sec-nod-to-launch-staked-ethereum-etf/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T20:32:44Z
Full Content:
In a bold push into on-chain yield exposure, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially applied to list and trade shares of an investment vehicle tied to a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday for its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to investors. The S-1 is part of the SEC’s process for issuers to introduce investment vehicles like ETFs, but does not guarantee approval, and the fund’s listing exchange must still file a separate 19b-4 form. The filing comes a couple of weeks after BlackRock filed a name registration with the state of Delaware for the staking Ethereum trust ETF, signaling intent to file with the SEC soon. Unlike BlackRock’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF, which the company intends to list and trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker ETHB, will track the performance of Ether and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the S-1 reads. BlackRock had previously sought the SEC’s sign-off to add a staking component to ETHA. Though the Commission had acknowledged applications as early as July, it continued to delay a formal decision. Notably, Grayscale Investments has already added a staking functionality to its previously greenlighted spot ETH and mini ETH trusts following the approval of new generic listing standards for commodity trusts, as the SEC’s stance has shifted under new Chairman Paul Atkins. However, BlackRock has decided to launch a completely new fund while others modify their existing vehicles. ETHA remains the largest of its kind with around $16 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, BlackRock manages the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT).

Unlike the firm’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF will track the performance of Ethereum and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the filing reads. The firm’s S-1 registration filing follows the November formation of the Delaware statutory trust, an act that typically precedes the ETF filing for crypto and commodity products. Previously, BlackRock had sought approval to add a staking component to its spot Ethereum ETF, ETHA. While the SEC had acknowledged requests as early as July, it continued to push back a formal decision, last delaying a decision in early September. It’s unclear how ETHB’s filing will affect any plans for staking additions to ETHA. A representative for BlackRock told Decrypt the firm could not comment on its ETHB ETF filing at present time. Ethereum staking ETFs hit the market following the creation of generic listing standards for commodity trusts. Grayscale’s ETHE was first to market in early October, followed by the REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF. But so far, they haven’t eaten into the success of BlackRock’s existing spot ETF. ETHA has more than $11 billion in funds under management, or around 3.6 million ETH, compared to less than $5 billion (or 1.8 million ETH) for Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH Mini Trust ETFs combined. BlackRock’s ETF success is also apparent in the Bitcoin market, highlighted by its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which is the largest crypto ETF on the market with around $70 billion in assets under management. IBIT is up around 1% on Monday as Bitcoin has fallen 1% in the last 24 hours to trade at $90,390. ETHA has jumped more than 3% as Ethereum is roughly flat, changing hands at $3,122. When approved, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB) is expected to trade alongside BlackRock’s other ETFs on the Nasdaq exchange.

Title: IBM To Buy Confluent For $9.3 Billion To Expand AI Services
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ibm-to-buy-confluent-for-93-billion-to-expand-ai-services
Time Published: 2025-12-08T17:25:10Z
Full Content:
International Business Machines Corp. is buying the data-streaming platform Confluent Inc. for about $9.3 billion, marking one of its largest takeovers yet and a major bet on the kind of enterprise software that artificial intelligence tools need to perform tasks in real time. IBM will pay $31 a share, according to a statement issued Monday. The enterprise value, which includes debt, is $11 billion, it said. The companies expect the deal to close by the middle of 2026. If the transaction fails or is terminated, IBM will pay Confluent a breakup fee of $453.6 million, according to an accompanying regulatory filing. The acquisition “could significantly improve IBM’s AI portfolio, and subsequently its software unit’s sales growth,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard wrote Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the deal talks. Confluent shares rose as much as 29% to $29.86 after markets opened in New York, more than a dollar below the offer price. IBM shares rose as much as 2.4%. The AI boom has touched off billions of dollars in deals for businesses that build, train or leverage the technology, propelling the value of an entire ecosystem of data center developers, software makers, generative AI tool developers and data management firms. Mountain View, California-based Confluent sits in the data corner of that world, providing a platform for companies to gather — or “stream” — and analyze data in real time as opposed to shipping data in clunkier batches. Manufacturers such as Michelin, for example, have used Confluent’s platform to optimize their inventories of raw and semi-finished materials live. Instacart adopted Confluent to develop real-time fraud detection systems and gain more visibility into the availability of products sold on its grocery delivery platform. Businesses are increasingly tapping AI systems that manage tasks like this in real-time and require live flows of data to do so. IBM, which pioneered mainframe computers, has been trying to reposition its business around AI over the past few years. Under Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, it’s been buying software companies and selling generative AI-related services to enterprise clients. Software now makes up almost half its total revenue and continues to grow at a steady rate. The Confluent acquisition would be IBM’s biggest since it bought cloud software firm Red Hat for about $34 billion in 2019. Confluent’s takeover stands apart from the multibillion-dollar deals that have dominated the AI space in recent months, largely focused on data centers and the computing power necessary to build and power AI systems themselves. Soaring demand for such capacity has fueled massive transactions, including BlackRock Inc.’s $40 billion purchase of Aligned Data Centers and Oracle Corp.’s agreement to supply OpenAI with about 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, worth as much as $300 billion. Confluent was started in 2014 by a trio of founders who came from LinkedIn, including the company’s current chief executive officer, Jay Kreps. The firm’s shares had fallen 17% this year before news of the deal. The stock is far below its intraday peak of $94.97 a share in November 2021, following the company’s initial public offering. Barclays Plc, Centerview Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised IBM, while Morgan Stanley advised Confluent, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the matter is private. The banks each declined to comment. The acquisition builds on a five-year partnership between the two firms, which allowed some IBM customers to use Confluent’s data-streaming platform. IBM completed its $6.4 billion purchase of HashiCorp Inc. in February and recently considered buying Informatica Inc., another infrastructure-focused vendor that was ultimately acquired by Salesforce Inc.

Title: Survivors of abuser Kelly tell of 'unimaginable trauma'

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent Most of those abused by Peter Kelly as young boys were in court to see him jailed. They stood in silence watching as he was led by prison officers back to the cells in the Criminal Courts. Many broke down afterwards, hugging friends and family members. The former maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock, a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin, was jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Kieran Freeney, whose mother had died shortly before the abuse began said afterwards that he was happy with the sentence as it would give him closure in his lifetime. He said two other predators who had abused children in Willow Park school were now deceased. And he said he was relieved for the other men present in court as well as all victims alive and dead. He said his message to them was that "we got one, and we managed to put him away". Mr Freeney said Kelly should be serving life, but he knew that at his age, ten years would be horrific. He said he hoped he would use his time to reflect on the lives he had damaged. Aidan Moore was seriously abused by another teacher at the school, Edward Baylor, who is now dead. Judge Elma Sheahan said he and a number of other boys, who had also been abused by Baylor, had suffered "unimaginable trauma". Speaking outside court, Mr Moore said today was a victory for all victims of sexual abuse crimes. But he said the fact that the Spiritan order had protected abusers was one of the reasons it had taken so long to get to this point which he said was the conviction of just one paedophile for 28 charges. However, Mr Moore said this victory was not taken lightly and required a lot of courage from victims as well as enormous work by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Moore said he wanted to speak to all victims of sexual abuse especially those struggling. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone. "It is not your shame and it is not your guilt," he said, adding "and you do not have to carry it alone". Mr Moore praised the "incredible courage" of brothers, David and Mark Ryan and their friend Maura Harmon, who revealed the abuse that had been happening in Willow Park and Blackrock College in their groundbreaking documentary "Blackrock Boys", broadcast on RTÉ Radio one in November 2022. He said many men had come forward to tell their stories since. He said others remained silent, and perhaps thought nothing would happen if they spoke up. However, he said today something had been achieved, and a paedophile was "where he belongs, behind bars". Mr Moore said even though these offences happened almost 50 years ago, paedophiles had not gone away. And he believed it was incumbent on every adult to look out for the welfare of children and be proactive in protecting innocent young lives from predatory paedophiles. He said it remained very much a live issue. He said he was standing in front of the courts because if it made a difference in even one person’s life, it would be worth it Mr Moore said the end of the trial and the sentencing was a huge relief and he had not expected the sentence to be as long as it was. He said it had been a very painful process to go through for all victims. He said he hoped other people would come forward so the extent of the abuse at the two schools would be known. Mr Moore also criticised the length of time being taken by the Spiritan order to set up a redress scheme. He said he had gone through an extremely painful settlement process and hoped other people would be able to avoid this. Mr Moore said he would never get over this. He said the effect of child sexual abuse was evident every day. He said it affected his wife, children and everyone who knew him. Spiritan Province 'deeply sorry' for harm In a statement this afternoon, the Spiritan Province said it was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by Peter Kelly while he was a teacher at Willow Park School. The statement said their thoughts were with those who were abused as children by Kelly, and with their loved ones. And they said they hoped the court's verdict and the sentence passed today brought them some measure of validation and justice. The Spiritans said they offered them the same sincere apology that they extended to all who suffered abuse in their schools. The order said it had begun a Restorative Justice process for victims and survivors, and encouraged anyone affected to come forward. It said support was available through the Restore Together Group, the Restorative Justice Team and its services, and the Spiritan Safeguarding Office. Those affected have strongly criticised the amount of time taken by the order to put in place a redress scheme for them. In an earlier statement issued in October, the Spiritan Province said they acknowledged the deep pain and frustration suffered by victims and survivors and also acknowledged progress had not been as fast as anyone would wish. It outlined steps being taken to sell properties in order to make resources available for redress payments. Victim impact statements Last week the court heard victim impact statements from a number of the men. The first man to give his statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he did not want Kelly near him, but he could not get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do to make sure Kelly would not notice him so he would not touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he would not have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse had not happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it could not just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. Aidan Moore told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by Edward Baylor. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. He broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Others also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Judge Sheahan said she hoped today’s sentencing would bring them closure. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.
