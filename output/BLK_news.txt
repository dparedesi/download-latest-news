Without public input, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass went and appointed a “Chief Recovery Officer” to oversee the post-fire rebuilding process—Steve Soboroff has been largely absent, but no doubt collecting a nice little salary. Now, again without public input, Bass intends to hire an “outside consultant” to rebuild the Palisades. Here’s the story, from an article at the Los Angeles Times: The city of Los Angeles is planning to hire an outside consultant to handle a significant rebuilding contract for areas devastated by this month’s Palisades fire, Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. The firm will represent the city’s interests in the wildfire recovery process, including performing damage assessments, monitoring air and water quality, interacting with various federal agencies and ensuring that the city gets as much federal reimbursement as possible, according to chief recovery officer Steve Soboroff. My prediction? Larry Fink and BlackRock. Why? Well, Ukraine. In December of 2022, I wrote a blog on a story that had been kept relatively quiet: Volodomyr Zelensky had taken “pro bono” advice from Fink to establish a “patronage program” in Ukraine, which would give foreign investors (both public and private) the chance to “adopt” areas of Ukraine that had suffered destruction during the war with Russia, and rebuild them to essentially “own” them—Zelensky was selling out what originally belonged to the people to the highest governmental and commercial bidders. Here’s what Zelensky said at the time: Even now, we create a special patronage system. The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. It smelled like money laundering to me—which is coincidentally, one of the things Ukraine is best known for—and reminds me of the Clinton Foundation’s (nonexistent) “work” in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, which saw who knows how much money flood into the Clinton Foundation (Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions? Billions?), a “special patron” if you will, and essentially none to the people of Haiti. Now, details about Bass’s plan “remain scant” (shocker!), but I write this so we remember to keep an eye on it and know exactly what to look out for. Image generated by AI.

Title: Dutch Pension Fund Seeks Divestment from BlackRock

Time Published: 2025-01-27T20:23:59Z

A Dutch pension fund is considering cutting ties with BlackRock because of the manager’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative. PME Pensioenfonds, a pension fund for the metals and technology industry which has more than 620,000 participants, said it was reconsidering the future of its 5 billion euros invested with the manager, according to a memo seen by CIO. The pension fund is among the largest in the Netherlands, with more than 280 billion euros ($294.17 billion) in assets under management. The fund’s investments with BlackRock include money market funds and several index portfolios. PME reportedly controls the composition of, and proxy voting policy of, the investments. The pension fund has said it seeks partners that abide by net-zero plans, and stated concern in the memo with what it called BlackRock’s diminishing ambitions and efforts to support sustainable investing. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  BlackRock departed the initiative, which has sought a transition to net-zero emission portfolios by 2050 and counted 325 signatories who collectively managed $57.5 trillion in assets, earlier this month. The initiative had seen numerous members leave over the past year, including Northern Trust this month. Similar initiatives, such as the Climate Action 100+, which BlackRock also left, and the Net Zero Banking Alliance have seen scores of departures; by the middle of January, all major U.S. banks had withdrawn from the later. BlackRock’s departure from NZAM was significant; the firm has $11.5 billion in assets under management. NZAM suspended its activities shortly after BlackRock’s departure. Despite a pullback from environmental, social, and governance and net-zero initiatives by U.S.-based investors, European ones appear to be continuing their commitments to these values. BlackRock, in the U.S., has been a target of political opponents of ESG and net-zero investing over the manager’s membership in initiatives like the NZAM.

Title: Is Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN) The Best Alternative Meat Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Alternative Meat Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stands against the other alternative meat stocks. The alternative meat industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by environmental concerns, health consciousness, and technological advancements. As of 2025, the market continues to expand, with notable developments in both plant-based and cultivated meat sectors. According to a report by research firm Mordor Intelligence, at the end of 2024, the global meat substitutes market was valued at around $10.36 billion, with projections to reach over $18 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.76% during the forecast period. Similarly, Business Research Company, another market intelligence firm, estimates that the market size for cultivated meat is expected to grow from $9.31 billion in 2024 to close to $11 billion in 2025, at an annual growth rate of 18%. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Several factors are contributing to the burgeoning alternative meat industry. The most important of these is environmental sustainability. Alternative meats, particularly plant-based options, are recognized for their lower environmental impact compared to traditional meat. A study by the Food Foundation, quoted by prominent British newspaper The Guardian, found that plant-based meat alternatives result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and require less water. Another factor contributing to alternative meat popularity is health considerations. The same study noted that plant-based alternatives often contain fewer calories, less saturated fat, and more fiber than conventional meat products. However, it also highlighted that some alternatives may have higher salt content and lack certain nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. Innovations in food technology have led to the development of lab-grown meats, offering solutions to ethical and environmental issues associated with traditional meat production. The cultivated meat industry is projected to be valued at $25 billion globally by 2030. Despite the positive trajectory, the alternative meat industry faces several challenges. These include production costs, consumer acceptance, and nutritional fortification, among others. With increasing investments, technological innovations, and a growing consumer base seeking sustainable and healthy food options, the industry is set to play a significant role in the future of food production. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected food stocks that offer alternative meat products. Companies that mainly produce beef are also included in the list for comparison purposes. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A farmer in a field, bringing in the harvest of live fed cattle for the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. Tyson Foods has expanded into the alternative meat market over the past few years, offering various plant-based and blended products. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. As per the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, the sales were $13,565 million, increasing 1.6% from the prior year, and the GAAP operating income was $525 million, increasing $988 million from the prior year. This demonstrates the company's efficient core business operations, driven by better cost management and improved pricing, leading to higher profitability. Moreover, the company has introduced the Jimmy Dean Plant-Based Breakfast Sausage Patty, which aims to deliver the signature taste of the traditional Jimmy Dean sausage in a plant-based format. This would appeal to consumers seeking healthier meat alternatives. Lastly, the company has also launched the Raised & Rooted brand, which includes various plant-based products such as burger patties, bratwurst, Italian sausages, and ground meat alternatives. Overall TSN ranks 4th on our list of the best alternative meat stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of TSN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than TSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock selloff gets ugly as AI jitters jolt trading: Markets wrap

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation.The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names.“The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98.“I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.”At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks.“We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.”Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical.“Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said.The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.“Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households.However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.”“We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.”To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon.“If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted.In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32.All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies.Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years.“This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.”“We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI’s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded.What exactly is DeepSeek?DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the U.S. after its release in early January.The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Corporate Highlights:—UBS Group AG has begun a wave of job cuts in its home market Switzerland, with hundreds of employees receiving notice in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.—AT&T Inc. posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, including better-than expected increases in mobile-phone customers and fiber-based internet subscribers, driven by seasonal promotions and bundled product offerings.—Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group has nominated nine candidates for United States Steel Corp.’s board and is pushing for the company to abandon a takeover by Nippon Steel Corp.—SoFi Technologies Inc. published a forecast for profit that missed analysts’ estimates.—MicroStrategy Inc. bought $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, after announcing plans for the early redemption of convertible notes and approving an increase to amount of authorized common shares.Key events this week:—U.S. consumer confidence, durable goods, Tuesday—Fed rate decision followed by news conference by Chair Jerome Powell, Wednesday—Canada rate decision, Wednesday—Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, ASML earnings, Wednesday—Eurozone ECB rate decision, consumer confidence, unemployment, GDP, Thursday—U.S. GDP, jobless claims, Thursday—Apple, Deutsche Bank, Thursday—ECB rate decision followed by news conference by President Christine Lagarde, Thursday—U.S. personal income & spending, PCE inflation, employment cost index, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:Stocks—The S&P 500 fell 1.9% as of 2:51 p.m. New York time—The Nasdaq 100 fell 3.7%—The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%—The MSCI World Index fell 1.5%—Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 3.7%—Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 10%—The Russell 2000 Index fell 1.4%Currencies—The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%—The euro was little changed at $1.0492—The British pound was little changed at $1.2487—The Japanese yen rose 1% to 154.47 per dollarCryptocurrencies—Bitcoin fell 4.9% to $99,401.98—Ether fell 6.7% to $3,075.6Bonds—The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%—Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.53%—Britain’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.59%Commodities—West Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.2% to $73.04 a barrel—Spot gold fell 1.2% to $2,738.57 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.(With assistance from Margaryta Kirakosian, Allegra Catelli and Catherine Bosley.)©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names. “The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98. “I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.” At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks. “We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.” Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical. “Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said. The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households. However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.” “We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.” To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon. “If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted. In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32. All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years. “This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.” “We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment.

Title: Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG): AI-Optimized Clean Energy and Strategic Partnerships Drive Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Private Credit’s Big Squeeze: How the Arms Race for Scale Is Reshaping the Market
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/private-credit-consolidation-market-impact/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:17:48Z
Full Content:
Private credit is in the midst of an arms race as mega-managers scramble to dominate this booming segment of the asset management industry. BlackRock (BLK)’s announced acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December—its second manager acquisition of the year—highlights an accelerating consolidation trend that promises both opportunities for the largest funds and potential challenges for the market. In addition, Goldman Sachs (GS)’ recent creation of its Capital Solutions Group, a business unit focused on private credit advisory and investing, and JPMorgan Chase’s partnerships with several private credit firms underscore Wall Street’s largest banks’ determination to capitalize on the growth of private credit. Could this rush of capital to industry giants leave middle-market lenders—and the vital swath of American businesses they serve—starved for capital at a time when traditional bank lending remains constrained?

You can opt out anytime. The advantages of economies of scale in asset management are compelling and well-documented. Asset manager revenue is directly tied to the amount of assets under management (AUM). As firms increase AUM, their fixed costs for technology, research and infrastructure can be spread across a larger base, effectively reducing the per-dollar cost of managing client funds. Large asset managers can also negotiate better terms with service providers and counterparties, enabling these firms to develop more sophisticated investment capabilities and risk management systems, which, in theory, can lead to better returns. In addition to scaling AUM, BlackRock’s acquisition of Preqin, a leading private market data vendor, last year highlights its intent to not only grow managed assets but also differentiate its platform by building infrastructure and capabilities that it can vertically integrate into its core investing functions. The benefits of scale, however, may have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. As funds grow in size, deploying capital effectively becomes more challenging—fewer deals are large enough for these firms to allocate capital efficiently. This dynamic creates a consolidation paradox: as private credit managers achieve greater scale, they necessarily focus on mega deals, creating potential market inefficiencies that could undermine the industry’s original purpose. The unprecedented inflow of capital to private credit has spurred the industry’s growth, but with a majority of capital flowing to the largest managers, it’s dramatically widening the gap between the large funds and smaller players. For smaller funds, this shift has been stark. Preqin data shows the 10 largest private credit funds claimed 51 percent of capital raised through the third quarter of 2023, compared to 35 percent for all of 2022. For funds outside of the top 50, the share of capital raised plummeted from 22 percent to 9 percent over the same period. As the largest private credit managers scale, it threatens to create a void in middle-market lending. While a $50 million direct lending deal might fit with a $1 billion AUM fund, it’s inefficient for a fund with several hundred billion dollars in AUM to deploy resources to small deals that would account for a de minimis percent of overall returns. With fewer funds willing to deploy capital to middle-market deals, what happens to these businesses that find themselves with less access to capital? With nearly 200,000 such companies accounting for over one-third of U.S. GDP and employing 48 million people, the potential credit vacuum for these borrowers represents more than just a market inefficiency; it’s a structural challenge that could stifle economic growth and innovation. This consolidation pattern mirrors developments in private equity, where mid-sized firms increasingly find themselves in an existential crisis. As Goldman Sachs’ Mike Brandmeyer recently observed, many PE firms “stuck in the middle” face a stark choice between making significant investments to scale up or selling to larger platforms that already have the necessary infrastructure. With institutional investors showing a clear preference for either the largest or newest managers, this “barbelling” effect is forcing consolidation across alternative assets. This pattern reveals a stark irony in the industry’s evolution. The private credit industry was primarily borne out as a response to post-financial crisis regulations that made it costly for banks to serve smaller, riskier borrowers. Yet, as private credit managers consolidate and scale, they appear to follow a similar path to the banks they initially sought to replace, prioritizing larger, more profitable clients at the expense of smaller businesses. For small and mid-sized managers, the changing landscape demands strategic adaptation. Some are finding success through sector specialization or by building stronger regional relationships. Others are exploring partnerships or technological solutions as alternatives to traditional scale advantages. The non-sponsored deal market, or direct lending, where competition tends to be less intense, offers another avenue for differentiation. Specifically, according to the IMF, about 70 percent of private credit deals go to sponsor-backed companies, leaving a significant opportunity for managers to capitalize on direct lending transactions. While requiring more intensive origination efforts, these direct-to-company relationships can offer attractive economics and deeper borrower relationships compared to sponsor-backed deals, as lenders aren’t competing with multiple sponsors’ existing lending relationships. While private credit operating outside the traditional banking system limits the systemic risk imposed on the overall financial system, their interconnectedness and substantial market share naturally raise questions about market stability and contagion risk during periods of stress. For example, stress at any single major private credit player could have outsized effects on market stability and credit availability to both large and mid-sized businesses The future of private credit will be defined by those who can balance scale with efficiency. Mega-managers must find ways to serve smaller borrowers without sacrificing efficiency, while mid-sized players need to lean into specialization and innovation to stay relevant. Ultimately, the winners will be those who can adapt without losing sight of the industry’s original mission—filling the credit gaps that banks left behind. Banks are increasingly partnering with private credit funds to provide their commercial clients with alternative financing options when traditional bank loans aren’t feasible—a sign of how the market is adapting to serve borrower needs. The private credit market’s continued evolution will test whether these innovations can effectively balance the advantages of scale with the necessity of serving a diverse borrower base.

Title: Trump Can Win Again—Advancing Carbon Capture For 2025

Full Content:
WA Parish plant infrastructure at Fort Bend County. NGR Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration ... [+] Corporation built the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project. The project is a commercial-scale carbon capture system that captures carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from an existing unit at the WA Parish power plant. Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, in Houston. ( Marie D. De Jesus / Houston Chronicle ) (Photo by Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) The first Trump administration had a better record in carbon capture by allowing states to approve permits for carbon dioxide injection wells. There is no reason not to give consumers what they want to buy. The second Trump administration should reverse Biden’s EPA carbon capture policy to guarantee U.S. energy dominance. Polls show that a majority of Americans, including Texans, want a lower emissions future. Carbon capture is a primary tool in the emissions reduction portfolio, and the major oil companies are leading the way by investing billions of dollars in capital and jobs to offset not only their own emissions but their customers’ emissions. The Biden administration did not pursue a forward thinking policy with carbon capture and left office not only with dozens of Class VI carbon dioxide injection well applications still pending but the applications by oil producing states to take over the well permitting task from the federal government. The Biden administration’s attitude was that approving carbon capture projects by oil companies only facilitated further use of fossil fuels. This hostility towards the oil industry was counterproductive and set back efforts to lower emissions by four years. Carbon capture projects are underway in a dozen states. The earliest began in Terrell, Texas, in 1972 with the captured carbon dioxide injected being used for EOR, enhanced oil recovery, and most operating carbon capture projects today are paired with EOR projects. More recent projects reclaim the waste carbon dioxide to produce ethanol for applications in fuels, vodka, hand sanitizers, and perfume. The world is decades away from eliminating fossil fuels. Oil and gas production in Africa is driving economic development there and with it, the reduced mortality rates that will be the largest contributor to an expected global population growth of 2 billion people over the next 30 years. While it is obvious that they will not all drive SUVs, they will have electricity, communications, healthcare, and mass transit. The question now becomes, will the U.S. continue its energy dominance with solutions to the emissions problem? Occidental Petroleum and BlackRock have combined forces to build the world’s largest Direct Air Capture project in Ector County, Texas. The STRATOS project will begin operation later this year. Shell is pursuing carbon capture projects in the U.K., Canada, and in Deer Park, Texas. Chevron is operating carbon sequestration facilities in Australia and California. BP is researching sequestration in Indiana, where Archer Daniels Midlands already operates a Class VI injection well. ExxonMobil operates a 1,500 mile network of CO2 pipelines for EOR, industrial use, and storage—currently 9 million metric tons per year—with a completed well in East Texas and an offshore lease of 270,000 acres in Texas for storage. States are leading the energy transition. In Texas, the installed capacity of wind farms and solar farms is greater than that of natural gas power plants because the state’s elected leaders accommodated the growth. The Texas pipeline of wind and solar projects under construction means that renewable electricity will become the dominant supply in a matter of months. And if the Trump EPA grants primacy to the states for approvals of Class VI carbon injection wells, the states will be able to accommodate the pent-up demand for carbon capture. The Trump administration is a fan of market solutions, and these long-term carbon capture investments are led by domestic and foreign private capital. State and federal support via subsidies and tax breaks are helpful but certainly not the primary catalyst. Complaining about these supports invites comparisons to the oil industry’s tax subsidies and does not contribute to the discussion of advancing a proven solution. It is counter-productive to stand in the way of a demonstrated market with willing buyers and willing sellers already in place. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Shiba Inu Community Highlights 10 Reasons Why SHIB ETF Approval Is Inevitable

As the Trump administration’s crypto executive order takes effect, expectations are rising for more Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2025. Among these anticipations, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful that a SHIB ETF could soon gain approval. In a tweet on Monday, “Shibizens” a Shiba Inu-focused news platform, outlined ten reasons why major financial institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale should list a SHIB ETF. Notably, the platform highlighted SHIB’s “massive market opportunity,” driven by its global base of over 1.3 million holders. It also pointed to Shibarium’s operational Layer 2 blockchain, which supports diverse use cases in gaming, DeFi, and utility tokens such as BONE and TREAT. The platform further emphasized SHIB’s affordability, which appeals to retail investors and expands the potential client base for institutional players. Its high liquidity and trading volume add to its stability, while the broad range of assets within the Shiba Inu ecosystem offers strong diversification prospects. Additionally, Shibizens argued that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs sets a powerful precedent, demonstrating robust demand for crypto-based investment products. “Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have shown strong demand. SHIB, as a next-generation blockchain project, is a logical step to capture the growing appetite for diversified crypto products.” It wrote. As per the platform, SHIB’s commitment to social causes, exemplified by the Shib Karma Foundation, also resonates with ESG-conscious investors. Additionally, with its global reach and innovative blockchain approach, SHIB positions itself as a forward-thinking investment. In conclusion, the platform argued that introducing a SHIB ETF would play a key role in driving the next wave of crypto innovation while strengthening the position of issuers as forward-thinking leaders in wealth management. “By launching a SHIB ETF, companies like BlackRock can capitalize on emerging crypto trends, meet growing investor demand, and establish themselves as leaders in digital asset management,” It added. This surge in optimism follows the SEC’s approval of similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. Notably, after the spot ETH ETF approval last May, Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, sent a congratulatory message to Ethereum, cryptically hinting that SHIB could be next in line. Lucie, a leading spokesperson for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has also consistently advocated for the potential of a SHIB ETF. Last July, she expressed strong confidence, stating, “Do I think a SHIB ETF will happen? Most definitely,” citing growing institutional interest in SHIB’s decentralized framework. Last week, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas suggested that more cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for TRUMP and DOGE, are likely to be approved before April, a move that could open doors for others like SHIB. That said, despite the SEC’s lack of indication regarding meme coin ETFs, the SHIB community remains resolute. Campaigns continue to apply pressure on asset managers to front such products to the SEC, with a Change.org petition led by the SHIB army aimed at Grayscale already attracting over 11,000 signatures.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline.

He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline.

Go ahead and continuously improvement concept, silhouette man jump on a cliff from past to future ... [+] with cloud sky background. The landscape of digital assets is undergoing a significant shift as pro crypto regulatory clarity begins to take shape. Policymakers are moving faster than the price of Bitcoin. In recent weeks, significant developments, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) withdrawal of the contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) via SAB 122 and President Trump’s January 23, 2025 Digital Assets Executive Order, signal a bullish trajectory for crypto policies. Meanwhile, traditional banks, burdened by outdated frameworks and resistance to the emerging digital asset industry, risk establishing their foothold in this rapidly evolving sector. SAB 121, introduced during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tenure, required financial institutions to account for customer-held crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. While purportedly intended to protect investors from insolvency risks, critics lambasted the guidance as overly punitive and impractical for innovation. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce quickly celebrated the SEC’s decision to revoke SAB 121in an X/Twitter post, and bid SAB 121 “a not-so-fond farewell”. SAB 122 directs firms to follow FASB and international accounting standards, which better suit the evolving crypto landscape. Peirce highlighted that this change removes a regulatory barrier, fostering innovation and collaboration between crypto firms and financial institutions. This rollback reduces operational burdens and encourages institutional participation, paving the way for broader crypto adoption. On the heels of the SEC announcement came President Trump's much-anticipated Digital Assets Executive Order. This policy framework overhaul addresses longstanding issues, including the legal categorization of digital assets, taxation, and cross-border applications​. The EO outlines key pillars aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection: These measures signal the administration’s recognition of blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize finance and other industries. In stark contrast to the policy momentum, traditional banks remain ensnared in skepticism and operational inertia, much of which can be attributed to prudential regulators’ admonitions. Documents obtained by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request initiated by Coinbase revealed that U.S. regulators informally discouraged banks from expanding crypto services, despite officially denying a policy of "debanking"​​, also referred to within the crypto industry as Chokepoint 2.0. While crypto adoption surged globally, most banks have failed to innovate their offerings. Their hesitancy contrasts starkly with the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, which are actively expanding crypto-based investment products​​. As regulatory clarity improves, banks must pivot quickly to avoid irrelevance. Opportunities include: Collaborating with fintech and blockchain startups: Banks can integrate blockchain to enhance cross-border payments and real-time settlement systems. Investing in crypto infrastructure: Developing secure custodial services and compliance solutions will attract institutional clients exploring crypto markets. Educating stakeholders: From brokers to customers, knowledge-building is critical to bridge the gap between traditional finance and emerging technologies​​. Failure to adapt will likely result in a widening gap between innovators and incumbents, where fintech players dominate while banks struggle to maintain relevance. The SEC's revised stance and the administration's pro-crypto policies underscore the urgency for financial institutions to adapt. While regulators open the door for innovation, banks are at a crossroads: evolve or be left behind. As the digital asset revolution accelerates, the institutions that embrace this paradigm shift will shape the future of finance, while those clinging to legacy models risk extinction. While many banks have hesitated to embrace the digital assets revolution, others have positioned themselves as trailblazers, leveraging crypto innovations to secure a foothold in the industry. However, the stark contrast between public rhetoric and private actions among certain institutions reveals a hypocrisy that cannot be ignored. Some financial institutions have embraced the crypto wave, proactively adapting their models to stay ahead of the curve. Fidelity Investments stands out as a pioneer in institutional crypto adoption. Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in 2018, the company has offered secure custodial services and direct access to bitcoin for institutional investors. Fidelity was also among the first to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada and played a key role in the U.S. debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, when nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs and two conversions hit the market, collectively drawing $1.9 billion in inflows during their first three days of trading, according to Reuters. Similarly, Goldman Sachs, once a crypto skeptic, has now emerged as a player in legitimizing digital assets within traditional finance. The bank operates a robust digital asset desk, offering clients access to cash-settled derivatives, options, and futures tied to Bitcoin. According to Mathew McDermott, Goldman’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the firm has developed a comprehensive suite of crypto products to meet growing institutional demand. In the second quarter of 2024, Goldman made its debut in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds, including a $238 million stake in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank also disclosed positions in ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Invesco, as detailed in CNBC’s coverage of its Q2 filings. In stark contrast, Bank of America (BoA) has been a notorious laggard. While quietly filing for blockchain-related patents for years, the bank has publicly downplayed the potential of cryptocurrencies. BoA’s leadership has repeatedly warned clients of crypto's volatility, characterizing it as a “speculative bubble.” Despite these claims, the bank's internal research division acknowledged in a 2021 report that blockchain technology could fundamentally reshape finance. BoA’s inconsistency underscores its struggle to reconcile crypto's potential with its conservative stance​​. In a recent Squawk Box interview during Davos 2025, BoA CEO Brian Moynihan hedged his bets regarding institutional adoption of crypto, acknowledging BofA and other banking incumbents may have to adopt crypto payments given the regulatory shift. Wells Fargo has similarly been slow to act. Although offering limited crypto-related investment products to wealthy clients in 2021, years behind competitors, the bank has focused primarily on cautionary narratives about crypto fraud and environmental concerns rather than embracing innovation. The bank’s approach began to pivot in 2024, permitting bitcoin ETF investments for clients who specifically requested access. Additionally, according to DeCrypt.co, paperwork filed with the SEC shows that the bank had purchased shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF, and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider. Perhaps the most striking example of hypocrisy lies with JPMorgan Chase. For years, CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of bitcoin’s most vocal critics, famously calling it a “fraud” in 2017 and warning that it would “blow up.” Publicly, Dimon continues to maintain a stance of disdain for cryptocurrencies, repeatedly labeling them as speculative assets with no inherent value. However, JPMorgan has been integrating blockchain and digital asset into its operations for years. The bank developed JPM Coin (now rebranded Kinexys Digital Payments), a digital token designed to facilitate instant cross-border payments for institutional clients, showcasing its faith in blockchain technology for real-world applications. Moreover, JPMorgan has become a key player in the Bitcoin ETF space, serving as an authorized participant for the Blackrock bitcoin ETF (IBIT). JPMorgan's dual approach—public skepticism paired with internal adoption—highlights a troubling trend among some legacy institutions. These banks publicly criticize cryptocurrencies, discouraging retail clients from participating with brash headlines, while leveraging the same technology to bolster their institutional offerings and operational efficiencies. This pattern of public disdain and private opportunism is more than a marketing inconsistency; it undermines trust. As retail investors increasingly notice this duplicity, they may shift loyalty to forward-thinking incumbents, fintech startups, crypto-native institutions that offer transparency and alignment with the industry's ethos. Banks that remain insincere about their crypto involvement risk alienating a growing segment of clients who view blockchain technology as the future of finance. Transparency and trust are paramount in the new digital asset economy. As digital assets evolve, banking professionals face a clear choice: adapt or risk irrelevance. While some institutions have embraced blockchain technology, many still lag in understanding and integrating crypto into their services. Here’s how banking professionals can stay competitive: Crypto and blockchain are no longer fringe concepts. Banking professionals must understand blockchain’s foundational concepts, including cryptocurrencies, DeFi (decentralized finance), and NFTs. Staying informed about regulatory updates from the SEC, CFTC, IRS and prudential regulators is also critical. Internal continuing education and client education is key. Blockchain’s value extends far beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key applications include: To meet evolving client needs, banks must innovate. Priority areas include: Rather than reinventing the wheel, banks should collaborate with fintech startups and blockchain companies to accelerate adoption. Partnerships can fast-track blockchain implementation in clearing, settlements, and lending. With increasing regulatory clarity, compliance can be a competitive advantage. By proactively addressing anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), and taxation requirements, banks can position themselves as trusted leaders in the crypto space. Internal inertia is often a bank’s biggest obstacle. Leadership must prioritize innovation by recruiting blockchain experts, upskilling staff, and piloting crypto-related projects. The digital assets landscape in the United States and beyond is evolving rapidly, creating both opportunities and challenges for financial professionals. With regulatory clarity improving, including the Digital Assets Executive Order and the withdrawal of SAB 121, the path is clear for broader institutional adoption. Traditional banks can no longer justify a head-in-sand approach and now face an urgent and unavoidable crossroads: embrace innovation to lead in this new financial era or cling to outdated models and risk obsolescence. Financial professionals must act now to build the expertise, infrastructure, and partnerships needed to thrive. Those who hesitate may find themselves sidelined in this new digital asset economy.

Looking back, 2024 was a spectacular year for the crypto world, marking a transformative milestone in technology, markets, and ecosystems. It will be remembered as a landmark chapter in the crypto history, with surging institutional interest in crypto assets, technology innovations, regulatory advancements and Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new heights fuelled by the crypto friendly Trump administration. We just entered the new year 2025. For me it is a tradition to deliver a blog in which I present the main trends for the new year on blockchain and crypto. This blog that will be somewhat longer than normal, dives into the core trends that will further shape the crypto market in 2025 and beyond. thereby increasingly transforming traditional finance. I Existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption A first trend we will see is that in 2025 existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption. Most important are tokenised real world Assets (RWA), DeFi, crypto ETFs as well as the introduction of more stablecoins. Tokenised RWAs reshaping finance One of the most significant trends in 2024 reshaping finance is the tokenisation of real-world assets, like property, commodities, real estate and securities, attracting both investors and companies from of a range of industries. This is transforming traditional finance, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in the financial markets to various assets classes. By converting real world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenisation is unlocking new investment opportunities and making traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate, more accessible.to a wider range of investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making them tradable even in small fractions, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for traditionally nonliquid assets The trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) is expected to take off in an accelerated way in 2025 hitting critical mass, revolutionizing how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology. 2025 will push the boundaries of what can be tokenized. From medical data to personal biometrics, tokenizing assets once deemed untouchable will unlock new markets and create unprecedented opportunities for digital value. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): reaching all-time highs Decentralized finance (DeFi) that refers to financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks, has exploded over the past few years. They provide decentralized alternatives to banking, lending, and trading. But this is just the beginning. DeFi is projected to expand significantly in 2025 and beyond, remaining a dominant force in the crypto space. Tokenized securities and high-value assets will thereby catalyse DeFi’s growth, attracting both retail and institutional investors, adding new liquidity and utility. The DeFi sector could benefit from further integration with traditional financial systems, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, and DeFi platforms such as automated market makers (AMM's) and decentralised exchanges (DEX's) become more mature and more user-friendly, it is likely that a growing number of investors will turn to these services for flexible lending and borrowing solutions. This year the DeFi market could reach a $100 billion valuation as more platforms solidify their roles within the ecosystem, more than double compared to 2024.. Increased Market Share of Crypto ETFs Crypto ETFs have seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in January 2024. This marked a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for traditional financial players to include these products in their portfolios without the need for navigating crypto exchanges and wallets. This approval already provided a massive inflow of institutional capital, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a notable boost above $100.000, following the announcement of Trump’s presidential victory. The emergence and growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could continue through 2025, significantly accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin ETFs would get more inflows than ever before and maybe reach $40–50 billion this year. The popularity of these ETFs might greatly improve the situation of Bitcoin on the market. Building on the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the more crypto friendly Trump administration, this year could mark a turning point for other cryptocurrency ETFs. There are currently over 10 ETF applications, including Solana (SOL) and XRP, pending review by the SEC for assets signalling the potential for expanded institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets. Such ETFs and other ETPs may continue to increase liquidity and stability in the blockchain and digital asset market. Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Time Published: 2025-01-27T07:30:36Z

Some analysts maintain that altcoins could still outperform Bitcoin despite a delayed start of the rally. Per the Ethereum [ETH] MVRV Pricing Bands, each bullish cycle saw ETH surpass the 3.2 MVRV Pricing Band, indicating strong investor optimism and market momentum during these periods. At press time, ETH’s price was at $3,330, which was significantly below the 3.2 MVRV band priced at $6,770. This discrepancy suggested that while ETH was valued reasonably in terms of its historical realized price, it hasn’t reached the euphoric valuation peaks as in past bullish cycles. The bands at lower MVRV ratios, like 0.8, 1.0, and 2.4, sit at $1,693.33, $2,116.66, and $5,080.00 respectively, serving as potential support levels during market retractions. Source: Ali Charts/X Considering this, ETH could see significant upside potential if it approaches and surpasses the 3.2 band in future bullish conditions. This would not only reflect growing market confidence but also suggest a possible continuation of ETH’s uptrend in coming cycles. Additionally, ETH’s resistance indicated critical turning points where ETH either faced a pullback or a breakthrough. Breaking past this, then followed by a substantial uptrend, could suggest a bullish continuation. Ethereum appeared to be approaching this level once again, which could trigger a rally towards $6770. This move could be in line with historical cycles where Ethereum gathered significant momentum after crossing the MVRV threshold. Source: TradingView A successful break past the resistance could lead to a surge in buying activity. This is supported by the fact that BlackRock now holds over 1.2M ETH through its Spot ETF, while Fidelity’s FETH holds 432K ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW holds 105K ETH. The inflows suggest rising institutional demand. Finally, analysts are having different views on ETH, probably because of the delayed altseason. Michael van de Poppe called it the “most hated rally” suggesting a surprising bullish run, one that market sentiment did not initially favor. Also, Joao Wedson noted that altcoins have already dropped significantly, so it’s likely that many will recover and outperform Bitcoin. This predicted rally could coincide with a growing interest in “real utility coins,” or cryptos that offer functional, real-world applications. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025–2026 As institutional interest in utility-focused tokens increases, their adoption could boost demand for Ethereum, given its key role in the blockchain ecosystem. As ETH approaches the MVRV value again in 2025, sustaining institutional embracement could lead to a strong uptrend, defying initial market skepticism and solidifying its position in both market valuation and utility.

U.S. stocks notched back-to-back weekly gains last week and although the rally paused on Friday, the S&P 500 still hit a fresh record during the day. It comes after the U.S. leader called for lower interest rates and cheaper oil prices in a Thursday address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Investors have also been betting on potential tax cuts and deregulation under the new president, sending stocks higher. Not everyone is bullish looking ahead, however, with some — such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon — suggesting markets could be overpriced. After a week of interviews with business leaders, lawmakers and investors in the Swiss ski resort, here's what top industry names told CNBC: "I'm cautiously optimistic — that being said I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. "I believe if we were to unlock all this private capital we're going to have enormous growth, [but], at the same time, some of this is going to unlock new inflationary pressures," he explained. "And I do believe that's the risk that is not factored into the market." Pick said he believed corporate earnings could lift growth in markets over the next 12 to 24 months as they "continue to be strong." "That is kind of the indicator … How many companies right now are really talking about recession, how many are talking about inflation? I feel like the earnings pull through looks pretty sanguine," he said. "More importantly, I know we like to look at the index, but the index is dominated by half a dozen technology companies — which, by the way are all doing great — but if you look at the deregulation possibilities in the energy sector, in the financial services sector, those sectors are still in multiples that aren't that expensive," Pick added. "If you're an investor and you think about allocating over the next 12 to 18 months, sure there could be a drawdown at the index level, but [do] you really want to be thinking about where do I have sector exposure?" Lagarde told Karen Tso that there was divergence in monetary policy between the euro area and the U.S. due to a "different economic setting." She also said that she was not "overly concerned" about the risk that inflation abroad will be imported into Europe, adding that she expected the ECB will continue to gradually lower interest rates as the price growth rate moves toward target. "We are certainly interested to see the U.S. grow, because growth in the U.S. has always been a favorable factor for the rest of the world," Lagarde said. "I don't think you should give any advice to the U.S., but if you look at the risk to financial markets, I think inflation is for sure one, all driven by tariffs," Tangen said Tuesday. "Geopolitical tensions generally are negative for financial markets and for financial returns." Tangen added that "purely financially," Trump's arrival was going to be "very positive" for a lot of U.S. companies. Dimon said he thinks U.S. asset prices are "kind of inflated" at their current levels. "By any measure, they are in the top 10% or 15%," Dimon told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday, referring to U.S. stock markets. "They're elevated and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices. "We're all hoping for that, and having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there and they can tend to surprise you," he added. Solomon said markets were in risk-on mode and that there was a sense of optimism in equities both because of the new U.S. administration and because of advances in technology. Solomon also told Andrew Ross Sorkin that he was noticing a focus on growth, in the U.S., as well as in his conversations with European clients at Davos. "I think people are optimistic, and it's not going to be a smooth, perfect path, but people are optimistic that we are going to run a more growth-prone agenda. We're going to free up some investment, we're going to unlock the private sector a little but more, and that's got to be constructive," he said. "It's hard to dispute the fact that equity multiples are high ... I think the equity markets exhibit a sense of optimism at the moment, but they also exhibit a sense of optimism around growth and technology, in particular this AI wave. Of course it's not going to be a straight line, but some of the technology we're seeing, the opportunities for that technology to improve productivity meaningfully are extraordinary." "Continuing on the trends we've seen in 2024 being a positive year in most markets … I see that continuing in 2025, I see a continuation of strong tailwinds in the in the core markets, the U.S., Asia, particularly the growth driven markets in Asia," al-Mubarak told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday. "I see a continuation of good tailwinds in technology and healthcare and financial services, life sciences," he added. "So I would say, maybe almost the same words I used last year: cautiously optimistic. When I look at 2025, it's going to be an exciting year." Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told CNBC that price-earnings ratios were high in U.S. markets, but that there could be further scope to climb in artificial intelligence beneficiaries. "We have gone pretty far already ...I think it's led by the sectors that are great sectors, the disruptors, AI and so on." "I don't think it's been carried down to the applications of AI, to the uses of AI ... the applications of AI are under-discounted I think." Moynihan told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday he thought U.S. markets had room to climb in 2025, and that the key concern for business and financial services would be regulatory policy, rather than inflation. "Our research team thinks there's room to go this year, they predict the market to go up. Not as much as last year, and the unusual thing is you had a couple years in a row of very strong growth, but that was coming off a couple years of very unusual times," he said. Moynihan added, "I believe that if you look at the key thing for businesses generally, including financial services and the banking businesses, it's the regulation question." Tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could prevent disinflation and keep interest rates higher, the banking chief told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday. "Inflation is much more sticky than we have been saying," Ermotti said. "Tariffs will probably not really help inflation to come down. And therefore I don't see [interest] rates coming down as fast as people believe," he said. Venkatakrishnan, whose British bank makes around 40% of its revenue in the U.S., said he was "optimistic" about U.S. deal activity this year. "I think there are two things driving it. One is interest rates have reached a relatively stable level. Our own economists are calling for maybe one rate cut in the U.S. over the next year," he told Andrew Ross Sorkin. "They're still high, but they're stable, so you can at least plan better, because you don't have the volatility in rates. The second is with the change in [U.S.] administration, it should be easier for mergers to take place." Venkatakrishnan added that he expected President Trump to relax regulation, which would be "generally good for business sentiment and good for business opportunity." The U.K. needs to attract more oversees investment to boost economic growth, Reeves told CNBC. "My message to U.S. investors and global investors too is: Britain is open for business, we want your investment." She also discussed Trump's global tariff threats. "I do understand that President Trump is concerned about countries that are running large and persistent surpluses on the trade balance with the U.S. That's not the case for the U.K.," Reeves said. "We are not part of the problem here. So we, the U.K., increased trade with President Trump last time he was in office." Sinding, CEO of Swedish private equity firm EQT, told CNBC's Karen Tso and Steve Sedgwick on the ground that the market for M&A and big business deals was "continuing to improve." "We had a record year in 2024 we did over $20 billion of investments," he said. "We did more than $10 billion of exits, and that's kind of building up to 2025, [when] I think a lot of the market participants are now ready to transact, whether it's private equity or family offices or strategic buyers. And, of course, if you look at the global capital markets, the IPO market is wide open. The credit markets are strong, so we're fairly positive looking into the next year."

Title: Trump is searching for potential TikTok buyers

President Donald Trump wants a US investor to take a major stake in ByteDance’s TikTok. Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the US and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Mr Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50 per cent stake to the US government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. Mr Trump reportedly said Saturday that he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and that he would likely decide on its future in the next 30 days. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Mr Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world’s richest person is leading Mr Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Mr Musk acquire TikTok’s US operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok’s chief executive had been soliciting advice from Mr Musk ahead of Trump’s inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Mr Musk for comment. “Elon Musk continues to be front and centre as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done,” financial services company Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Wednesday. “Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view,” the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Mr Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. “Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny,” Ms Schindler said. Mr Trump has also said he’d “like” to see Oracle chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Mr Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans last Tuesday, where Mr Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. “What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we’ll give you the permit,” Mr Trump said before turning to Mr Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. “Sounds like a good deal to me Mr President,” Mr Ellison replied. Mr Ellison and his company are currently at the centre of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the US. Given its existing relationship with TikTok, Oracle and is “directly invested in TikTok’s success in the region,” Scotiabank’s Ms Schindler said. Mr Ellison had bid for TikTok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Mr Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC’s request for comment. Mr Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would’ve seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the US, avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration’s attempt to ban TikTok in the US fell through in the face of legal challenges. Mr Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Mr Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. ″[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate,” Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Mr Musk and Mr Ellison leading the pack. According to a National Public Radio report on Saturday, the Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that would involve Oracle and a group of outside investors effectively taking control of it global operations. California-based artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid for TikTok to ByteDance on January 18, as it seeks to create a new merged entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US and new capital partners, CNBC learned. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a TikTok deal structure, the AI company revised its merger proposal on Sunday to also allow for the US government to own up to 50 per cent of the new company upon future IPO, according to a proposal document seen by CNBC. The document proposes ByteDance offer TikTok US, without its recommendation algorithm, in exchange for the company’s existing investors receiving equity in the merged company. The deal would reportedly bring more video to Perplexity — recently valued at about $US9 billion ($14.3b) — as it gains increasing investor interest amid the generative AI boom and competes with OpenAI and Google. Experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it’s unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. “While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $US40b-$US80b, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money,” he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America’s largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Mr Musk’s X. Meta and Google didn’t immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Mr Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Ms Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok’s parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the US platform by investing in the new entity. “Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base,” said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won’t be a problem. The fervour surrounding a purchase of TikTok US has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Mr Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Mr Donaldson, told CNBC that: “Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them.” Led by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O’Leary, The People’s Bid for TikTok, has made a $US20b cash offer to buy TikTok. Mr O’Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won’t include TikTok’s original algorithm. The organisation said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok US. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a 50 per cent stake in the platform, both Mr McCourt and Mr O’Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Mr Trump to make it happen. Mr McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralised social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a non-profit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Mr Trump’s executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling to uphold the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and could face legal opposition. Mr O’Leary also told CNBC last Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Act on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Mr Trump regarding trade with the US is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. “In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump administration and Beijing it’s clear TikTok is a big chip on the table,” Wedush said.

Guest host David Asman said, “I heard a figure 70% of Palisades residents would not return after the fires there. What does that mean for the county?” Altman said, Yeah, David, thanks for having me again. I want to preface that statement and explain it a little bit. They’re not gonna not return because they don’t want to return. Of course, they want to go back there.

Except Trump said every single person he talked to in Pacific Palisades not only wanted to build back, not only wanted to stay there and go nowhere else.....but they were ready to build back tomorrow. That’s why he and the mayor got into it. The residents want to begin clearing their lots now and don’t want any red tape. They want their new houses built now. And they have the money to do it.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Forecasts $700K Bitcoin Price Amid Inflation Worries

EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has suggested that Bitcoin could reach $700,000 per coin, citing its growing role as a hedge against economic instability. His projection, sparked by a discussion with a sovereign wealth fund, highlights the increasing momentum of institutional adoption and its potential to reshape market dynamics. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently speculated that Bitcoin could potentially reach valuations as high as $700,000 per BTC. This projection arises against the backdrop of intensifying concerns about currency debasement and global economic instability, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems. Fink’s remark was not an outright endorsement but rather a reflection on a recent meeting he had with a sovereign wealth fund. The fund sought advice from Larry Fink on whether to allocate 2% or 5% of its investment portfolio to Bitcoin. According to Fink, if institutional adoption continues to grow and similar allocation strategies are embraced broadly, market dynamics could drive Bitcoin to such remarkable heights. Fink made this striking statement during a recent interview, explaining that Bitcoin’s potential for exponential growth is closely tied to fears of economic downturns and fiat currency devaluation. Fink described Bitcoin as an “international instrument” capable of mitigating localized economic fears. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says Bitcoin could go up to $700,000 if there is more fear of currency debasement and economic instability.pic.twitter.com/WOXclAsjDP With BlackRock managing $11.5 trillion in assets, Larry Fink’s words carry significant weight, sending a clear message to retail and institutional investors alike. His endorsement transcends personal opinion, serving as a market signal about Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Long heralded as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is seen as a store of value that can protect wealth from inflation and governmental fiscal mismanagement. Fink’s recognition of this narrative could further accelerate its adoption among traditional investors. Larry Fink’s prediction comes as global economies grapple with soaring inflation, escalating national debts, and geopolitical tensions that threaten currency stability. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins and decentralized structure, presents an alternative asset class that is immune to the inflationary pressures inherent in fiat currencies. In this climate, its value proposition becomes increasingly compelling. BLACKROCK IS BACK.THEY JUST BOUGHT $600 MILLION OF BITCOIN, THEIR LARGEST BUY SO FAR THIS YEAR. pic.twitter.com/QLAm5eaik4 BlackRock’s deepening involvement in Bitcoin reached a milestone on January 21, 2025, when the firm purchased $662 million worth of Bitcoin for its exchange-traded fund (ETF), their largest daily purchase so far this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) surpassed the firm’s iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in net assets in October 2024. This milestone was achieved just months after IBIT’s launch in January 2024, highlighting the rapid growth and increasing investor interest in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds led by Larry Fink. While Larry Fink’s projection is undeniably bullish, it remains contingent on the continuation of current economic trends. If global economic stability improves or innovative financial systems emerge to alleviate fears of currency debasement, Bitcoin’s price trajectory may stabilize at a lower level. Nevertheless, Fink’s high-profile commentary underscores its growing role as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial instrument is accelerating. Fink’s remarks may signal a pivotal moment, not just for Bitcoin, but for its broader acceptance in traditional finance. For investors and enthusiasts, this is more than a vote of confidence—it’s a sign that the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape is not only imminent but already underway. As the world watches, Larry Fink’s prediction about Bitcoin’s role in redefining finance continues to grow. Fink’s prediction serves as a reminder that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a crucial player in the future of money.

Title: Dublin’s new bus routes: How will your service be affected?

Time Published: 2025-01-26T20:30:22Z
Full Content:
A total of 13 new bus services have launched across Dublin and its surrounding areas as part of the latest phase of the National Transport Authority’s BusConnects redesign. The new lines, which began operating on Sunday and include two 24-hour north-south routes, serve communities between Dublin Airport, north Dublin, the city centre, south Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and north Wicklow. Overall bus service levels in all these areas are set to increase by 7 per cent, according to the NTA. The new spine E1 and E2 routes, which run around the clock, bring to 12 the number of 24-hour bus services in Dublin’s bus network. The two new routes also provide access to third-level colleges, including UCD, TCD, DCU and TUD, and hospitals like the Mater, the Rotunda, Temple Street and Loughlinstown. The E1 bus will depart from Northwood in Santry, taking passengers via DCU and the city centre before heading out the N11 to complete its journey at Ballywaltrim in Bray. [ How are you affected by new services replacing 46A and others? Tell us about your experience Opens in new window ] The E2 will depart from Harristown, near Dublin Airport, travel via DCU and the city centre, before heading down the N11 and completing its journey in Dún Laoghaire. The new 19 radial route, which runs from Dublin Airport, through Drumcondra and on to the centre of Dublin, offers direct connections from areas including Glasnevin and Ballymun to the airport for the first time. The 19 will initially terminate in Parnell Square, with three weekday morning peak services running to Merrion Square and three weekday evening peak services running from Merrion Square. Additional services to and from Merrion Square will be introduced from February 4th and services will run daylong to and from Merrion Square from April. The latest phase of BusConnects also includes the introduction of eight new local routes. Two new express (X) routes have also launched in this latest phase. The X1 runs from Kilcoole via Greystones to Hawkins Street in the city centre, while the X2 runs from Newcastle via Kilcoole, Greystones, Brides Glen before also terminating on Hawkins Street. The new services replace the following lines which have now ceased to operate: 46a, 46e, 63, 63a, 84, 84a, 84x, 143, 144, 145, 155, 184 and 185. Most customers of the famous 46A bus route, which ceased operations on Saturday after 99 years’ service, will turn to the new E2 service for transport through the capital city. However, none of the new lines directly replaces previous services but they offer a more “connected, accessible and reliable public transport system” which ensures more “choice and flexibility”, the NTA said.

Send an email to Rob. President Donald Trump appointed Andrew Puzder ambassador to the European Union this past week. But before he heads to Brussels, Puzder is warning about the left-wing scourge of stakeholder capitalism. As the former chief executive of CKE Restaurants, a major fast food corporation operating Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, Puzder knows what it takes to run a successful business. That’s why he’s so alarmed at the trends he’s witnessing in corporate America. Puzder spoke to The Daily Signal about his new book, “A Tyranny for the Good of its Victims: The Ugly Truth about Stakeholder Capitalism.” “Why would family-friendly brands like Disney or Target or a brand like Anheuser-Busch that’s trying to appeal to beer-drinking guys … advance the transgender agenda?” Puzder said. “It just doesn’t make any sense. Or why would ExxonMobil and Chevron adopt net-zero carbon emissions policies when the product that justifies their existence, their most profitable product, is gas and oil?” “It’s because there really is a group of financial elites, people who run these large asset management firms who are trying to impose this leftist, radical, woke cultural agenda on America—on us.” Puzder pointed to three firms in particular: “BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—and add them together, they are the largest shareholder in about 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.” He explained, “This is a very powerful voting block, which really can direct how these companies go and indirectly how our economy goes, and by proxy, all of us. That affects everybody.” Even though the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda appears to be in retreat, Puzder warned that consumers still need to be on guard. He pointed to activist Robby Starbuck’s recent success as an example of how Americans could fight back. “The Left certainly is very good at patronizing companies that support their values,” Puzder said. “On the Right, we need to be just as good or better, and sometimes that’ll cause a little pain, but I think we need to let these companies know what we think.” In the interview, we also cover: Purchase your copy of “A Tyranny for the Good of Its Victims.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low.

“Dad was very affectionate and, unlike many men of his generation, there would be public displays of affection…hugs and kisses on the street” Patrick Cole with his late dad Paddy Paddy with some of his grandchildren Paddy Cole and his wife Helen Cole Paddy with ‘Big Tom’ MacBride Paddy in action playing his saxaphone Paddy never let his illness stop him enjoying life. Seen here with his granddaughter Jamie When showband legend Paddy Cole’s funeral takes place tomorrow in his native Co. Monaghan it will be “a proud ‘Blaney man coming home,” his son Pat said yesterday. Father-of-three Paddy Cole, who turned 85 in December, died last Wednesday afternoon in Dublin’s St Vincent’s Private Hospital following a three-year battle with incurable lung cancer. Paddy’s son, Pat, yesterday shared memories of his famous father, who was one of the best-loved entertainers in Ireland, revealing how he revelled in family life. “Dad was very affectionate and, unlike many men of his generation, there would be public displays of affection…hugs and kisses on the street,” Pat told the Sunday World. Paddy with some of his grandchildren “I’m living in Dublin and my siblings, Pearse and Karen, are abroad, and every Saturday my son, Patrick, myself and Dad – three generations of Patrick Coles – would meet up together for coffee. “And that was a ritual that was protected. Family was very important to him. He has a clatter of sisters up in Castleblayney that he has always stayed close to. So he has kind of been the big brother there. “Then there are the grandchildren…we have four, my brother has two and my sister has three, so plenty of grandchildren. When the kids were smaller he was a nightmare because he’d come to the house with pockets full of sweets and wind them up to high doh. They’d be bouncing off the walls and he’d go, ‘Right, I’m away…’ Paddy Cole and his wife Helen Cole “He loved them dearly and was immensely proud of them. My daughter, Ruby, plays the flute and used to play with Dad in the church in Beechwood (Ranelagh) on Christmas Eve every year, with Julian Vignoles and Ciaran Tourish. He’d get all the kids up on the altar and rattle out a few tunes. The number of people who told me in the last few days that that was a highlight for them... “Ruby is going to sing a piece at Dad’s funeral. The grandchildren are all cut up, but they also feel grateful and lucky that they got to spend a lot of time with him. For people who lose grandparents early you don’t have the sense of who they were. They are constantly surprised when the pictures from his time in Vegas bubble up and they see him with the likes of Muhammad Ali and movie stars.” What was it like growing up with a famous father? Pat says: “Everyone knew him and when we were out with him as kids we would say it was better to have two of us with him because you knew you weren’t going to get to talk to him, you’d have people coming up to him saying, ‘I used to dance to you in Buncrana,’ or ‘I was dancing to you in the Sixties, do you remember me?’ “But he loved all those interactions. He invariably did make some connection with them…’that was a draughty hall’ or ‘the fella that ran that ballroom was a torture to get paid’…and they’d all laugh about whoever that fella was. “He kind of traded on positive energy and he would have gotten energy back from all of those interactions as well. So both the people that came up to him and Dad got a buzz and a bounce out of all of those connections. Paddy never let his illness stop him enjoying life. Seen here with his granddaughter Jamie “Dad wouldn’t want to get into any gossip or negative kind of chat. There was nothing to be gained from that. And even when he got the cancer diagnosis in 2022, that was a real setback, but he had a positive outlook…here’s what I can control and I’m going to keep going forward. “He did like the Clint Eastwood philosophy of “don’t let the old man in.” So it was stay active, stay busy, be useful. He was flying for a full 85 years. “We were in the hospice in Blackrock and they said to him, ‘oh, you had a birthday recently, 85,’ And he said “yeah, a number I only ever thought I’d see above a door.” “He had a positive ritual of getting out, getting his walk, getting the paper, meeting loads of friends for coffee, people like (comedian) Noel V Ginnity and (singer and promoter) George Hunter. He had different gangs he would meet. Paddy in action playing his saxaphone “There were old pals he’d meet on a Saturday morning and then he’d meet me after that. And I’d ask him, ‘Any new stories?’ He’d say, ‘Sure there’s never any new stories. Sure it’s just a group of deaf fellas waiting their turn to tell their story.’” Pat, who has a brother, Pearse, and sister, Karen – all are in their 50s – tells how their mother and father were united to the end and nothing was left unsaid. “It was kind of beautiful when I was bringing Mum out to the hospital to see the two of them together…and it was poignant, of course,” he says. “This time next month they would have been 60 years married. Mum is doing pretty well, as well as can be expected. When some time ago Mum had a fall and suffered broken bones the running joke in the house was, ‘Dad, sorry, you’re the terminal cancer patient, but you’re not patient number one in the house at this point.’ “He was then looking after Mum and that probably kept him going as well on a level.” Was he accepting of his terminal cancer diagnosis? “Yeah, there was nothing left undone, himself and Mum had had all the conversations. They had a rich life together,” Pat says. “It wasn’t the type of lung cancer that smokers get. It was the lining of the lung wall. The first doctor who diagnosed it asked, ‘did you work with asbestos all your life?’ Dad couldn’t figure that out, he thought it might have been how the dance halls were constructed back then. “But he got three years and maybe that was his lung capacity from blowing the sax all his life. He kept going and with his humorous take he used to say, ‘People are telling me I’m a miracle man. Sure that’s no good to me, they’re telling me, basically, that I should be dead already.’” Paddy with ‘Big Tom’ MacBride Pat told how his father was very proud of being honoured with a two-storey mural in his native Castleblaney in 2019. “Himself and Big Tom got the freedom of the town,” he says. “It’s great that Castleblaney honoured Dad when he was alive, so we had that big event and then the mural went up on the wall in Lakeview opposite where Dad grew up, where my granny used to live. “On Monday we’ll do a pause at the mural before we move to the church. It’s a proud ‘Blaney man coming home. “I don’t think Dad was an enigma to people. The bubbly, effervescent, high-energy, high-octave guy that people met on the street is exactly who he was. So he ran at that speed. “We thought he had limitless energy, we thought he’d go forever. I think he gave it a good run for the three years, so he wasn’t going gently into that good night.” Paddy Cole’s remains will be reposing at Fanagans Funeral Home, Rathfarnham, Dublin, today from 2pm to 5pm. The removal will be tomorrow morning to St. Mary’s Church, Castleblayney, arriving for a 12 noon funeral Mass, followed by a private cremation.

Yes. It’s still going on. Never-ending January continues, as we await the first post-Christmas pay cheque and the days to lengthen gradually into brightness. Restaurants across the city know that we particularly appreciate a bargain around now, and they equally want our custom at this quieter time. Here are some of the best offers currently running in the city from places new and old. So go on, grab your friends or family, try somewhere new or maybe just support your favourite spots. Achara burst on to the scene last year with bold, grilled Thai flavours that immediately had us all coming back for more. They offer €15 lunch special dishes, or their family-style early bird menu is available Monday-Friday, 5pm-6.30pm costing €25 per person with choices of basil chilli aubergine or Wagyu basil chilli beef krapao. Read our full review here Chef Gaz Smith is a feeder who loves nothing more than to see diners enjoying themselves over seafood and steak dishes. Recently, Big Mike’s launched a €22 “plat du jour” available every Friday and Saturday at lunchtime. Past offerings include roast duck ragù with taglierini, free-range pork schnitzel and hanger steak with chimichurri. What better way to kick start the weekend? Sometimes it’s not about special deals and offers. Sometimes a place simply does good value all the time. The weekday lunchtime menu at this smart pub has double smash burgers for €13 or steak frites with Irish rump steak for €16, while their loaded weekend roasts cost just €22. If you want Korean-style fried chicken, it’s hard to beat Chimac. They use only Irish free-range chicken in their addictively tasty dishes while their loaded fries and poutine round out the meal. A range of sauces, including the lip-smacking sriracha caramel, is available online and in selected stockists. Wednesdays in January and February give diners the chance to enjoy bottomless wings over 90 minutes for just €17.50. Read our full review here Serving big steaks in a stunning diningroom, it’s easy to think that a meal at Hawksmoor will put a big dent in your wallet. However, they’ve consistently offered set value lunches and specials that are much more pocket-friendly. January offers a rump steak lunch with a side dish for €23 (Monday-Thursday, 12pm-5pm). The long-running express lunch menu has two or three courses for €31/€35 (Monday-Thursday, 12pm-3pm and 5pm-6pm; and Friday-Saturday, 12pm-6pm) while the BYOB Monday wine club offers €5 corkage all day. Read our full review here Dublin’s Liberties got the Big Romance treatment when the spacious old Clock pub closed, to be reopened as a modern bar with craft beer, cocktails and a custom Hatchett sound system. For food, they turned to the mother and son team of Maribel and Julian Trejo, better known as El Milagro, who serve up their Mexican bites every day except Monday. Taco Tuesdays sees the great value offer of three taquitos for €10, accompanied by two-for-one margaritas. Vamos! Sister and brother team Brid and Colm Carter are the people behind H2G wines, an independent wine importer and wholesaler. Following a long stint at the now closed Honest2Goodness market in Glasnevin, they opened Mosaic, a local store that doubles as a wine bar with small plates. Until the end of February, customers can enjoy free corkage on Wednesdays and Thursdays, perfect for a midweek treat. Ever since eschewing a Michelin star, chef Oliver Dunne has focused on building up a busy restaurant group that consistently offers good value. They’ve just announced Restaurant Week which will run from January 27th to February 2nd, and will see all restaurants in the group (Pink Restaurant, Cleaver East, One Ballsbridge Bar & Restaurant, Bon Appetit, Ribeye Steakhouse and Social Bar & Restaurant) offer a three-course menu for €35, all night, every night. Having served more than one million pizzas in five locations across Ireland and Scotland since opening in 2018, Sano has built a reputation for high quality and affordable Neapolitan pizzas. Early bird vouchers are available to purchase online for €20, which cover a pizza (excluding specials), a bottle of beer or glass of wine, and an ice-cream or tiramisu. The voucher is valid for use in all Irish locations Monday-Thursday from 2pm-6pm. Read our full review here The spacious and elegant Dunmore has a neighbourhood menu which offers two or three courses for €31/€35, Tuesday-Thursday from 5pm-6.30pm. With a family connection to the lovely Strand Inn in Dunmore East, it’s no surprise to see good seafood options on the menu. Choose from Duncannon Quay mussels, the warming seafood pie or fire-roasted guinea fowl. Read our full review here For a Sunday treat, grab a gang and head to Ranelagh for the Exchequer’s hearty roast. Each meal serves four people and includes all trimmings plus a bottle of house wine. Prices start at €84.95 for chicken, while beef rib costs €99.95 and a whole suckling pig option is also available. Roasts must be ordered two days in advance (a week for the suckling pig), but that’s the only hard work needed as chef José and team will take care of everything else. Known for its glamorous interior, The Ivy is offering seriously good value on wine right now with half price on all bottles every Wednesday-Friday this January. There are no catches, with all wines included. Combine with the January set menu which has one or two courses for €23.95/€29.95 on Monday-Friday from 11.30am-6pm. Located right underneath the ground floor grocery, the Wine Cellar at Fallon & Byrne is one of the cosiest spots in Dublin for a platter of cheese, charcuterie and a glass of wine. On Sundays-Tuesdays, you can choose any wine from the extensive collection lining the walls and enjoy for just €1 corkage. Following the closure of the much-missed Headline bar, veteran restaurateurs Máire and Geoff Ní Mhaoile relocated to Terenure and promptly set about creating yet another neighbourhood treasure. Their warm hospitality and focus on getting the basics right has seen them build a strong local following, and now they are offering their two-course, €34 early bird menu all day every Friday and Saturday. Read our full review here Yves returns to Ranelagh on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays with a French-influenced set-price sharing menu for €37.95. Mix and match dishes such as gravlax, potato bombs with beef bourguignon ragù or slow roast pork belly with lentils, and enjoy with free corkage throughout January and February – especially with the excellent Redmonds off-licence next door. Read our full review here And finally for something a little different, website earlytable.ie is a restaurant booking platform that offers up to 50 per cent off food at a wide range of places. Restaurants offer discounts on tables at quieter, and not so quiet, times, while diners use pre-purchased credits, starting from as little as €1, to reserve tables. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘It was glamorous, and we thought it would last forever’ – curtain falls on Paddy Cole, king of the swingers

From hanging with Elvis to dodging Roy Rogers’ calls, the seasoned saxophonist’s life was simply epic Showband legend Paddy Cole Helen and Paddy Cole Paddy Cole and Butch Moore Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal In April 2022, before the funeral of Dickie Rock’s wife Judy in Rathfarnham, Paddy Cole told me he had just been diagnosed with incurable lung cancer. He battled it with bravery and courage for the best part of three years, succumbing last week at the age of 85. Cole was a legend in the Irish entertainment industry and one of the country’s most respected musicians. His professional career playing Dixieland jazz began at the age of 12 in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and lasted until his cancer diagnosis. He also gave rise to one of the great anecdotes in Irish showbusiness, first told by Kevin Marron in the Sunday World. While doing a residency in Las Vegas, members of his band, the Big 8 showband, became friendly with their boyhood hero, Roy Rogers — a famous TV cowboy with a horse called Trigger. One night, Rogers had gone to their gig, and was so taken with the band that he invited them to his ranch. In time, the friendship became slightly irksome for the Irish band — and Marron was in Paddy’s apartment for dinner when the phone rang. As his wife Helen went to answer it, Paddy shouted: “If that’s Roy Rogers, tell him I’m not in.” The anecdote gave rise to the title of a biography of Cole by journalist Tim Ryan. Paddy was a very decent man with an easy charm and ready smile, who formed friendships all over the world, from celebrities and VIPs to ordinary folk who admired him for his expertise on the saxophone and clarinet and his genuine love of life and music. He also engaged in many charitable enterprises and was voluntary chairman of the royalty-collection agency Recorded Artists, Actors and Performers (RAAP), as well as presenting a well-received weekly radio programme on Sunshine FM. In an RTÉ recording of Open House, singer Joe Dolan summed him up: “I’ve never heard Paddy say anything rude about anybody or talk behind anyone’s back… he’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime.” He’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime Paddy Cole was born into a musical family in Henry Street, Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, on December 17, 1939, the second in a family of seven children. His father, also Paddy, worked for the post office and played saxophone with the local Regal Dance Band and later the Maurice Lynch Orchestra. “I often think back about my dad and I admire him a lot for working day and night,” he said in his autobiography, King of the Swingers, written with Tom Gilmore. “He was with the post office, driving a mail van, delivering letters and parcels to sub-post offices every morning, as well as being a musician by night.” Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row His mother, Mary Hughes, also from a musical family in Castleblayney, was the mainstay of the family and encouraged her son from an early age. Listening to old 78rpm records on the gramophone, he became a fan of New Orleans jazz – something that would last his lifetime and make him a handsome living. Billed as “12-year-old Paddy Cole, Ireland’s youngest saxophone player”, he played his first professional gig with his father in Maurice Lynch’s band, just on the cusp of what became known as the showband era. While still at vocational school in Castleblayney, he rushed from classes to the band’s van waiting outside the school gates, collecting him for gigs. “We were doing a cross-section of everything — a variety of music to suit all tastes,” he said, from Bill Haley’s Rock Around The Clock to Irish ballads and Glenn Miller dance tunes. But there was also pressure on him to get a steady job, in case the music didn’t work out. He worked as a petrol-pump attendant, an apprentice electrician and a butcher. But the music of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and others held him in thrall. With the advent of the showband boom and the money that it brought to rural Ireland, there was a demand for good musicians. Two young agriculture students, Eamonn Monaghan and Des Kelly, had formed the Capitol Showband, and in 1961 they came calling on Cole, with an offer of £30 a week. Paddy shrugged off obscurity to play all over the country in parish halls and the new ballrooms that were springing up. “It was glamorous, and we were enjoying it all, even if we weren’t that conscious of how good the music was. We thought it would go on forever,” he said. His first gig with the Capitol was at the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, Co Louth. “It was so hectic in those early days with the Capitol that there wasn’t even time to think,” he said. There were concerts all over Ireland and Britain, some before crowds of 4,000 people. The band did a programme on Radio Luxembourg, and recorded with Phil Coulter at the Tommy Ellis Studio in Dublin, and did publicity work for newspapers and magazines. Their big break came when Belfast-born promoter Phil Solomon brought the band to London to record Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a huge televised variety show with an audience of millions. Solomon, who also recorded Van Morrison and The Dubliners, wanted the Capitol to be the show’s house band — and was miffed when they turned it down. They were also the first Irish showband to go to the US, in 1961, at a time when there was no music or dancing during the Catholic season of Lent in De Valera’s Ireland. The band had three number one hits in 1964-65 with Down Came the Rain, Born to Be with You and Walking the Streets in the Rain, which had been Ireland’s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, sung by Butch Moore. Helen and Paddy Cole While playing a dance in Newcastle West, Paddy met a “fabulous-looking girl” – who a week or two later, he spotted walking along Westmoreland Street in Dublin. She was Helen Hehir. The couple married in February 1965, but had to cut their honeymoon in Marbella short when Paddy got a call to get over to London to record for The Eamonn Andrews Show and Thank Your Lucky Stars. When Butch Moore got an offer “he couldn’t refuse” and left the Capitol, the showband scene was coming to an end. Paddy Cole got a phone call to see if he would join the Big 8 with Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy. The Big 8 spent six months of the year doing a Las Vegas residency at the Stardust. “It was hard work,” he told Tom Gilmore for King of the Swingers. “We were doing three shows a night, six nights a week and each show was an hour long.” But there was time off too, and Paddy recalled meeting Elvis Presley and attending Frank Sinatra’s legendary concerts in Caesars Palace. Although they loved the lifestyle and climate of Nevada, the Coles returned to Ireland in 1974 and Paddy decided to leave the Big 8 — announcing it through the pages of the Evening Press, much to the annoyance of band leaders Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy, and of manager TJ Byrne. Cole, who had been teetotal in the early years, started “drinking a few bottles of Guinness” after shows, which became more than a few bottles as time wore on. He admitted to Gilmore that he was at this stage “a bad drinker”, ending up after gigs drinking late into the night with people he didn’t know, asking himself the following morning why he was doing it. After he had some nodules removed from his throat, he was told by his surgeon not to drink alcohol for five weeks — and he never did. “It was no big deal,” he once told me, “I never went to AA meetings or anything like that. But to be honest, it was then I realised that people attending my gigs were buying me so many pints… "While it was my policy never to drink before going on stage, I felt at the jazz gigs that I had to have a pint from time to time. But I never drank after that cancer scare, and it changed my life.” After stints with the Paddy Cole Band and the Paddy Cole Superstars, he bought a pub in Castleblayney, named it Paddy Cole’s Place — and moved home. Due to back trouble he had to stop performing, and was eventually “sacked” from his own band and given a sinecure working in the office. He credited the singer Twink with “bushwhacking” him into cabaret and after that he became a staple on the scene, playing with her on stage and television shows. Reunion tours with the Capitol, The Showband Show and cabaret gigs at Clontarf Castle, the Braemor Rooms, the Harcourt Hotel plus gigs all over the country, kept him busy as a musician for the rest of his life. After selling the pub, the Coles moved to a Victorian home in Ballsbridge, Dublin. Like many musicians he suffered from financial insecurity, which led in 2006 to him making a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for €834,726 in relation to off-shore bank accounts — probably the one embarrassing blot on his long career in showbusiness. Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal While not playing music, Cole was a keen golfer and member of the prestigious Lahinch Golf Club in Co Clare. “I cringe when I hear that word ‘retirement’,” he told one interviewer. “I want to ease back a bit and pick and choose where and when I’ll play. But there’s an old saying: ‘You don’t stop because you get old; but you get old because you stop’ — and that’s why I won’t be stopping.” He put it another way to an old showbusiness acquaintance. “When you have somebody offering you €5,000 for a couple of hours’ work doing something you really love, you’d be stone mad to say no.” Sadly, when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, he had to stop. One of his great regrets was no longer being able to play sax or clarinet. But he faced his illness with his usual grace, joking from his hospital bed that there was so much fluid on his lungs that “I need a plumber, not a surgeon.” One of his favourite haunts was Gleesons pub in Booterstown, Co Dublin, where he would meet with friends for coffee, particularly Éanna Casey who worked with him in the musician’s royalty organisations RAAP. Among his many lifelong pals were musician Eamonn Monaghan and comedian Noel V Ginnity and a host of others, including businessman Mick Sherry who drove him to and from hospital appointments. Paddy Cole, who died last Wednesday, is survived by his wife Helen and children Karen, Paddy and Pierce. His funeral mass takes place in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, at 12 noon tomorrow.

Title: Davos calls for cooperation amid global challenges

People attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 23, 2025. (Xinhua/Lian Yi) Amid uncertainties, cooperation remains essential to advancing global economy and WEF participants have expressed optimism about China's economic prospects and contribution to driving global recovery. DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- In the face of global uncertainties, cooperation remains essential to advance the global economy and foster sustainable growth, said participants at the five-day World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting, which concluded on Friday in Davos, Switzerland. China's steady economic growth, marked by a 5 percent increase in 2024, has provided significant momentum to the global economy. WEF participants expressed confidence and optimism regarding China's economic prospects and contributions to global economic recovery. UNCERTAINTIES AHEAD While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slightly revised its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 3.3 percent, uncertainties and uneven growth remain key concerns. During the annual meeting, politicians, leaders of international organizations, and business executives warned that protectionism and decoupling could severely undermine global economic growth and prosperity. Trade protectionism has begun to resurge, Fred Hu, founder and chairman of Primavera Capital Group, told Xinhua during the WEF annual meeting, adding that it once triggered a global economic depression. "Historical lessons have fully demonstrated that the path of protectionism is not sustainable," Hu said. Voicing strong opposition to protectionism, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, said, "This will not really benefit anyone." The WEF's Chief Economists Outlook report, released before the opening of the annual meeting, revealed that more than half of surveyed economists expect the global economy to weaken over the next year. Their concerns stem from growing trade protectionism, global economic fragmentation, public debt and persistently high inflation. Rising unilateralism and protectionism are intensifying geopolitical and economic fragmentation, while trade enhances the efficiency and dynamism of the global economy. The strain on multilateralism makes effective global cooperation more urgent than ever.

(Xinhua/Peng Ziyang) GLOBAL COOPERATION In his closing remarks, WEF President Borge Brende said the world is at a time of immense consequence and uncertainty. "Political, geopolitical, and macroeconomic landscape -- all are shifting under our feet," he said. Critical priorities such as driving economic growth, reducing carbon emissions, and finding ways to end conflicts require urgent attention, he said. "All of these challenges cannot wait, and the only way to make progress on these issues is by working together." "Prosperity is indivisible. I can't prosper unless you are prospering," Singaporean President Tharman Shanmugaratnam said at the "Global Economic Outlook" session on Friday. "No nation, even the largest, will prosper unless the rest of the world is prospering," he said. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also highlighted that the evolving geopolitical landscape will reshape trade and economic relations, leading to more regional cooperation and supply chain-based collaboration. "I think there is no way we can wipe out collaboration from the future of humanity," she said. "Advancing global innovation, health, prosperity and resilience cannot be done alone. Leaders will need new mechanisms for working together on key priorities, even as they disagree on others, and the past several years have shown this balance is possible," said Bob Sternfels, global managing partner of McKinsey.

(Photo by Geng Yuhe/Xinhua) CHINA'S CONTRIBUTIONS China's economic development garnered significant attention at the annual meeting, with participants expressing confidence in its growth prospects. Hu noted that China's economic fundamentals are constantly improving and China's capital market is full of opportunities. Though China's economy faces challenges in the short term, it still has many bright spots in the fields of manufacturing, new energy industry, consumer spending and technological innovation, he said. China's high-quality economic development over the past few decades has injected momentum into global economic growth, and China will continue to be an "important engine" for driving global economic growth in the future, Hu said. Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey & Company in Greater China, reaffirmed his confidence in China's economic fundamentals, describing the market as "full of opportunities and worthy of investment by global companies." China's advancements in technology, including its rapid progress in artificial intelligence, drew widespread attention at the annual meeting. Chen Liming, chair of Greater China for the WEF, highlighted China's contributions to global AI governance and its active collaboration with international organizations to share insights and foster cooperation. "If you look at China, its entrepreneurialism, its development, Europe needs to be in the same footing," said Laurence Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock, an asset management firm.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks. Even though the year 2024 was not kind to certain sectors within the US economy, the broader outlook for the stock market heading into the new year was more than rosy. Investment banks generally anticipated moderate economic growth for the US in 2025. For example, Deutsche Bank forecasts a growth rate of approximately 2%, noting that 2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's Global Investment Strategy team emphasized a foundation of strength stemming from 2024's robust market returns. They highlighted themes such as easing global policies and rising capital investment as key drivers for the coming year. Their report, Outlook 2025: Building on Strength, suggested that the US economy was well-positioned to capitalize on these favorable conditions. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, inflation remained a focal point in economic discussions. Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.

A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Decline in Share Price Over Past 12 Months: 27.6% Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a diversified software company worldwide. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. Firstly, the company’s robust financial performance and its ability to grow revenue and deliver solid profitability are reflected in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, Adobe achieved revenue of $21.51 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency. Diluted earnings per share was $12.36 on a GAAP basis and $18.42 on a non-GAAP basis. Secondly, the company has teamed up with artist and culinary author Benny Blanco to create a collection of customizable marketing templates for Adobe Express, the company’s powerful yet user-friendly design app. This collaboration aims to empower small businesses, including restaurants, to easily create eye-catching content that stands out both online and in person. Moreover, the company has launched Adobe GenStudio, which would drive customer engagement, personalization and conversion. Overall ADBE ranks 1st on our list of the stocks to buy in falling markets now.

Ethereum (ETH) declined by 5.68% in the last week in line with the majority of the crypto market. The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Title: BlackRock Files To Change Its Bitcoin ETF To Allow For In-Kind Redemptions — Good News For BTC?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-files-to-change-its-bitcoin-etf-to-allow-for-in-kind-redemptions-good-news-for-btc/
Time Published: 2025-01-25T20:38:15Z
Full Content:
Asset management giant BlackRock is pushing for a significant update to its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, to allow in-kind redemptions rather than just for cash. Authorized participants, aka large institutional investors, would be able to buy and redeem shares of the ETF directly in Bitcoin. This model is deemed more efficient as it lets authorized participants closely observe the demand for the fund and act swiftly by buying or selling shares of the ETF without being obliged to sell the BTC through a market maker and deliver cash. Initially, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT with cash-only redemption, but this proposed update reflects a move toward bigger integration of Bitcoin in institutional ETF operations. “It should have been approved in the first place, but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart observed on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” According to a Jan. 24 amended rule filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nasdaq proposed “to allow for in-kind transfers of the Trust’s Bitcoin.” This in-kind model is more efficient for ETFs as it avoids bid spreads and broker commissions from selling the basket to raise cash for issuing shares. Notably, retail investors won’t have access to the in-kind redemption model as they will only be eligible to participate in the cash model. Only authorized participants willl be able to do in-kind redemptions and creations. “The main point is that the in-kind model is way more streamlined with less steps and less parties involved (and its how the vast majority of ETFs operate),” Seyffart explained. BlackRock now holds an astounding $60 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in its iShares Bitcoin Trust, an impressive feat reached just one year after going live on Wall Street. This represents about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin has positioned it among the biggest institutional holders of the premier cryptocurrency, even usurping MicroStrategy’s well-known cache. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also recently sparked excitement among market participants after speculating a BTC price target of as high as $700,000 if more institutions adopt it. He has been talking with sovereign wealth funds about allocating 2% to 5% of their assets to Bitcoin, which indicates that even entities that usually avoid risk are becoming interested amid President Donald Trump’s return to the White House for his second term.

Title: No more number 13 bus to Ballymun as route set to end at Mountjoy Square

Another recognisable Dublin bus route, the number 13 serving Ballymun, will change this weekend, when bus services in the north Dublin suburb are taken over by routes under the Bus Connects network. Route 13 has had a long association with Ballymun and until Saturday of this week ran between Grange Castle in west Dublin and Harristown, close to Dublin Airport. The last bus into each terminus is scheduled for 11.30pm on Saturday night. From Sunday there will still be a route 13 but its northern terminus is to be Mountjoy Square in Dublin’s north inner city. The route will still connect with Grange Castle via O’Connell Street, the south City, Kimmage, Bluebell and Clondalkin. The changes are part of the introduction this Sunday of phase 6a of the National Transport Authority’s Bus Connects network. Under the plan, Route 13 is to continue in name but the northern leg of the route will be dropped. Ballymun will in future be covered by the Bus Connects E-Spine routes E1 and E2 – which are both 24-hour routes. The E1 runs from Northwood, which is north of Ballymun, taking in DCU and the city centre to Ballywaltrim, which is south of Bray, Co Wicklow. The E2 runs from Harristown near Dublin Airport, taking in DCU, the city centre and terminating in Dún Laoghaire. Two other routes, route 4 and route 11, will also survive the changes, albeit with amendments. From Sunday route 4 from Monkstown will be diverted at O’Connell Bridge to Heuston Station. Route 11 from Sandyford will be diverted at Parnell Square to run via Phibsborough and the North Circular Road to the Phoenix Park. Radial route 19 from Dublin Airport via DCU to the city centre will initially operate to and from Parnell Square, and to and from Merrion Square at peak times. An all-day service to and from Merrion Square will commence in April. Routes being replaced from Sunday as part of phase 6a include the 46A, 46E, 63, 63A, 84, 84A, 84x, 143, 144, 145, 155, 184 and 185. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] Kilcoole and Newcastle in Co Wicklow will in future be served by the X1 and X2 routes, respectively. The service will be between North Wicklow and Dublin city centre. In addition a number of short-hop, local services will be introduced around north Co Wicklow and south Co Dublin feeding into local schools, Dart and Luas lines. These include local routes around Delgany, Enniskerry, Greystones and Bray, some routes within Bray and some routes across south Co Dublin. The L26 will link Kilternan to Cornelscourt and on to Blackrock Dart station; while the L27 will link Leopardstown Valley with Cornelscourt and Dún Laoghaire. A full list of the new services is available at transportforireland.ie. Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Investors shouldn't complain, though, after an action-packed start to the week led the coin to hit a new high. The price of the biggest coin by market cap broke a new record of $108,786 Monday ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration. It has since dropped by nearly 4%, CoinGecko shows. And despite President Trump not explicitly declaring plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in his first crypto executive order, the coin is still sitting comfortably above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin soared above $100,000 following Trump's November election; the President promised to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry. And he is keeping his crypto promises—albeit while annoying some hardcore Bitcoiners in the process. Money continued to flow into the crypto investment vehicles this week, after investors threw billions at the funds last week ahead of the inauguration. But it didn't stop, with $802.6 million hitting the funds on Tuesday alone, data from Farside Investors shows. By the end of the week, over $1.75 billion worth of assets had entered the Bitcoin ETFs. The bullishness comes as Donald Trump is expected to be a net positive for the industry. The Republican campaigned on a promise to help the industry and now buying Bitcoin has never been easier thanks to the funds. The spot bitcoin ETFs quietly on fire to start year, with $4.2b in flows which is 6% of all ETF flows. Now at +$40b net since launch with aum at $121b and return of 127%. For context they just passed ESG ETFs in assets ($117b) and have about same as gold spot. pic.twitter.com/GADOomLXD4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 24, 2025 Bitcoiners had been waiting for it for years. And on Tuesday, President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of the dark web e-commerce site—mainly used for buying drugs using Bitcoin—was released shortly after and expressed enormous gratitude to President Trump. The crypto community flooded his digital wallets with BTC donations, too. But Ulbricht—who went to prison in 2013—might already just be sitting on a goldmine: Untouched Bitcoin wallets linked to Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road now hold over $47 million worth of the asset. Ulbricht has long been considered a hero in the Bitcoin community for creating one of the first marketplaces to accept the cryptocurrency. And though it still can't be verified that the wallets do indeed belong to him, it's not beyond the realm of possibility. Ahead of Donald Trump's shock November 5 win, the President had promised plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But after signing his first crypto executive order on Thursday, which touched on the possibility of a crypto stockpile, Bitcoiners noticed one thing—there was no mention of their beloved orange coin, just "digital assets." "The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts," the order read. The news has angered ardent Bitcoiners, who have been hurling the usual insults about "shitcoinery," and who think it may lead the government to building up a stash of other digital coins. Emergency Press Conference: Ripple is undermining American prosperity, freedom, and Bitcoin. Ripple is actively lobbying to stop a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. while pushing their centralized, corporate-controlled token. We will not stand for it. pic.twitter.com/EHldJHxyR9 — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) January 24, 2025 Software company MicroStrategy shareholders are seemingly all-in on the firm's Bitcoin strategy: They on Tuesday voted for a 30x increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares so that the company could have more resources to buy the cryptocurrency. The news came as the company announced its latest Bitcoin buy, bringing its holdings to 461,000 Bitcoin—worth over $48 billion. And on Friday, the firm said that it would redeem over $1 billion worth of its existing debt accumulated early while building up the stash. Elsewhere, British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which has come out with very bullish predictions in the past, said in a Wednesday note that Bitcoin would continue to soar as pension funds enter the space. Analysts at the bank forecasted that institutions enthusiasm for the asset could mean the coin hits $200,000 by the end of 2025. But there were even bigger price predictions for Bitcoin from major players this week. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that growing adoption could push the price of the asset to $700,000, while Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong projected a price in the "multiple millions" at some undetermined point in the future.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Building a great investment portfolio and, therefore, wealth takes a lot of patience and time. Portfolios can also take many shapes depending on the investor’s goals and purpose. For some, it’s all about chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which promise quicker returns, while for other investors, it’s about a steadier approach focusing on dividend payments and long-term growth. Both strategies have benefits and again, the right one depends on the investor’s goals, risk appetite and time horizon. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. One investor recently shared his journey and explained how he turned $3.50 per hour investments into a $4.4 million portfolio in over 35 years. While his approach relied heavily on dividends and closed-end funds, a major key to his success involved making bold moves on risky stocks like IMMU (Immunomedics) and SAVA (Cassava Sciences). He held IMMU stocks for decades and sold them at the right time, generating $2.2 million for his portfolio, which shows how long-term strategies and perhaps a bit of luck can pay off big. “Started at $3.50 per hour. Went back to school in my early 30s, as did my wife. Definitely no inheritance and student loans to boot. Just 35 years of investing. [...] Got lucky with IMMU buyout after riding that one (in and out) for ~30 years,” the investor said. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Now, he’s planning on shifting gears to more conservative, balanced, high-yield stocks that pay dividends. With his holdings allocated to 150 different stocks, his top 10 favorites make up 25% of his $300K annual dividends. These picks include a combination of dividend-growth stocks, closed-end funds and high-risk plays and he’s shared them in a thread in Reddit’s r/dividends community. Let’s closely examine his top 10 stock picks and why they appeal to so many investors. Investor With $300K in Dividends and a $4.4 Million Portfolio Shares His Top 10 Stocks BSTZ (BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II) BSTZ is a closed-end fund focusing on tech innovation, such as AI, robotics and biotech. With a current dividend yield of 10.04%, this pick is a favorite among investors who want high yields and seek growth and exposure to advanced industries. JRI (Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund) JRI invests in assets like real estate and infrastructure, offering buyers diversification and a hedge against inflation. With a dividend yield of around 7.89%, JRI charms many investors, especially those close to or already retired and those looking for stability. Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started. DSL (DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund) DSL specializes in global fixed-income securities, such as high-yield bonds and new market debt. Its current dividend yield is 10.17%. Investors buy DSL because of its high dividend rate and diversification across assets. NRO (Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund) Boasting a 10.75% dividend yield, NRO offers access to real estate securities, primarily REITs, which generate returns through property income. KYN (Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund) KYN invests in energy infrastructure acquisitions, including pipelines and storage facilities. With a 9.97% dividend yield, this fund appeals to investors seeking income and exposure to a traditionally high-yielding industry. HIO (Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund) As a high-yield bond fund created for income generation, HIO offers a dividend gain of 9.50% and appeals to investors due to its substantial profits in fixed-income securities. See Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! IDE (Voya Infrastructure, Industrials and Materials Fund) With a dividend yield of 8.94%, IDE specializes in infrastructure and industrial sectors, providing investors with insight into essential services, such as materials and transportation. MO (Altria Group) MO is a leader in the tobacco sector and offers a 9.91% dividend yield. The group has a strong cash flow, is a reliable dividend stock as per investors and is a good choice for many because it offers diversification into alternative products. ARCC (Ares Capital Corporation) ARCC is a business development company that offers financing to mid-sized companies and offers a dividend yield of 9.91%. Investors who want to benefit from the expansion of private companies find ARCC a good buy. HYT (BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund) With dividend returns of 9.43% currently, HYT invests in a portfolio of corporate high-yield bonds.
