Sources familiar with the plan also told Bloomberg that the funding would include federal-private partnerships and possible Department of Energy-led permitting reforms. While exact allocations remain undisclosed as of the time of writing, the package is expected to prioritize regions facing power congestion due to rising AI workloads, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Georgia. According to Axios, over 60 energy and technology CEOs will attend the summit, including representatives from ExxonMobil, Amazon Web Services, Chevron, Palantir, and BlackRock. The initiative comes against a backdrop of mounting strain on U.S. electricity infrastructure, with data centers now among the fastest-growing sources of demand. A Reuters analysis published last week found that demand from AI-driven compute loads is outpacing available generation in key markets. Meta, for example, recently secured 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois under a 20-year agreement. Analysts say Trump’s proposal could redirect investment back toward fossil generation and nuclear while reducing federal support for wind and solar. Bloomberg noted the plan may scale back Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, potentially cutting over 300 gigawatts of future renewable capacity. Critics argue the energy shift could benefit legacy infrastructure at the expense of decarbonization targets. Trump’s announcement also includes a plan to redevelop a former Aliquippa steel mill into a high-density data center complex, according to CBS News. The site would anchor one of several new AI-energy corridors envisioned under the program.

Title: BSGM Partners with CXG to Acquire FINRA/SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer for Real-World Asset Tokenization Expansion

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. BioSig Technologies, an innovative medical device technology company, has announced a collaboration with Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. The move marks a major milestone in the company’s efforts to become one of the first fully regulated Real-World Asset (“RWA”) tokenization companies trading on a major United States exchange, positioning it as the first NASDAQ-listed SEC and FINRA Compliant Issuer of RWA Tokens in the U.S. When the company completes the acquisition of the broker-dealer, it will create an entity with a significant first-mover advantage in the U.S.-major-exchange-traded RWA-backed tokenized investment opportunities for both major institutional and retail investors in the U.S. With this capability, the platform will be able to significantly accelerate adoption and network effect growth of Streamex’s proprietary on-chain RWA commodity market platform. Moreover, the company will be able to continue to seek out other broker-dealer opportunities in other strategically advantageous countries. Following the acquisition, the FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the U.S., will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. BSGM has embarked on the move as its near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for U.S. institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. The acquisition will offer Streamex the opportunity to feature among the first Nasdaq-listed companies to issue regulated, gold-backed RWA tokens. Notably, it is in full compliance with both FINRA and SEC regulations, aligning with emerging U.S. digital asset frameworks. Furthermore, Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain enables fast, low-cost issuance and trading of gold-backed tokens, making gold investment accessible to all, with additional commodities markets to come. Also, Streamex aims to hold significant quantities in vaulted gold by 2026, denominating its balance sheet in physical gold to support a recurring revenue model. Following the acquisition, Streamex positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. The platform will allow investors to buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and U.S. regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and Co-Founder of Streamex, commented on the mov,e saying; “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig…Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the U.S. Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” ”Morgan Lekstrom, Executive Chairman of the Company, also added; “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.”

A renewed move into hard assets echoes past episodes where cracks in sovereign debt markets triggered defensive positioning. Japan’s bond rout may be an early warning of broader fiscal strain. Unrealized losses on Japanese bonds are mounting, with 30-year yields rising to 3.2% on July 15 in levels not seen before, erasing an estimated 45% of their value since 2019, The Kobeissi Letter wrote in an X post on Monday. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has climbed to 235% leaving the Bank of Japan nursing $198 billion in unrealized losses. That erosion of trust in “risk-free” assets is not localized to Japan, but can be seen across other major developed economies. The U.S. 10-year yield has climbed roughly 40 to 60 basis points this year, echoing upward pressure seen in Japan’s bond market. Since the 2020 lows, yields have risen more than fourfold, driven in part by sustained deficit spending and heavy Treasury issuance. “The reality is that global government bond market liquidity is at a record low, now below 2008 levels,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote. “This is exactly why Bitcoin and Gold are surging to record highs.” The flight to hard assets is palpable, former BlackRock executive and XBTO CIO Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, told Decrypt. “Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a macrohedge and structurally scarce asset,” he said. “The next leg up depends on institutional interest deepening as legislative, fiscal, and monetary tailwinds converge." Meanwhile, spot ETF inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared past $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. That comes amid a backdrop of high interest rates, combined with “just-in-case” financing ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Even with a bleak bond market, some say the U.S. economy now resides in a “goldilocks-like equilibrium," further fueling Bitcoin’s rally. A closer examination of the spot order book shows buyers positioning at 2%, 5%, and 10% below market, suggesting dip-buying interest remains intact despite fading momentum. That reflects a shift in investor sentiment, which was previously skewed towards asks in Bitcoin perpetuals a few days earlier. Historical data shows that Bitcoin reacted positively the last time such signals occurred. Bitcoin is down more than 5% from its July 14 record of $123,300, with over $300 million in long positions liquidated over the past 12 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

This has disrupted the global markets and have spread a wave of uncertainties whose chain-effects are clearly visible on the domestic market as well. Moreover, the prolonged geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine continue to act as a deterrent to the demand, thereby adding further woes to the already ailing sector. Going forward, we expect trade activities to be discreet till Trump tariffs are completely rolled out, as this will decide how the industry will navigate with the new tariff regime. Additionally, we will need to monitor the development regarding the India-US Bilateral Trade Talks closely as that would decide the further course of trade activities between both the countries.

With food inflation turning negative (-1.06%) due to broad-based deflation in key staples like vegetables, pulses, and cereals, consumer purchasing power may receive a short-term boost. This benign inflation print could give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) greater headroom to consider easing. However, with core inflation components such as health and education still elevated above 4%, any monetary accommodation must be carefully sequenced to avoid reigniting price pressures in non-food sectors. The RBI is unlikely to act on the basis of a single data point. But if headline inflation remains below 4%, soft private consumption persists, and there is greater clarity on global developments, a rate cut cannot be ruled out. The tone of upcoming monetary policy statements will be critical to watch.

View from Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. Renewed tariff threats from Donald Trump caused Asia-Pacific markets to open the week on shaky ground. Exporters and supply-chain sensitive sectors were particularly cautious, as equities across the region showed a mixed reaction. Chinese markets continue to balance the risk of renewed tariffs from the US with recent signs of optimism from their own economy after targeted stimulus had a positive impact. Japan held steady as yen weakness offset export headwinds. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar showed resilience, suggesting traders are not panicking yet, and hope that it is just more posturing from Donald Trump before scaling back again. Meanwhile, Bitcoin made new all-time highs, ignoring traditional risk sentiment. The move higher reflects both a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty and growing speculation around new ETF inflows and central bank pressures. Tariff headlines will continue to create short-term volatility in the markets, whilst Bitcoin’s surge may be reflecting broader anti-fiat sentiment, rather than risk-on appetite. We should watch how the markets react to any further developments, and whether they see it as a real threat to the global economy and a potential escalation, or more political posturing from Trump.

Larger-than-expected drop in inflation puts August rate cut back on the table The larger-than-expected fall in India’s consumer price inflation to 2.1% y/y in June raises the prospect of the RBI cutting interest rates further at its policy meeting next month. But given the RBI delivered a bumper 50bp rate cut last month and clearly signalled that its easing cycle was over, we suspect that the high bar for further easing has not been cleared. The headline rate eased from 2.8% y/y in May to 2.1% in June, its lowest rate since January 2019, which was a bigger drop than both we and the consensus had expected (CE forecast: 2.6%; LSEG consensus: 2.5%). We will get the full breakdown shortly, but our Food CPI nowcast suggests that food inflation continued to edge lower last month. We suspect inflation bottomed out in June, but it is likely to rise only gradually towards the RBI’s 4% target over the rest of the year. Underlying price pressures are likely to build further as the economy continues to grow at a robust pace, pushing up core inflation. But, while food prices can be extremely volatile in India, supportive weather conditions should keep them in check over the coming months. In terms of the policy implications, June’s softer-than-expected inflation data – the last set of inflation numbers before the RBI’s next policy announcement on 6th August – certainly increases the prospects of another interest rate cut. That said, the fact that the RBI delivered a sizeable 50bp cut in June and in its communications hinted that the easing cycle was now over by shifting its policy stance from “accommodative” to “neutral” suggests to us that the bar to a resumption in the easing cycle is high. As a result, we are sticking to our view that policy settings will be left on hold in August. And a gradual pick-up in inflation over the coming year suggests that the RBI can leave the repo rate at 5.50% well into 2026. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Recent Interview...

Title: Ethereum ETFs surpass $5 billion in net flows, BlackRock’s ETHA record 6th highest inflow week

Ethereum ETFs took 12 trading days to capture over $1 billion in inflows, beating the previous billion mark by three trading sessions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surpassed $5 billion in net inflows on July 11, just 12 trading days after crossing the $4 billion mark, according to Farside Investors data. The milestone reflects a faster pace than the previous interval, when the products required 15 trading sessions to add the prior $1 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) contributed a large portion of the most recent inflows. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that ETHA recorded $675 million in weekly net subscriptions, placing it sixth across all US ETFs for the period ending July 11. He framed ETHA’s weekly haul as a significant moment, noting on July 12 that the vehicle is “hanging with the big dogs for the first time.” The fund closed the week ahead of traditional equity and bond vehicles despite operating in the shadow of larger Bitcoin products. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, absorbed $1.7 billion over the same span. Ethereum ETFs launched on July 23, 2024, and crossed $4 billion in cumulative flows on June 23, achieving this milestone in 231 trading days. The first $3 billion required 216 sessions. By contrast, the jump from $4 billion to $5 billion occurred in just over two weeks of trading, including five consecutive days with total inflows exceeding $200 million. Aggregate daily data from July show that ETHA alone drew $300.9 million on July 10, followed by $158.6 million on July 9 and $137.1 million on July 11. Other issuers such as Fidelity (FETH) and Bitwise (ETHW) posted consistent additions, while Grayscale’s legacy ETHE product saw redemptions. Due to the recent additions, spot Ethereum ETFs now represent over 10% of the total inflows of Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US.

Title: Bitcoin sceptic Vanguard becomes largest shareholder in Michael Saylor's Strategy: Bloomberg

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/14/2025 12:52:53 PM PDT by NoLibZone Despite having called Bitcoin BTC +0.59% an "immature asset class" that is inappropriate for long-term investors, Vanguard Group has become the largest shareholder in Strategy, according to a report from Bloomberg. Through its funds, the $10-trillion money manager owns 20 million Strategy shares or 8% of the outstanding common stock, according to a Bloomberg chart. Vanguard most likely passed Capital Group Cos. to become the top shareholder of Strategy shares during the fourth quarter, the report said. Strategy (ticker MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become a proxy bet for Bitcoin as the company's chief business proposition has been acquiring BTC. Consequently, Strategy's share price has risen in unison with the price of Bitcoin, driving other companies to pursue crypto treasury strategies. With multi-billion-dollar spot Bitcoin ETFs issued by Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, and nations all around the world adopting or embracing not only BTC but digital assets in general, demand has never been greater. Bitcoin earlier today hit an all-time high and surpassed the $120,000 level. Also on Monday, Strategy, which is co-founded by executive chairman Michael Saylor, purchased another 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 601,550 BTC.

In the past, I bought a bitcoin at $350, used a little over half and then let it sit. A couple years later, it was over $25,000 and I took my family to Disney World on it. I am way ahead. I have bought more and sold on various exchanges over the years, including stock based on it. In answer to your final question, that is why I have my money spread over many areas. I have stocks I have bitcoin and other alt coins I have physical silver and a little gold I have other collectibles that have value. I keep some cash at home I do as much as possible to spread my assets around. My house is paid off My cars are paid off There are a group of people who come on to every Bitcoin thread and post the same crap from 2010. How many posts do we have to get to heard about the EMP concern. LOL? It’s best to ignore them. They are either intentionally obtuse or just contrary. You have your own private key to your Bitcoin assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Best practice is to back up your “key” in several places like an S.D. box at the bank, etc.. Do not give your private keys to “...some teenager in Mama’s basement...” 😉 The Bitcoin blockchain is maintained/”mined” worldwide by thousands of nodes (including one at my home) and at large financial institutions. Any one node can restore/recall all the Bitcoin transactions made all the way back to 2009. Some safer (safer than exchanges like Coinbase) private key storage options: https://cryptosteel.com https://coldcard.com https://www.ledger.com https://trezor.io The “Free People’s Currency” (original Bitcoin Whitepaper from Satoshi N. after the 2008 “GFC”): https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/whitepaper/ Bitcoin Course: https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=30687 interesting that they don’t agree with it anymore tulips! Today you could by 200,030 nice fat tulips for one bitcoin. That’s up about 20% for the year. EMP is sooooooo last month! It’s quantum computing now, dontcha know? Next month it’ll be AI, the month after it’ll be Captain Crunch whistles, the next month... lol So my vote’s for “just contrary”. If we’re all such idiots, I don’t get why they bother trying to “educate” us, arguing with a pig and the like. trust is a big word such well-known companies don’t steal from their customers so far as I’ve heard or did you mean, trust any advice they may give? (I’d say, listen...and verify...don’t just follow every recommendation they give out...) congrats! wounderful! (I’d be diversifying out to other types of assets and not always doubling down on the same thing, but then I am either prudent, cautious, wise, or chicken... your choice) smiles thank you. i need to learn more and will look at what you’ve so kindly provided cheer, fhc sounds GREAT! that’s sorta what I was suggesting people do, diversify prudently and not put 100 percent into just one thing thanks great! and I haven’t been to Disneyworld so maybe my investing system needs a bit more pizazz thanks Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: Vanguard Becomes the Accidental Strategy Whale
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/14/vanguard-accidentally-becomes-largest-holder-of-strategy-stock-despite-anti-bitcoin-stance
Time Published: 2025-07-14T19:47:01Z
Full Content:
Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to bitcoin ETFs, has emerged as the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), a company whose business model is built around buying and holding bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, Vanguard now owns more than 20 million shares of MSTR — over 8% of the company — surpassing Capital Group as the top institutional holder. The stake is worth about $9.26 billion. "God has a sense of humor," said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. "Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally." "Institutional dementia," said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. “Indexing into $9 billion of what you openly mock isn't strategy,” he wrote in a post on X. Vanguard's exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategy’s strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguard’s funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria. Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about $72 billion since 2020. The company’s shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over $80 billion in assets. Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasn't shifted the firm’s position. “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji said after his appointment.

Title: Bitcoin Price Hits $123K All-Time High Before ‘Crypto Week’ In D.C.

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. The US Capitol as Washington hosts 'Crypto Week' (Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL ... More NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Bitcoin’s price reached a historic high early Monday morning, July 14, capping off a weekend rally fueled by record ETF inflows, investor optimism, and growing institutional interest. The milestone coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are split between advancing pro-crypto legislation and spotlighting “blatant corruption,” as Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters put it, tied to the Trump administration’s digital asset involvement. The data aggregation site CoinMarketCap indicated that bitcoin’s price rally peaked at $123,091.61 early morning on July 14, 2025, setting a new all-time high. Bitcoin’s price has now gained more than 30% since January, rebounding from an April low of just above $75,000. Institutional inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds have bolstered the surge and the anticipation of pro-crypto legislation in Congress. ETH, Sol, XRP, among other top cryptocurrencies, also posted gains so far this year. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at approximately $3.8 trillion. On Thursday alone, bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18 billion in net inflows — the largest single-day total of 2025. Funds such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have played a key role in driving mainstream access to the asset. In a post on X, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that because of “recent flows and the overnight rally, [the fund] Bitcoin policy momentum includes the Generational Economic National Innovation for U.S. Strategy, known as the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that introduces the first federal framework for regulating stablecoins. The GENIUS Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee last month and is expected to continue making progress this week in the House of Representatives. The GENIUS Act defines payment stablecoins as digital assets that must be redeemable at a fixed value, like one U.S. dollar. Issuers are required to back each stablecoin with an equal amount of approved reserve assets, such as Treasury bills, insured bank deposits, or central bank reserves. These reserves can only be used for redemptions or specific collateralized transactions. Issuers must follow rules on capital, liquidity, and risk management but are exempt from traditional bank capital requirements. They must also provide clear redemption policies, disclose reserve holdings, and undergo third-party audits. Those with over $50 billion in circulation must submit annual audited financial statements. The bill also bans interest payments on stablecoins and imposes strict anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance, with restrictions on executives with financial crime convictions. Banks, credit unions, or qualified nonbanks can issue stablecoins. Issuers with over $10 billion must operate under federal oversight, while smaller nonbanks may opt for a state-based regime if it aligns with federal standards. The bill outlines rules for foreign stablecoins and allows their use if regulatory standards are met. Custodians must keep customer funds separate from their own, and banks can use blockchain to manage stablecoin services. In the event of bankruptcy, stablecoin holders are prioritized for repayment. The bill clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities or commodities and prohibits misleading marketing or bundling. Senior federal officials must disclose stablecoin holdings above $5,000. Bitcoin’s rally arrives during what has been dubbed “Crypto Week” in Washington, a series of policy hearings, roundtables, and advocacy events across Capitol Hill focused on the digital asset economy. “We are taking historic steps to ensure the United States remains the world’s leader in innovation, and I look forward to ‘Crypto Week’ in the House,” said Rep. French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in a public statement. Among the events scheduled are a House Ways and Means hearing on crypto tax policy, a Dodd-Frank retrospective touching on decentralized finance, and ongoing closed-door meetings between Senate staff and industry stakeholders. At the same time, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee have launched a coordinated effort labeled “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” aimed at countering what they describe as “regulatory capture” by the Trump administration and ethical lapses related to digital assets. Waters is leading the Democratic campaign, which includes public statements, investigative memos and proposed legislation. President Donald Trump’s memecoin initiatives are a main focus of these criticisms from Democrats. The collectible $TRUMP coin, launched in early 2025, has been promoted by individuals associated with the Trump campaign and has drawn scrutiny over its financial and political implications. Trump has aggressively embraced bitcoin and other digital assets during his second term. In March, he issued an executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” also stating that he is “very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field.” The Trump administration’s recent actions, including the removal of key Securities and Exchange Commission staff focused on digital asset enforcement, have raised questions about whether regulatory safeguards are being scaled back. At the same time, the administration’s pro-crypto stance has been viewed by some in the industry as a potential catalyst for U.S. leadership in digital innovation. Still, the alignment presents a cultural tension. While the Bitcoin ecosystem promotes decentralization and resistance to centralized control, the political branding surrounding Trump often emphasizes hierarchy, loyalty, and singular leadership. Despite growing controversy, bitcoin’s climb to $123,000 marks one of the fastest in its 16-year history. After reaching $100,000 in December and $110,000 by late May, the price of bitcoin grew another $13,000 in just 53 days. The rally follows a volatile first half of 2025, including a sharp April dip driven by regulatory uncertainty and rising Treasury yields. Renewed ETF inflows and clearer policy signals have since reignited momentum. This new high is more than a market milestone. It highlights the expanding role that bitcoin plays in the financial system, even with the intensified debates over how digital assets should be regulated. The rally has reinforced the view that bitcoin is moving closer to mainstream financial use cases. Whether the GENIUS Act can provide lasting structure, or whether political infighting and memecoin speculation undercut trust, may become clearer in the weeks ahead. Bitcoin’s record-setting price arrives at a pivotal moment for United States crypto policy. As lawmakers debate comprehensive regulation and examine political connections to the industry, the market appears to be pricing in long-term legitimacy. What happens next in Washington could shape the future of bitcoin and the broader digital asset economy.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT becomes top 20 ETF in US, poised to exceed $100 billion in assets this month

Market analysts noted that BTC rally is pushing the BlackRock's ETF towards unprecedented $100 billion asset mark. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on track to surpass $100 billion in assets this month, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In a June 14 post on X, Balchunas noted that while he previously projected the fund, IBIT, could hit the $100 billion mark this summer, it could happen even sooner. He highlighted that the ETF has already reached $88 billion in assets thanks to recent inflows and BTC’s overnight rally above $120,000. He pointed out that the current AuM places the fund as the 20th largest ETF in the US and the 7th largest for BlackRock. Remarkably, it is also the asset manager’s most profitable ETF, even though it is just 1.5 years old. Observers pointed out that the recent price surge in Bitcoin would further spark renewed momentum and drive institutional capital into the fund. Bitcoin analyst Kiwi said: “This week could mark a massive shift in allocation to BTC/IBIT should this pump continue – the money on the sidelines isn’t retail – it’s smart money. Hw long can they sit by and watch this train roll past without action? The career risk to not owning a substantial amount of Bitcoin is getting larger by the hour.” Data from SoSo Value shows $IBIT’s cumulative net inflows reached $54.40 billion as of July 11. The ETF now holds more than 705,000 BTC, which is roughly 3.6% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Hyperbitcoinization looms as Bitcoin climbs financial ranks with sovereign and corporate backing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin has outpaced traditional benchmarks since 2020, registering gains exceeding 1,500%, while gold advanced roughly 115% and the U.S. Dollar Index remained nearly flat. The divergence in asset performance reflects a period of monetary expansion, persistent inflation concerns, and evolving perceptions of scarce, non-sovereign assets as institutional investors and sovereign entities re-evaluate reserves and portfolio allocations. Bitcoin climbed from price levels near $7,700 in early 2020 to intraday highs around $123,164 today, driven partly by a weak dollar and spot exchange-traded funds in the United States that removed barriers to institutional participation. As BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exceeded 700,000 BTC in holdings and surpassed $88 billion in assets under management, the asset class has been increasingly woven into regulated investment products. Institutional access is regarded as creating a price floor while mitigating the volatility traditionally associated with digital assets. Gold’s upward trajectory continued through the same period, rising from around $1,550 per ounce to over $3,300, as geopolitical tensions and inflation protection strategies preserved demand for physical assets. Meanwhile, the dollar’s relative value against other currencies remains flat after substantial volatility, and its purchasing power has eroded by an estimated 20% cumulatively from 2020 to 2025 due to inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic policy responses in 2020 fueled an expansion of monetary supply and fiscal interventions unprecedented in modern history, prompting market participants to seek stores of value beyond fiat. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature positioned it as both a speculative vehicle and a potential hedge, capturing capital from investors diversifying away from sovereign currency exposure. Bitcoin’s acceleration has led many to explore the thesis of Hyperbitcoinization, where it might replace fiat currencies as a primary medium of exchange and store of value. While the prevailing analyses maintain this scenario remains improbable in the near term, today’s environment mirrors how fiat currencies’ fall would start. Bitcoin has become a macro asset comparable to gold rather than an imminent replacement for the dollar. Regulatory frameworks, taxation requirements mandating fiat settlement, and the economic risk of deflation inherent in fixed-supply monetary systems remain substantial hurdles to Bitcoin fully supplanting traditional currencies. Institutions and governments have nonetheless integrated Bitcoin into treasury strategies. As CryptoSlate has reported, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi disclosed a $439 million position in Bitcoin ETFs. In the United States, President Trump signed an executive order initiating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling official sector interest in holding Bitcoin alongside traditional reserves. Further complicating the outlook, U.S. trade policy in 2025 has introduced tariffs on major trading partners, contributing to inflationary pressures and leading to a decline of around 10% in the dollar index year-to-date. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink cautioned in public statements that persistent fiscal deficits and the risk of dollar debasement could elevate digital assets like Bitcoin as alternatives, reflecting sentiment from parts of the financial establishment that Bitcoin’s role is shifting from speculative asset to strategic reserve. Currently, the total US debt stands at $37 trillion and rising, while the dollar is in a precarious position. However, surging institutional adoption has coincided with declining evidence of grassroots activity. While on-chain throughput broke above 500,000 transfers a day several times in 2025, Lightning Network capacity has remained relatively flat around 5,000 BTC since mid-2022. Further, the past few months have seen a slight drop in capacity to around 4,300 BTC, according to mempool.space. Though the Lightning Network is not the only way to move Bitcoin on-chain cheaply, numerous layer-1s host forms of wrapped Bitcoin, which are used regularly across multiple chains. Transfers below $1,000 do make up more than half of the total on-chain Bitcoin volume, pointing to peer-to-peer settlement rather than exchange consolidation. Those metrics, paired with ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, Abu Dhabi’s allocation, and the U.S. strategic reserve order, create a picture that matches the early stage of Hyperbitcoinization: fiat dilution, a stronger Bitcoin price, and the first migration of day-to-day transactions onto a rival monetary rail. If throughput on Lightning and other layers widens further, the framework for mass transactional adoption will be in place, and Bitcoin’s role will move from balance-sheet hedge to usable money. That transition is underway, but the focus remains on acquiring Bitcoin rather than integrating Bitcoin as a technological tool to revolutionize TradFi. Still, maybe that’s not what we need right now. If the corporate world relies on Bitcoin for its store of value, placing that value in Lightning Channels to earn yield or staking it to secure other blockchains becomes an enticing offer. From there, using Bitcoin to secure critical infrastructure and building tech stacks around Bitcoin’s immutable global timestamping service is a logical next step. At that point, Bitcoin becomes not only the best store of value but the catalyst to secure and integrate that value into the entire digital world.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is on a tear. Bitcoin rocketed past $120,000 for the first time in history to notch a new all-time high of nearly $123,000 early Monday morning, according to data from Binance. The cryptocurrency posted a daily jump of about 3% and a weekly gain of more than 12%. Bitcoin’s Monday surge follows a string of recent highs. After hovering under $110,000 for more than a month, it notched new records on Thursday and through the weekend amid a corresponding rally in the stock market. Bitcoin’s jump in price also comes amid a glut of demand from institutional investors, who are more likely to invest in crypto through digital asset products offered by established Wall Street firms. Crypto ETFs from the asset management giant BlackRock saw an influx of more than $2.4 billion over the past week, according to data from the crypto investment firm CoinShares. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose nearly 3% over the past day to shoot past $3,000. It’s up 20% in the past week. Despite the gains from the two largest cryptocurrencies, the total market capitalization of all digital assets was down 0.5% day-over-day to about $3.87 trillion. In total, crypto ETFs recorded an inflow of $3.7 billion last week, the second-largest week on record, according to CoinShares. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, attributed the booming demand for Bitcoin to “political developments and signals from the Federal Reserve.” On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released minutes for its June meeting. Officials largely agreed that there would be cuts in interest rates sometime this year. “Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate,” read the summary of the meeting. Meanwhile, positive political developments for crypto in Congress buoyed investor enthusiasm, said Butterfill. The House is set to vote this week on the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate stablecoins, which the Senate passed in June. It is also set to vote on the CLARITY Act, legislation that would specify how U.S. financial agencies should regulate digital assets writ large. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Ethereum price prediction is making headlines after EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson forecasted that ETH could reach $1.5 million per token over time. With Ethereum staking ETF approval likely before October, Jackson believes the real price rally hasn't even started. He points to Ethereum's growing use by major companies like Coinbase and Shopify, deflationary token supply, and increasing demand from traditional finance. Jackson says this shift could make Ethereum a “100-bagger” asset. With ETH currently trading around $3,040, his base case targets $10K by 2026. If adoption and staking take off, ETH’s long-term value could surprise everyone.

Title: BSGM Engages CXG to Acquire FINRA/SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer to Expand Publicly Traded RWA Tokenization Operations

Time Published: 2025-07-14T12:35:44Z
Full Content:
July 14, 2025 – Los Angeles, United States BioSig Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: BSGM) (‘BioSig’), which recently merged with Streamex Exchange Corporation (‘Streamex’) (together, ‘BSGM’ or the ‘Company’), is excited to announce a critical step toward becoming one of the first fully regulated RWA tokenization companies trading on a major US exchange. Streamex has engaged Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. Management notes that the near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for US institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. Near term, the acquisition positions Streamex to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. Investors can buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and US regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and co-founder of Streamex, said, “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig. “Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the US. “Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” Morgan Lekstrom, executive chairman of the Company, added, “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.” The FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the US, will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. Compliance Exchange Group (CXG), a leader in broker-dealer compliance, will oversee the acquisition to ensure seamless integration and adherence to regulations. This acquisition is a critical step toward scaling Streamex’s RWA tokenization platform nationwide. Streamex is a gold treasury and infrastructure company building the foundation for on-chain commodity markets. With a focus on RWA tokenization, Streamex is developing a vertically integrated platform that combines token issuance, trading infrastructure and physical gold holdings, positioning the Company to become one of Nasdaq’s largest public holders of gold bullion. This strategic approach aligns with Streamex’s mission to reshape global finance by bringing the approximately $142 trillion global commodities market on chain. By merging the security and trust of physical gold with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain, Streamex is creating scalable financial infrastructure for a new era of digital commodities. The Company plans to hold significant quantities of physical gold, securely vaulted through a top-tier bullion bank. Streamex will denominate the majority of its balance sheet in vaulted gold rather than fiat currency, supporting a long-term, value-based financial model. Combined with Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain infrastructure, this strategy enables a recurring revenue model that supports the issuance of gold-backed digital assets. Streamex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSig Technologies, Inc. CXG specializes in building, managing and supporting broker-dealer infrastructure, offering full-service compliance, registration, principal outsourcing and advisory services. BioSig Technologies, Inc. is a medical device technology company with an advanced digital signal processing technology platform, the PURE EP Platform, that delivers insights to electrophysiologists for ablation treatments of cardiovascular arrhythmias. The PURE EP Platform enables electrophysiologists to acquire raw signal data in real-time – absent unnecessary noise or interference – to maximize procedural success and minimize unnecessary inefficiencies.

Title: Crypto Market Outlook: How Crypto Will Come of Age in 2025

2024 was a significant year for cryptocurrency markets, both in terms of growth, user adoption, investment, and technological progress. However, progress made in 2024 could seem minor compared to the possible changes ahead in 2025. Recent political changes in the United States point to the start of regulatory clarity. 2025 could be the year the crypto space, active since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch, finally comes into its own. This “clarity” could be a key step to completing crypto’s move from the financial fringes to the mainstream. From there, expect institutional adoption, already surging, to further accelerate. While nothing is certain, all of these factors point to another promising outcome for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a possible move higher, as this asset class comes of age, bringing stronger market support. Over the past few years, the US cryptocurrency space has been operating with a high level of regulatory uncertainty. Crypto companies operating within the US contended with not just a lack of a regulatory framework, but aggressive enforcement actions from US securities regulators as well. Fortunately, this major headwind is soon coming to an end. On Jan. 20, the new Trump administration took office, promising major changes to US cryptocurrency policy. Based on statements made by the President, there is a strong likelihood that, perhaps within the first 100 days of his administration, the US federal government will commence implementing policy changes that promote the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Binance CEO Richard Teng shares what he expects in the crypto industry in 2025: “Crypto regulation developments are expected from the new US government in 2025, which will encourage more crypto participation across the market, especially from US-based TradFi, and will help inform crypto legislation for other countries across the world.” Teng continued his comments, “There is also the potential of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US, which could be a significant development and lead to many other countries doing the same. In this scenario, Bitcoin could one day grow to new heights in terms of adoption.” Included in these policy changes will likely be the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This will bring forth an era of regulatory clarity for US cryptocurrency companies. As this takes shape at the same time other major justifications establish regulatory frameworks of their own, expect this to be a game changer. Mostly, because this regulatory clarity stands to cement crypto’s status as a major asset class. In turn, count on this having a tremendous impact on the allocation of institutional capital into Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, as well as into cryptocurrency investment products. Over the past year, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) has resulted in massive inflows of institutional and retail investor capital into this space, to the tune of $44.2 billion. However, once comprehensive regulations are implemented, and US regulators go from an aggressive, sceptical stance to one supportive of industry growth, last year’s inflows could prove to be a drop in the bucket compared to future inflows of capital, especially from institutional investors. With major firms like Blackrock now recommending portfolio allocations of up to 2% into Bitcoin, in 2025 and beyond, it’s possible that institutional investors, ranging from state pension funds to sovereign wealth funds and university endowments, begin committing far greater amounts of capital, both directly into cryptocurrencies, as well as into ETPs like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Alongside investment into crypto itself, this asset class’ “coming of age” could also lead to increased venture capital investment into blockchain-based startups. According to recent data from the DeFi Report, blockchain-based startups obtained $13.6 billion in venture capital funding last year, a figure that this year could rise to as much as $18 billion. Considering the supportive conditions expected for crypto investment and adoption, it’s clear that there has been justification for the ramp-up in bullishness for Bitcoin and other cryptos over the past few months. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, recently announced Federal Reserve policy changes have negatively impacted the short-term performance of most heavyweight cryptocurrencies. Further adjustments to Fed policy may have a similar impact. Still, given the potential for regulatory changes and other factors to finally trigger a “coming of age” moment for cryptocurrencies, this milestone may be significant enough to counter other concerns, resulting in further price appreciation for Bitcoin, major altcoins, and even help sustain recent high enthusiasm for speculative cryptos such as Meme coins.

Industrial supplier Fastenal (FAST) posted a solid earnings report early Monday, opening a busy week of earnings set to be dominated by big banks and tech giants like Netflix (NFLX), Fastenal, maker of a variety of fasteners and tools, reported second-quarter revenue of $2.08 billion, along with earnings per share of $0.29, narrowly topping estimates of $2.07 billion and $0.28 per share respectively, per Visible Alpha. Sales and profits rose from the same time a year ago. Shares of Fastenal, which recently underwent a two-for-one stock split and set a record high last week, were up 4% in afternon trading. They entered the day up 20% since the start of this year.a Fastenal effectively kicks off the second-quarter earnings season with its report. Financial-services giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) are all set to report this week. Investors will also get insights into the markets for air travel, streaming, and the health of the American consumer with United Airlines (UAL), Netflix, and PepsiCo (PEP), respectively. Analysts are largely expecting a solid quarter from most of the S&P 500 with earnings expected to grow year-over-year. Others remain more cautious about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and expect executives to provide more clarity on the subject in earnings calls in the coming weeks. Fastenal credited its increasing sales to "improved customer contract signings over the last six quarters," as it added that "market conditions remained sluggish providing minimal contribution."

Title: From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5w2k5k5ylo
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:27:58Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate. Worry not. If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean. While many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the "crypto capital of the world" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a "scam". Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets. But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes. Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain. The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called "miners" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency. However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin "halving" (or "halvening") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers. A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees. A crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage. Ethereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy. ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies. A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, "on the spot", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Meme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time. They can also be susceptible to "rug pulls" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales. Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins. "Stable" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value. This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets. Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability. XRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain. This has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value.

Title: Vanguard Expands Fixed-Income Menu with 3 Treasury ETFs

The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Apparently, Vanguard is looking to spend some quality bonding time with clients. Last week, the world’s second-largest asset manager launched three government bond ETFs: the Vanguard Government Securities Active ETF (VGVT), the Vanguard Total Treasury ETF (VTG) and the Vanguard Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTP). That brings the total number of fixed-income ETFs it has launched this year to nine. Vanguard isn’t alone in its efforts. Across the industry, issuers are racing to launch fixed-income products as the market environment becomes more fertile for bonds and Treasurys. “Just about every asset manager is pushing into fixed-income,” said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst for Morningstar, adding that fixed-income is a massive trend but isn’t talked about as much as active or options-based income strategies. Fixed-income products have been a priority for the firm since Tim Buckley’s tenure as CEO, but up until recently, the opportunity just wasn’t there for those kinds of ETFs, Sotiroff told Advisor Upside. “It’s hard to sell a product when short-term yields are at near 0% like they were for much of the 2010s,” he said. Today, however, interest rates are hovering near the historical average and equity markets are volatile, creating “a period where fixed-income has reemerged as a valuable diversifier in a balanced portfolio,” according to Sam Martinez, senior fixed-income product manager at Vanguard. The firm’s latest fixed-income ETFs include one actively managed product and two index funds: “Client value is our motivation for building out our fixed-income lineup,” Martinez said, adding that nine funds Vanguard has launched this year have garnered more than $2 billion in assets. And They’re Off! Asset managers have launched nearly 80 fixed-income ETFs this year alone. While the list of issuers includes industry giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, it also features smaller names like Stone Ridge Asset Management, Bluemonte and Cohen & Steers. “Everybody’s been throwing their hat into the ring,” Sotiroff said. JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Numerous products have been awaiting approval by the SEC, and more, such as an index-based crypto ETF, are in development. Rich investors with large stock portfolios and capital gains get a tax bonus with 351 ETF exchanges. The fund enters into swap agreements with J.P. Morgan and tracks an index from MerQube. The buy now, pay later business has a stigma that could hold back a proposed ETF focused on the market, one observer noted. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Tariff Fallout Hasn’t Hit Markets Yet. Issuers Say That Could Change

Strategists from Allianz and Invesco are cautioning investors about market performance in the second half of the year. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com As if we needed more tariff turmoil. Strategists from some of the world’s top asset managers are now cautioning investors about a possible market slowdown in the second half of 2025 as the effects of President Trump’s tariff policy spread through the broader economy. Experts from Vanguard, BlackRock, Allianz and Invesco are keeping a close eye on growth as the added costs from levies on foreign goods drive up prices in the US. While timing the markets is anyone’s guess, the potential of higher inflation could push investors into derivative-based products, like buffered ETFs, to hedge against a market dip, according to Charlie Ripley, vice president of portfolio management at Allianz. “The impact from tariffs will be a meaningful pickup of inflation that has yet to show up in the hard data sets,” he said. “Our perspective on the direction of travel for equity markets, first and foremost, includes a wider range of outcomes.” Inflation is one thing, but it’s not the only issue keeping economists up at night. Trump’s recently passed tax and spending bill should have a marginally positive impact on the economy as Americans consume more over the next few years, Ripley said. “On the other hand, the increase in spending is going to have to be funded somehow and despite the run-up in rates we have already seen, the supply and demand picture for long-dated Treasurys could keep upward pressure on yields,” he told ETF Upside. If tariffs do drive up inflation, the Fed will have its hands tied on any further interest rate cuts. Finding a consensus among a divided Fed could also prove difficult as long as inflation is looming, Ripley added. The good news: “We recognize that things could change quickly with the current administration with global trade and geopolitics remaining as top risks,” Ripley said. Let’s All Play Nice. There are other key global trends that could loom large over the second half, too, including restrictive immigration policies here at home and investments moving into the defense sector in Europe, said Brian Levitt, a global market strategist at Invesco. “These dynamics suggest a more inflationary environment and moderated growth outlook for the US in 2025, relative to earlier expectations,” Levitt said in a recent outlook, adding that global markets may also wane. However, a “constructive resolution of trade tensions” could sustain markets through the end of the year. Here’s to hoping. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. Invesco recently added several active ETFs to its product lineup, and PGIM is among those prepping a few more. © 2025 The Daily Upside
