BlackRock’s IBIT suffered its largest single-day outflow in history on 18 November, as institutional clients exited Bitcoin positions. The redemptions forced BlackRock to sell the underlying BTC BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic $523 million outflow on 18 November 18. Institutional clients dumped Bitcoin exposure through IBIT as BTC failed to reclaim $100K, triggering the largest net negative flow in the fund’s history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just suffered its worst day ever. IBIT hemorrhaged $523 million on 18 November, shattering all previous outflow records as institutional investors abandoned Bitcoin positions below $90,000. Arkham Intelligence data reveals the magnitude of the exodus. BlackRock buys or sells Bitcoin to settle outstanding IBIT shares on a T+1 basis. This means today’s $523M BTC sale reflects actual client trading activity from yesterday. The outflow represents the largest net negative flow in IBIT’s entire existence. No other day comes close. IBIT’s selling pressure overwhelmed the broader spot Bitcoin ETF landscape, according to Soso Value data. Total market outflows hit -$372.77M on 18 November, with BlackRock’s fund accounting for 140% of total negative flows. Source: SoSoValue Other major ETFs showed minimal activity. Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, Ark’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL all recorded zero or near-zero flows. Only Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund posted meaningful inflows at $139.63M, but this couldn’t offset IBIT’s historic dump. The data showed that institutional money fled Bitcoin through the industry’s largest and most liquid ETF. Bitcoin crashed 3.15% to $89,989.82 as the institutional selling wave hit. The breakdown confirmed technical weakness that’s been building since BTC failed to hold $100K in mid-November. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator is currently at -3,755.91, indicating deeply bearish momentum. Bitcoin has shed nearly $10,000 from recent highs near $100K, erasing weeks of gains in a matter of days. IBIT still holds $72.76 billion in total net assets, representing 3.93% of Bitcoin’s market cap. The fund has maintained cumulative net inflows of $58.22 billion since its launch. However, yesterday’s record outflow signals a potential shift in institutional sentiment. The timing suggests institutional clients lost confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim six figures. After multiple rejections at $100K, large allocators pulled the trigger on redemptions. BlackRock must sell the underlying Bitcoin when clients redeem IBIT shares. The $523M figure represents actual BTC that hit the market, not just paper selling. This real supply pressure accelerated Bitcoin’s descent below key support levels. Is this a temporary pause in the institutional Bitcoin adoption story, or the start of a deeper correction?

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2025 8:04:54 AM PST by Red Badger The endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report. According to a new SEC filing, the Harvard University endowment’s largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report. At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoin’s price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Google’s parent company). Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowment’s holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters, the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowment’s holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, it’s definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments. According to Forbes, Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities. Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy A joint venture between Phelan Development and LaSalle Partners has secured $66.7 million to refinance Lathrop II, a two-building industrial warehouse development that spans 847,000 square feet in Lathrop, Calif., Commercial Observer can first report. Affinius Capital provided the loan, while Preferred Capital Advisors’ Craig Zarro arranged the financing. Eric Cohen, Affinius Capital’s managing director and co-head of debt origination, noted that Lanthrop II is a recently completed industrial property that enters a submarket with “strong fundamentals” and access to “key demand drivers,” being located in Northern California’s Central Valley. “That should position it well to capture growing tenant demand in the region,” he added Located at 17995 Murphy Parkway in Lathrop — a sister city of Stockton within Northern California’s San Joaquin Valley — Lathrop II features one industrial building spanning 457,000 square feet and another totaling 390,000 square feet.

Title: CMBS Expert Mike Strug Leaves BlackRock to Join Stephen Muller’s Vanadium Group
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/11/cmbs-expert-mike-strug-join-vanadium-group/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:56:06Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy One of the great connectors in commercial real estate has jumped from BlackRock to a lesser-known advisory shop that specializes in equity deals and major mixed-use projects. Mike Strug, founder of the Young Real Estate Professionals of New York (YREPNY), an informal networking group that has connected thousands of industry players since 2001, has left BlackRock after 14 years as a vice president of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) analytics to join Vanadium Group. Vanadium Group is a six-person advisory firm founded in 2019 by Stephen Muller, formerly chief investment officer at Arris Properties Group and managing director at Greenwich Group International. The firm specializes primarily in equity — and some debt — brokerage, where it connects middle-market capital markets owner-operators and developers to the debt and equity needed to finish CRE projects or finance new ones. Strug, who began his 28-year CRE career in lending, told CO that as much as he loved working at BlackRock’s analytics arm, he wanted to get back into the nitty-gritty of deal flow. “I wanted to get back on the deal side,” he said. “We’re nimble, there’s only six of us here, I’ve known Steve Muller for 23 years … so it was the perfect fit for me to come over.” Before joining BlackRock, Strug spent several years as a loan officer at IDB Bank, as an investment officer at Assurant, and as a senior originations associate at TIAA-CREF. Strug also said that the move over the Vanadium aids the position he holds as founder of YREPNY, which has met once a month in New York City for the past 24 years. That volunteer job has turned Strug into an in-demand guest speaker at colleges and “a pseudo-mentor for thousands of young professionals,” as he humbly describes himself. “It’s helped me expand my network over the years and give back,” he said. “And here, now, I’m able to leverage my network and help drive business for Vanadium Group.” Muller began his career 25 years ago underwriting deals at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and has directed and overseen real estate investments worth exceeding $20 billion across different asset classes in multiple C-suite capacities. He told CO he was thrilled to find someone like Strug who can aid Vanadium’s underwriting through his decades of private equity CMBS analysis and his deep list of contacts forged from his monthly mentorship meetings. “We do a huge amount of the work, and to be able to find someone who has the kind of network like Mike’s, but who also has the intellectual horsepower, is not easy at all,” said Muller. “What I said to Mike was, ‘It’s not just your Rolodex that I view as an opportunity, but you were doing CMBS surveillance and writing private equity quality research materials.’ That’s not teachable.” Muller is the first to admit that many in the industry might not have heard of Vanadium, which specializes in making markets for preferred equity pieces of limited partner equity, as well as advising large-scale mixed-use projects. Muller listed The Wharf is Washington, D.C. and Miami Worldcenter as among the biggest mixed-use projects he’s advised and underwritten. But it’s the equity space, rather than the burgeoning world of private credit, that Muller and Strug believe offers them the greatest opportunity to bring investors together, either directly or through syndication. “Probably 80 percent of our business is equity, as opposed to debt, and that in and of itself is very unique — most of the advisory firms are the other way around,” explained Muller. “There are very few true equity shops left in the industry.” Moreover, Muller emphasized that Strug will help his firm build and grow its relationships with institutional equity groups like small to medium-size life insurance companies, pension funds and endowments, which often don’t have the ability to either syndicate equity originations in-house or create liquidity for their existing investments through the secondary market. “There are very few people like Mike who can truly speak the institutional language, have an incredible institutional Rolodex, but can also bring the entrepreneurial spirit that he brings,” said Muller. “He’s a natural-born entrepreneur and networker.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: $372M outflows hit Bitcoin ETFs – What’s driving the panic?

Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:00:17Z

What’s driving this unexpected reshuffling across crypto funds? Bitcoin ETFs saw $372.8 million in net outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT with $523.2 million in withdrawals. No, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton recorded inflows, while others remained flat. Global crypto investment products are facing a sharp pullback as rising macroeconomic uncertainty shakes investor confidence. Exchange-traded products saw a massive wave of outflows, with withdrawals crossing $2 billion worldwide. According to data from Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have been hit the hardest, recording continuous outflows since the 12th of November, signaling a shift in market sentiment just as volatility begins to climb. On the 18th of November, Bitcoin ETFs extended their losing streak, posting $372.8 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT led the downturn with $523.2 million in withdrawals, making it the only product with negative flows on that day. In contrast, other major issuers recorded modest inflows. Grayscale’s BTC added $139.6 million, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw $10.8 million. The remaining issuers recorded flat, zero flows, according to Farside Investors. These market moves came as Bitcoin slipped below the $90,000 mark, reflecting broader risk aversion. However, the asset showed early signs of recovery at press time, trading at $91,796.18, up 0.82% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. Yet, despite the slight bounce, sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin’s RSI stayed below the neutral line and continued trending downward, suggesting bearish momentum. Meanwhile, price volatility spiked, signaling unstable price action and highlighting that bulls may struggle to regain control in the short term. Source: Santiment A recent report by 21Shares noted that Bitcoin’s drop below $100K, now 27% off its peak, signals a short-term correction rather than a full-blown bear market. The decline has been driven by several factors: institutional unwinding of basis trades, falling yields, long-term holders offloading around 42,000 BTC, and continued ETF outflows. Broader macroeconomic pressures, including delayed interest rate cuts and weakness in tech markets, have added to the strain. Despite this pullback, the report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Selling pressure is easing, liquidity is improving post-shutdown, and long-term demand is growing, fueled by institutional interest and anticipated regulatory clarity. Key technical levels to watch are resistance at $98K–$100K and support at $85K. If Bitcoin can hold the $85K–$90K range and reclaim $98K–$102K, a move toward $110K+ is likely. However, a break below $85K could lead to extended consolidation in the $75K–$80K zone. Overall, the current move appears to be a healthy reset, not a trend reversal. If looked carefully, the largest chunk of ETF outflows, particularly from BlackRock, appears to be tied to institutional trading strategies rather than retail panic selling. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes noted that hedge funds, including firms like Goldman Sachs, were driving the withdrawals. These funds previously used Bitcoin ETFs to execute basis trades, a strategy where traders buy spot ETF positions while shorting Bitcoin Futures on CME to profit from the spread. When yields were high, the trade was lucrative, offering returns of around 14% in October. As spreads narrowed to below 5%, the trade lost its appeal, leading hedge funds to unwind their positions. According to Hayes, this wave of liquidations sparked institutional outflows, which in turn unsettled retail investors, intensifying the overall wave of withdrawals. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt of the recent market pullback, the trend wasn’t uniform across all assets. At press time, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs saw outflows of $74.2 million, reflecting broader caution toward major crypto assets. Investor sentiment toward alternative assets remained more positive, with Spot Solana [SOL] ETFs drawing $26.2 million in inflows during the same period. These mixed flows indicate that investors aren’t exiting digital assets altogether; they’re reallocating capital, reassessing risk, and exploring opportunities beyond dominant market leaders amid rising volatility.

Title: Property prices surge by 7.6%, but Taoiseach says government is 'making progress' in housing

THE GOVERNMENT’S NEW housing plan was today defended by the Taoiseach who claimed that the government is making progress on housing. Micheál Martin said the cost and affordability “continues to be an issue with a growing population”. His comments come after the release of the latest report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) finds that house prices jumped by 7.6% in the year to September. This is up from the 7.5% rise recorded in the year to August. Dublin saw prices rise by 5.3%, but they were up by 9.4% outside the capital in the year to September. The highest median price for a dwelling in the 12 months to September 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Donegal. Advertisement The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to September 2025 was Blackrock in Dublin, with a median price of €808,000, while Castlerea, Roscommon had the least expensive price of €148,000. Speaking during Leaders’ Questions, Labour leader Ivana Bacik described the new housing plan as “old milk in new bottles”. “Nothing new on affordable home ownership, no clarity on what new powers the Land Development Agency will have, and no ambition on social housing,” she added. She accused the government of abandoning annual targets for new home building. Martin hit back saying Bacik “told an untruth” when she said “the government had no social housing targets”. The government plans to deliver 12,000 new social homes “every year over the lifetime of the plan”, he said. Martin said needs the government needs to deliver upward of 50,000 houses a year, stating that €20 billion needs to be spent every year. “The state will not be able to do €20 billion every year. The private sector has to be involved,” he said, accusing Labour of consistently being hostile to any private sector dimension to housing. Related Reads Why Ireland's most toothless housing crisis measure is finally getting an overhaul Gaeltacht agency welcomes housing plan - but uncertainty remains over planning guidelines Here's what experts think of the government's housing plan Bacik also criticised a plan to reduce minimum apartment standards, which she said the government: “backed down in the courts on Monday”. In the High Court this week, the government’s legal representation said it would now carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to see whether the reduced apartment sizes are in line with existing regulations. They maintain the standard designs launched during the summer will not be modified. The Taoiseach responded, saying the new design standards had been put forward because the government wanted to “narrow the viability gap when it came to building apartments”. The Social Democrats Holly Cairns asked the Taoiseach why annual house building targets were not included in the government’s plans and why the overall target “goes beyond the lifetime of this government”. Martin claimed that under the previous plan, Housing for All, the Government “exceeded” its targets, describing it as an “inconvenient truth for the opposition”.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited 6,735 Bitcoin worth around $616 million and 64,706 Ethereum worth approximately $200 million into Coinbase today. The transfers were made to Coinbase Prime, which provides custody and trading services for institutional clients. The deposits continue a pattern of institutional transfers BlackRock has conducted in recent weeks as part of routine custodial adjustments tied to its crypto ETF operations. BlackRock operates spot ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, facilitating institutional investment in digital assets. Such large crypto movements by BlackRock often spark market discussions about potential selling pressure amid ETF outflows, though the transfers align with standard liquidity management practices for asset managers handling crypto ETF operations.

While the proposal for a dual listing bridge is subject to the completion of relevant regulatory processes, MAS will work with SGX to consult on the regulatory framework for a set of prospectus disclosure requirements comparable to that in the US, it said. This means companies that are interested in an initial public offering (IPO) can use a single set of offering documents to list on both exchanges concurrently, cutting down on regulatory friction and cost, MAS said. The cross-border listing framework will allow companies with a market capitalisation of S$2 billion (US$1.5 billion) and above to access global capital, investors and liquidity, said SGX and Nasdaq in a joint press release on Wednesday. With the bridge in place, companies will be able to simultaneously list on SGX and the US exchange, and dual-listed shares registered in the US can be settled on SGX and vice versa. This is one of the measures announced by the Equities Market Review Group, which was set up to give recommendations on how to strengthen the development of Singapore's stock market. MAS set up the review group in 2024 after SGX had its worst year for listings in 2023. The review group is led by Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat, who was Second Minister for Finance at the time. He is also the deputy chairman of MAS. At a press conference on Wednesday concluding the review, Mr Chee said: "We are still very keen to attract companies to list on the SGX mainboard, just as Nasdaq will still be very keen to attract companies to list on Nasdaq. "But we both see this as an additional option that some companies could find attractive, could find useful, and so this will help us to be able to enlarge the pie for both Nasdaq and SGX." For example, a company may be considered large by Singapore or Asian standards, but may end up "becoming smaller fish in a much bigger pond" if they were to list on Nasdaq on its own, he added. With the draw of both US and Singapore liquidity pools, the new board will support efforts to attract more Asian issuers into the Singapore ecosystem, said Mr Chee. The new board is envisaged to go live around mid-2026, he added. The announcements come amid growing interest in new SGX listings from corporates while MAS rolled out the review group's previous recommendations. The third quarter of 2025 saw more IPOs than in the whole of 2024. The Straits Times Index closed last week at 4,546.07 after hitting a new all-time high of 4,575.91, delivering a 25.8 per cent total return for the year to Nov 14. MAS also announced a "value unlock" programme to help listed companies "strengthen investor engagement and sharpen their focus on shareholder value creation". This includes S$30 million (US$23 million) allocated to two grants to build competencies in corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations, MAS said. MAS added that it had appointed a second batch of six more asset managers to the S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme – one of the several measures proposed by the review group to boost Singapore's stock market. From the remaining sum, S$2.85 billion has been allocated to Amova Asset Management, AR Capital, BlackRock, Eastspring Investments (Singapore), Lion Global Investors and Manulife Investment Management (Singapore). MAS appointed the first three asset managers in July to manage S$1.1 billion under the programme, which involves putting money with fund managers focused on investing in Singapore stocks. At the time, more than 100 global, regional and local firms had expressed interest in the programme. A total of S$3.95 billion has been allocated to nine asset managers. The central bank will continue to review the remaining submissions and the next phase of appointments is expected in the second quarter of 2026. The review group also announced other trading and market structure enhancements: To oversee the implementation of these measures, MAS will establish an Equity Market Implementation Committee, co-chaired by its managing director Chia Der Jiun and SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye. Adding that there has been "some encouraging development" since the review began in August 2024, Mr Chee said Singapore's equities market has performed well overall. "Building a stronger equities market, we know it cannot be done by any single organisation. There's no silver bullet to battle this set of challenges that we used to face," he added. The government wants to continue collaborating with industry partners going forward, to continue finding new growth areas for Singapore's financial services industry, especially in a more turbulent environment, said the minister. "But we must, while we're doing this, also remind ourselves that we've got to be prepared to take some risks, calculated risks," said Mr Chee. "We want to enhance the competitiveness of our ecosystem, we want to increase our chances of being able to implement transformative change. We may not always succeed." Mr David Gerald, president and CEO of the Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) lauded the "value unlock" initiatives, adding that listed companies are typically "very shy" about communicating with retail investors. He said the grants would help firms better train their officers to market their business growth journeys as well as their valuations and plans. This would encourage investors to look at how the company's stock is performing, he added. "Singapore companies are not having enough liquidity. If you can spur the local investors to do more for you, and if more companies come out and do these things and not hide behind annual reports ... they need to communicate more regularly." CEO of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID), Mr Terence Quek, said the moves by MAS will function as "a shot in the arm" for the local equities market and spark more interest in local-listed firms. The latest announcements show that the review group took a deep dive into the issue while listening to feedback from key stakeholders, including directors of listed entities, he added. "Boards and directors will also need to step up. SID will continue to play a key role in supporting boards with the capabilities, professionalism and governance standards they need to operate in this new landscape," said Mr Quek. To support the "value unlock" programme, SID will launch a series of programmes to help directors develop competencies in the area of corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations and stakeholder engagement, he added. The dual listing bridge makes it clear that Singapore is “going all out” to attract listings of large high-quality companies, said joint managing partner of TSMP Law Corporation Stefanie Yuen-Thio, who is a member of the Corporate Governance Advisory Committee. “With geopolitical tensions still running high, it makes sense for companies to develop an investor base on both sides of the world,” she added. An SGX and Nasdaq dual listing would provide 24-hour coverage and trading of stocks and “not make the listed company look too US-focused”, she said. The S$5 billion allocated to asset managers pumps “much needed” liquidity into lesser known but good quality stocks, said Ms Yuen-Thio. “It’s a good start but you cannot lift a market just by pumping in capital. You also need to equip companies, which is what the ‘value unlock’ program seeks to do.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app

US Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $3 billion in November outflows as a fresh death cross, fading Fed rate cut odds, and smart money shorts weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are closing in on $3 billion in net outflows for November, putting the products on track for their worst month yet after BlackRock’s fund logged its biggest day of redemptions on record. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs extended their five-day losing streak Tuesday, logging another $372 million in net negative outflows, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $523 million in outflows, marking its largest day of outflows since its debut in January 2024. The latest outflows bring November’s total to $2.96 billion, already making it the second-worst month for spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock alone accounted for $2.1 billion of those outflows. Another week of selling could push redemptions past the $3.56 billion seen in February, which would mark the weakest month for ETF flows despite the historical tendency for November to be one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $866M in second-worst day on record, but some analysts still bullish The ETF outflows have continued to mount despite investors expecting a month of upside for Bitcoin, based on historical data. November is the best month for Bitcoin’s historic returns, with BTC averaging a 41.22% rally during the month, according to CoinGlass data. Looking at other crypto funds, the Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $74.2 million in outflows on Tuesday, while the Solana (SOL) ETFs attracted $26.2 million in inflows, surpassing $421 million in total investments since launch, according to Farside Investors. Related: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin gains fall 39% as October crash pressures corporate treasuries Bitcoin printed this cycle’s fourth “death cross” last week, a technical chart pattern that emerges when an asset’s short-term price momentum indicators fall below the long-term trend. While it is historically considered a “bearish technical signal,” the death cross can also signal a macro bottom ahead of a strong reversal, depending on the wider economic context, Lacie Zhang, research analyst at Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph. Some of the crypto-specific concerns included a warning from Bitmine Immersion’s chairman, Tom Lee, who stated that two major market makers are facing financial deficits, explained the analyst. Meanwhile, markets are pricing in a 46% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut during the Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 10, down from 93.7% a month ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The development inspired a repositioning among the industry’s most successful traders, who are tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen’s blockchain intelligence platform, for a more short-term downside. Smart money traders have added $5.7 million worth of cumulative short positions in the past 24 hours, signaling downside expectations, as this cohort was net short on Bitcoin for $275 million, according to Nansen.

Title: The AI Bubble Is Bigger Than You Think
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/11/19/ai-bubble-bigger-than-you-think/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:15:00Z

One thing I’ve been tracking this year is the areas where Wall Street and Silicon Valley are going to war. Tech firms clearly want to become banking apps and receive special charters, private equity and crypto are jostling for position in worker 401(k) plans, and the tech right in general wants to supplant big banks as the go-to director of conservative business policy. That’s all still going on. But in one area, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are in sync: conjuring up sketchy credit deals that are pointing us toward another financial crash. More from David Dayen Last month, the big focus was “round-tripping,” the way that sundry AI and tech companies were investing in their own customers—with Nvidia giving AI companies the investment necessary to buy their graphics processing units (GPUs), and so on. But there’s a lot more to this story, tangled up with yet another rebrand by the former masters of the universe, from “shadow banks” without proper regulation into something boring and neutral-sounding: private credit. Ever since the advent of financial regulation, there have been companies that have attempted to evade the rules with creative branding. Private credit companies are non-banks that are trying to rebrand into a name that doesn’t tell everyone they are unregulated lending vehicles. The speculative financing of the artificial intelligence buildout is happening mostly in private credit, where assets under management hit $1.6 trillion in February and are likely higher today. The deals being made are perverse and irrational; there are huge mismatches between the life cycle of the assets being funded and the amount of time it will take to pay them off. Experts have been doing everything but picketing the stock exchange with signs that say “BUBBLE IN PROGRESS,” yet the country has so much sunk cost in the AI boom that the pathway feels inevitable. “We have sealed the deal on another financial crisis—the question is size,” said one former congressional staffer. I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS as simply as I can. The build-out of computing power for AI needs about $2 trillion in annual revenue by the end of the decade to justify the current and planned investment. It’s an insane amount of money, nobody has it—nobody may ever have it—and so everything being constructed now, from the GPUs needed to train AI models to the data centers housing them to the energy supplying those data centers, needs some creative financing. Big Tech companies have large cash flows, but the trillions needed are too steep even for them. Venture capital isn’t that interested in funding infrastructure either; while the God in the machine that may result from the AI build-out has potential for supercharged returns, data centers and power plants, by themselves, won’t get you there. Related: The AI ouroboros But investors are dying for this kind of investment opportunity, believing that a Big Tech–directed industrial policy will endure for years. Big Tech firms have historically not borrowed much, however, and though companies have issued twice as many bonds this year than at any time in the recent past, they would like to maintain strong credit ratings by limiting debt exposure. Smaller AI companies, meanwhile, don’t have the confidence of the markets to borrow hundreds of billions in capital. Enter the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV). A company pops up to build a data center, and they get an “anchor tenant” that’s a Big Tech firm. (Data centers rent their space to tenants; they are infrastructure, but they’re also like apartment buildings.) It finances the data center through debt sales, implicitly (or explicitly) promising that Big Tech firm payments will pass through to investors. This is the case with an SPV for Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center in Louisiana. Blue Owl, a private credit fund, owns the majority stake in the SPV; it put in a small amount of equity, and the SPV carries the debt. Meta has another 20 percent, which gives investors the confidence that they’ll get repaid without Meta having to put debt on its balance sheet. This has a side effect of highly rating these debt instruments, with “specialized” rating agencies doing much of the work, in ways that are more than suspicious. Blue Owl is a private credit fund, which again is an end run around financial regulations. These companies suck up money from investors, well over a trillion dollars according to The Wall Street Journal. Blue Owl has $295 billion on its own. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. It’s pitched as a bulletproof trade; Big Tech firms are locked into leases, and their payments will pay back the debt. But if that’s the case, why is Blue Owl, in the aftermath of a merger of two of its private credit funds, blocking redemptions in a way that will automatically give those investors 20 percent losses? As a traditional bank, that move would be akin to a bank run; this is just pissing off rich people who got into an arrangement with limited rights. But the warning signs are unmistakable. And it’s not limited to Blue Owl; covenants on corporate debt are gradually being rewritten to protect private credit in the event of a fallout. A great paper from the Center for Public Enterprise lays out additional alarms. Data centers are not lasting infrastructure, or at least the guts inside them aren’t. If the GPUs are working overtime to compute AI models, they may not last more than two years, and high-end AI firms will always want to upgrade to the latest version anyway. (By the way, our friends at Blue Owl are lending money to Elon Musk’s xAI to buy Nvidia GPUs.) But AI firms are extending their depreciation schedules for the GPUs; they’re saying they will last much longer than they likely will. That means overstated revenues, as companies have to purchase far more GPUs than they are admitting publicly, and thence possible financial disaster. Indeed, some of the smaller companies are using loans backed by their GPUs to purchase other GPUs. It also means that these hulking buildings, and the dedicated power plants some of them are constructing in the vicinity, are likely to become stranded assets when the site outlives its usefulness. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Did I mention the securitization? Data centers roll over from construction loans into asset-backed securities, where investors can pick a tranche based on their risk comfort. The CPE report says that 61 percent of the applicable securitizations in this market are coming from data centers. But again, these securitizations happen years into a rapidly depreciating asset. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Of course, the big problem at the end of this road is that there just isn’t enough expected cash flow to pay any of this off. OpenAI lost more than $11.5 billion last quarter, and wants to spend far more in future years. The potential revenue to make up the gap is not anywhere on the horizon. If the Chinese AI models that are more efficient at training—in part because it is possible to reconstruct LLM datasets by purchasing their output—break ahead of the U.S. counterparts, there’s not going to be any way to finance the growing pile of infrastructure and real estate assets being built. But the big AI firms have no interest in efficiency here. The same companies making the models are the ones who own the cloud computing firms that are pushing more compute to everyone. In fact, the money made from cloud compute is subsidizing the model training at Amazon and Microsoft and Google. Everyone is financing the expansion of everyone else. That’s a classic description of a bubble. There’s a whole middleman aspect to this as well, the “neoclouds” that build data centers on spec and rent them out. (CoreWeave is a terrifying debt-ridden entry in this genre.) But I think you get the picture. We have a 2000s housing bubble level of financial engineering on top of a 1920s level of private unregulated lending on top of something bigger than a 1990s internet (or 1870s railroad) level of technology and infrastructure build-out. It’s one bubble to rule them all. WHILE THIS PILE MAY BE CENTERED IN PRIVATE CREDIT, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, and other vehicles have pieces of it. A Moody’s report last month said that banks have at least $300 billion in loans to private credit. Blue Owl has BlackRock, Invesco, and PIMCO selling the bonds financing the Hyperion data center. Because this is the only thing moving in this economy, everyone on Wall Street wants some of the action, even those who are wary of it. Deutsche Bank, for example, is talking about reducing its exposure to data center risks, including by shorting AI stocks. But within that, the bank has acknowledged that some of its traders had “gone heavy” on financing for data centers. That puts the effort by Trump’s financial regulators to deregulate traditional banking, including the Federal Reserve slashing bank supervision, in a different light. It may be hard for a private credit firm to get bailed out by the government; for the banks, it’s easier. If banks soak up and carry over the debt from the Blue Owls of the world, they have better opportunities to have it effectively extinguished. So while the biggest names swap money back and forth to buy each other’s stuff, these special purpose vehicles and their investors could be left holding the bag. That increasingly could be ordinary retail investors with 401(k) plans. Financial policymakers I’ve talked to are perhaps most alarmed by this part. There are enough people in the know, like Peter Thiel, quietly sidling away from this investment/fiasco that nerves should be pretty frayed if you have any concern about the U.S. economy. Blue Owl’s stock is way down this year, as skepticism with private credit abounds; it fell 6 percent just on Monday. It’s not exactly comforting when Google’s CEO says “no company is going to be immune, including us” if the AI bubble bursts. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

November 19, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Platform reaches 2,400+ active co-owners and $320,000 in distributed passive income as institutional giants like BlackRock validate trillion-dollar tokenization opportunity PARIS, France, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation as Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization moves from experimental technology to mainstream financial infrastructure. With institutional projections estimating the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by the 2030s, platforms like Binaryx are demonstrating how blockchain-enabled fractional ownership is making previously inaccessible real estate investments available to a broader investor base. According to Deloitte research 'Tokenization of Real Estate: Unlocking New Opportunities (2024)', tokenized private real estate funds alone could achieve $1 trillion in value by 2035, while industry analysis suggests the broader tokenized asset market may reach $16 trillion or more within the decade. This shift has attracted major institutional players, with BlackRock targeting $10 trillion in tokenized assets and launching its BUIDL Fund on the Ethereum blockchain. "Tokenization isn't hype — it's infrastructure,". "When BlackRock talks trillions and launches products, this is no longer a pilot program. This represents a fundamental shift in how ownership, liquidity, and investment function in the 21st century." Binaryx: From Startup to 34 Tokenized Properties in Three Years Binaryx, a tokenized real estate platform, exemplifies this transformation in practice. In just three years, the platform has grown from five properties to 34 tokenized real estate assets across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, with: The platform has optimized its operational processes more than 10 times over three years, addressing traditional barriers to real estate co-ownership. Where conventional fractional ownership involves thousands of dollars in notarial and legal fees plus operational bureaucracy, Binaryx's DAO-LLC model significantly reduces these barriers. Liquidity: The Game-Changing Advantage Perhaps most significantly, Binaryx enables property share liquidity in approximately 40 minutes to one month — compared to the traditional 2-8 month timeline for real estate transactions. This liquidity advantage addresses one of the fundamental challenges of real estate investment while maintaining exposure to physical asset performance. "Real estate asset tokenization can allow institutional investors to create custom portfolios with tokens that match their investment thesis." by Deloitte. Institutional Validation Accelerates Market Maturity The entrance of institutional capital providers signals market maturity. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly identified tokenization as a key strategic direction, noting that private markets and digital assets are becoming entry points for new investor demographics. JPMorgan and Citi have similarly launched tokenization initiatives, integrating these instruments into their platforms. Market projections indicate compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 20-27% or higher for the tokenized asset sector, driven by: Addressing Risk and Regulatory Considerations Binaryx acknowledges the evolving regulatory landscape, noting that tokenized real estate often falls under securities regulations with jurisdiction-specific requirements⁹. The platform addresses these considerations through: "Technology enables new possibilities, but proper governance, transparent operations, and regulatory compliance remain essential," Oleg Kurchenko, CEO at Binaryx noted. "We've built infrastructure designed for long-term sustainability, not short-term hype." The Democratization of Real Estate Investment For investors, tokenization represents a hybrid instrument combining digital fractional ownership with real income potential — neither pure cryptocurrency speculation nor traditional real estate's capital intensity and illiquidity. "This is the democratization of finance we've discussed for years — actually happening," Oleg concluded. "Platforms like Binaryx prove this isn't theoretical. Properties are operational, income is flowing, and investors are participating in markets that would have been closed to them five years ago." About Binaryx Binaryx is a tokenized real estate investment platform enabling fractional ownership of international properties through blockchain technology. With 34 tokenized properties across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, Binaryx provides over 2,400 active investors access to real estate co-ownership with enhanced liquidity and reduced barriers to entry. Accessible via mobile app (iOS/Android) and web platform, Binaryx enables investors to browse properties, execute fractional investments, track rental income in real-time, and trade property shares with unprecedented ease and transparency. The platform utilizes DAO-LLC legal structures combined with blockchain tokenization to create accessible, transparent real estate investment opportunities for the global investor community.

Amid the second wave of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Solana (SOL)-based investment products have been leading the charge, fueled by strong demand despite the recent market volatility. As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Builds Strength for $120K, but Zero Knowledge Proof Becomes the New 100x Presale Everyone’s Rushing Into

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The cryptocurrency market is entering a defining moment. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to assert its dominance, supported by institutional accumulation and global ETF adoption. At the same time, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is drawing extraordinary attention as its whitelist is now live, introducing a privacy-first vision that could redefine blockchain infrastructure. Together, these two assets, one proven, one emerging, are shaping the narrative of 2025: stability and innovation. Bitcoin represents crypto’s established store of value; ZKP represents the new frontier of private computation and verifiable AI. BTC and ZKP sit on opposite ends of the maturity spectrum but share a common thread, sustained demand driven by utility and institutional interest. Bitcoin’s price performance in late 2025 reflects strong resilience. With macroeconomic uncertainty, fiat inflation, and record ETF inflows, BTC has reclaimed a leading position in risk markets. Analysts cite that Bitcoin is forming a base around $65,000–$70,000, with resistance near $74,000–$80,000, setting the stage for the next potential leg higher. Institutional interest remains the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s growth. Major entities, from BlackRock to Fidelity, have increased exposure through spot ETFs, driving demand that continually absorbs available supply. The 2024 halving has also compressed issuance, reducing daily mining output and pushing BTC closer to a structural supply crunch. Historically, each halving cycle has seen exponential returns within 12–18 months, and analysts at multiple research houses suggest that the Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 could realistically target $100,000–$120,000 if demand continues to rise and ETF participation deepens. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s 200-day moving average remains upward-sloping, a hallmark of bullish continuation. In the near term, BTC may face consolidation between $65,000–$75,000, but the macro structure favors expansion. A decisive breakout above $80,000 could trigger a new cycle phase, with momentum pushing toward six-figure territory. On the downside, the $58,000–$60,000 zone acts as major support, underpinned by whale accumulation and long-term holder conviction. Even in corrective phases, the structural supply scarcity and institutional demand floor keep downside risk relatively constrained. While Bitcoin dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is defining the next-generation narrative, privacy, AI, and decentralized computation. The ZKP whitelist is live now, and early engagement has been explosive, surpassing 200,000 registrations within the first 24 hours. ZKP’s framework revolves around zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling transactions and computations to be verified without exposing sensitive information. This architecture promises to bridge blockchain, artificial intelligence, and real-world data in a privacy-compliant manner, a theme increasingly sought after by enterprises and regulators alike. What makes ZKP exceptional is its foundation. The project was built with over $100 million in pre-launch, long before a single token was sold. It introduces an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) model, a fair and transparent alternative to conventional presales. Participants contribute daily and receive proportional allocations, ensuring inclusivity and eliminating insider advantages. This combination of real infrastructure, cryptographic rigor, and fair-access mechanics is why analysts are already calling Zero Knowledge Proof the next 100x crypto. The upcoming months could see ZKP become one of the best cryptos for 2025, as privacy and AI narratives converge into mainstream adoption. Analysts believe ZKP’s mix of real infrastructure, transparent tokenomics, and cryptographic innovation could make it the next viral blockchain trend, just as DeFi and layer-2s were in previous cycles. With its whitelist already oversubscribed, ZKP stands out as the most anticipated project in the emerging proof-based AI economy, where privacy and computation integrity become the ultimate currency of trust. Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) symbolize two complementary sides of the crypto revolution. Bitcoin is digital gold, a scarce, decentralized monetary asset recognized globally. ZKP, on the other hand, is a digital infrastructure, a system designed to preserve privacy while powering decentralized computation and AI verification. The combination of the two represents diversification between maturity and innovation. Bitcoin offers long-term store-of-value strength; ZKP provides high-growth exposure to next-gen blockchain technologies. While Bitcoin’s upside may appear steady and predictable, ZKP’s potential lies in early positioning. As its whitelist remains open, early contributors are effectively gaining front-row access to a project that could define how blockchains interact with AI, compliance, and confidential data in the years ahead. Together, they reflect where crypto is heading: one asset securing wealth, the other securing data. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 remains structurally bullish. With ETF inflows, halving-driven scarcity, and growing corporate adoption, BTC’s path toward $100,000–$120,000 appears plausible over the next year. Macro conditions, especially declining interest rates or renewed fiat devaluation, could serve as major accelerators. Simultaneously, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioning itself, fueled by its open whitelist, $100M infrastructure foundation, and a vision of verifiable, privacy-preserving computation. As ZKP prepares to go viral, it encapsulates the forward edge of blockchain evolution, one where privacy, proof, and AI converge into the next trillion-dollar narrative. Pairing Bitcoin’s resilience with ZKP’s innovation could represent the ultimate dual strategy: exposure to both proven value and the next major leap in blockchain utility.

Agent Vincent Finnegan is offering a high-profile residential site in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock for sale by tender at a guide price of €6 million. Located on Newtownpark Avenue and just 50m from the N11 quality bus corridor, the subject property, which extends to 0.65 hectares (1.6 acres), comprises two houses – Selandia and the Paddock – and an afterschool centre known as the Willow House Afterschool. The subject site is zoned Objective A under the terms of the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Development Plan 2022-2028. This objective supports residential development and residential amenities. A comprehensive planning appraisal of the site has been prepared by Hughes Planning and Development Consultants, and this provides specific advice on the prospect of securing planning permission for residential development, with an emphasis on apartment development. The report notes that a density of “up to 250 dwellings per hectare (162 units) could be considered where it [a planning proposal] meets the outlined development standards and safeguards the residential amenity of neighbouring properties”. It adds that “precedents in the area suggest a density closer to 165 dwellings per hectare (107 units) may be more in keeping with the established context”. The report further notes that the development plan “expresses a preference for retrofit and reuse [of existing properties] in the first instance”. It adds, however, that “there is a planning gain associated with increasing residential density on this site, and this would form a key part of the justification for demolition” notwithstanding the council’s focus on climate action. Any proposal for demolition would need to be robustly justified from an engineering, energy and planning perspective, the report concludes. The subject site is for sale by tender with the final date for receipt of tenders set for Friday, January 30th, 2026.

Title: Ethereum Price Will Bottom This Week, Predicts Tom Lee

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee says Ethereum is nearing a cyclical low, arguing that on-chain fundamentals and relative valuation versus Bitcoin indicate that ETH is “pretty close to bottoming this week.” “Personally, I think that we’re pretty close to bottoming this week,” Lee told CNBC, linking the current drawdown to a broader crypto correction that began after a sharp liquidation event on October 10. Despite that shock, he insisted that Ethereum’s core investment story remains intact. For Lee, that story centers on Ethereum as neutral infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoins, increasingly relevant as Wall Street intensifies its on-chain ambitions. “There are stablecoin creations. Larry Fink and BlackRock and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain. And they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That’s Ethereum. And that’s the fundamental story,” he said. Lee framed crypto’s extreme volatility as structurally tied to how the market values long-term innovation rather than as a sign of fundamental weakness. “The price, of course, for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hyper volatile. In fact, it’s kind of a… it’s sort of a feature of the blockchain itself,” he noted. “Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here.” He placed the current move in the context of a broader risk-off environment and a continuing correction across digital assets. According to Lee, macro data remains a crucial driver of crypto cycles, particularly for Bitcoin. “The most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it… at a peak actually is the ISM,” he said, referring to US activity surveys. “So I think we’re still in a correction phase of crypto.” Asked specifically what underpins his bullish view on Ethereum now, Lee pointed to two structural “floor” mechanisms. First, he cited the value of assets locked on the Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum kind of has several ways that it establishes a floor. One is the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain, and that number is growing,” he said. “Historically, Ethereum bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So I’d say we’re pretty close to that level. That’s why I think Ethereum is probably bottoming this week.” Second, he highlighted Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin, using both price and network value. “The other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at 0.032,” Lee said. “The long-term average, like the eight-year average, if we were just to trade to that eight-year average, would put Ethereum at around $12,000.” On that basis, Lee characterized Ethereum as undervalued versus its historical relationship with Bitcoin. “So I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain,” he argued. Summarizing Lee’s stance, the CNBC host concluded: “Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week.” Lee did not offer a specific price target or an exact day, but his message was clear: in his view, Ethereum is close to completing its correction as on-chain value and relative valuation metrics converge toward levels that have historically marked major bottoms. At press time, ETH traded at $3,018. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: Wondering Why The XRP Price Is Still Lagging Despite Record ETF Launch? Read This

The debut of Canary Capital’s spot-XRP ETF was one of the standout moments for the XRP community this year, bringing the token into the US ETF arena with strong opening volume and heavy attention from traders. Many holders went into launch week expecting that kind of headline event to push XRP into a sharp rally, especially after waiting years for regulated access in the United States. Instead, price action has stayed relatively muted, leaving a gap between expectations and reality. In a new 26-minute video shared on X, finance coach Coach JV tried to close that gap, breaking down why XRP has not exploded higher yet and what he believes holders should actually focus on. XRP’s Spot ETF has undoubtedly been a success, considering the amount of inflows it has had in its first two trading days. However, this has yet to translate into a surge in the price of XRP, as many traders had predicted and expected. Instead, XRP’s price action has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent days. A large part of this price downtrend is due to the wider decline in the crypto market. In his breakdown, Coach JV approached the XRP situation from a macroeconomic perspective. Rather than treating the ETF launch as an isolated trigger, he contextualized XRP’s current price behavior within the larger environment that financial markets are dealing with. A major theme of his outlook was the way people respond to hype. Coach JV stated plainly that the only way is to have discipline and a consistent plan. He did not build his message around chasing short-term excitement or reacting emotionally to price moves. His focus was on having a structure that an individual can stick to, regardless of whether XRP moves fast after the ETF launch or takes longer than many were expecting. Coach JV also addressed one of the most common questions circulating in the community: whether $5 is the next big target for XRP now that an ETF is live. “Is $5 next? I don’t know; I’m not banking on that, I’m not waiting for it, I believe it’s going to happen at some point, and I have my exit strategy set up,” he said. That tone is now being echoed by others in the community who are pushing back against unrealistic targets. Zach Rector recently reminded his audience that XRP is not heading toward triple-digit prices this year, despite widespread speculation. Another commentator, known as Xoom on X, made a similar remark, saying XRP will not reach $100 or even $10 on ETF momentum alone. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18, down by 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Why Adam Backs thinks Bitcoin’s 20-year quantum runway matters more than today’s headlines

Bitcoin faces "probably not" any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For years, quantum computing has served as cryptocurrency’s favorite doomsday scenario, a distant but existential threat that periodically resurfaces whenever a lab announces a qubit milestone. The narrative follows a predictable arc where researchers achieve some incremental breakthrough, social media erupts with “Bitcoin is dead” predictions, and the news cycle moves on. But Adam Back’s November 15 remarks on X cut through that noise with something the discourse desperately lacks: a timeline grounded in physics rather than panic. Back, the Blockstream CEO, whose Hashcash proof-of-work system predates Bitcoin itself, responded to a question about accelerating quantum research with a blunt assessment. Bitcoin faces “probably not” any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. More importantly, he stressed that Bitcoin doesn’t have to wait passively for that day. NIST has already standardized quantum-secure signature schemes, such as SLH-DSA, and Bitcoin can adopt these tools through soft-fork upgrades long before any quantum machine poses a genuine threat. His comment reframes quantum risk from an unsolvable catastrophe into a solvable engineering problem with a multi-decade runway. That distinction matters because Bitcoin’s actual vulnerability isn’t where most people think, as the threat doesn’t come from SHA-256, the hash function that secures the mining process. It comes from ECDSA and Schnorr signatures on the secp256k1 elliptic curve, the cryptography that proves ownership. A quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could solve the discrete logarithm problem on secp256k1, deriving a private key from a public key and invalidating the entire ownership model. In pure mathematics, Shor’s algorithm renders elliptic curve cryptography obsolete. But mathematics and engineering exist in different universes. Breaking a 256-bit elliptic curve requires somewhere between 1,600 and 2,500 logical, error-corrected qubits. Each logical qubit demands thousands of physical qubits to maintain coherence and correct errors. One analysis, based on the work of Martin Roetteler and three other researchers, calculates that breaking a 256-bit EC key within the narrow time window relevant to a Bitcoin transaction would require approximately 317 million physical qubits under realistic error rates. It is essential to consider where quantum hardware actually stands. Caltech’s neutral-atom system operates around 6,100 physical qubits, but these are noisy and lack error correction. More mature gate-based systems from Quantinuum and IBM operate in the tens to low hundreds of logical-quality qubits. The gap between current capability and cryptographic relevance spans several orders of magnitude, not a small incremental step, but a chasm that requires fundamental breakthroughs in qubit quality, error correction, and scalability. NIST’s own post-quantum cryptography explainer states this plainly: no cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists today, and expert estimates for its arrival vary so widely that some specialists think “less than 10 years” remains a possibility. In contrast, others place it firmly past 2040. The median view clusters around the mid-to-late 2030s, making Back’s 20-to-40-year window conservative rather than reckless. Back’s “Bitcoin can add over time” comment points toward concrete proposals already circulating among developers. BIP-360, titled “Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash,” defines new output types where spending conditions include both classical signatures and post-quantum signatures. A single UTXO becomes spendable under either scheme, allowing for a gradual migration rather than a hard cutoff. Jameson Lopp and other developers have built on BIP-360 with a multi-year migration plan. First, add PQ-capable address types via soft fork. Then gradually encourage or subsidize moving coins from vulnerable outputs into PQ-protected ones, reserving some block space each block specifically for these “rescue” moves. Academic work dating back to 2017 has already recommended similar transitions. A 2025 preprint from Robert Campbell proposes hybrid post-quantum signatures, where transactions carry both ECDSA and PQ signatures during an extended transition period. The user-side picture reveals why this matters. Roughly 25% of all Bitcoin, between four and six million BTC, sits in address types where public keys are already exposed on-chain. Early pay-to-public-key outputs from Bitcoin’s first years, reused P2PKH addresses, and some Taproot outputs all fall into this category. These coins become immediate targets once Shor on secp256k1 becomes practical. Modern best practice already provides substantial protection. Users who employ fresh P2PKH, SegWit, or Taproot addresses without reusing them benefit from a critical timing advantage. For these outputs, the public key remains hidden behind a hash until the first spend, compressing the attacker’s window to run Shor within the mempool confirmation period, measured in minutes rather than years. The migration job isn’t starting from scratch, it’s building upon existing good practices and transitioning legacy coins into safer structures. Back’s mention of SLH-DSA wasn’t casual name-dropping. In August 2024, NIST finalized the first wave of post-quantum standards: FIPS 203 ML-KEM for key encapsulation, FIPS 204 ML-DSA for lattice-based digital signatures, and FIPS 205 SLH-DSA for stateless hash-based digital signatures. NIST also standardized XMSS and LMS as stateful hash-based schemes, with the lattice-based Falcon scheme in the pipeline. Bitcoin developers now have a menu of NIST-approved algorithms, along with reference implementations and libraries. Bitcoin-focused implementations already support BIP-360, indicating that the post-quantum toolbox exists and continues to mature. The protocol doesn’t need to invent brand-new mathematics, it can adopt established standards that have undergone years of cryptanalysis. That doesn’t mean implementation comes without challenges. A 2025 paper examining SLH-DSA found susceptibility to Rowhammer-style fault attacks, emphasizing that while security rests on ordinary hash functions, implementations still require hardening. Post-quantum signatures also consume more resources than their classical counterparts, raising questions about transaction sizes and the economics of fees. But these represent engineering problems with known parameters, not unsolved mathematical mysteries. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) amended its prospectus in May 2025 to include extensive disclosures about quantum computing risk, warning that a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptography. Analysts immediately recognized this as standard risk-factor disclosure, boilerplate language alongside generic technology and regulatory risks, rather than a signal that BlackRock expects imminent quantum attacks. The near-term threat is investor sentiment, rather than the technology of quantum computing itself. A 2025 SSRN study found that news related to quantum computing triggers some rotation into explicitly quantum-resistant coins. Still, conventional cryptocurrencies exhibit only modest negative returns and volume spikes around such news, rather than structural repricing. When examining what actually drove Bitcoin’s movement throughout 2024 and 2025, going through ETF flows, macroeconomic data, regulation, and liquidity cycles, quantum computing rarely appears as a proximate cause. CPI prints, ETF outflow days, and regulatory shocks drive price action, while quantum computing generates headlines. Even articles sounding the loudest alarms about “25% of Bitcoin at risk” frame the threat as years away while emphasizing the need to start upgrading now. The framing consistently lands on “governance and engineering problem” rather than “sell immediately.” Bitcoin’s quantum story isn’t really about whether a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives in 2035 or 2045. It’s about whether the protocol’s governance can coordinate upgrades before that date becomes relevant. Every serious analysis converges on the same conclusion that the time to prepare is now, precisely because migration takes a decade, not because the threat is imminent. The question that will determine Bitcoin’s quantum resilience is whether developers can build consensus around BIP-360 or similar proposals, whether the community can incentivize migration of legacy coins without fracturing, and whether communication can stay grounded enough to prevent panic from outrunning physics. In 2025, quantum computing poses a governance challenge that necessitates a 10- to 20-year roadmap, rather than a catalyst that will dictate this cycle’s price action. Physics advances slowly, and a roadmap is visible. Bitcoin’s role is to adopt PQ-ready tools well before the hardware arrives, and to do so without the governance gridlock that can turn a solvable problem into a self-inflicted crisis.

Title: Bitcoin recovery expected as liquidity conditions change, but US macro remains a threat

Bitcoin’s recent weakness reflects broader economic stress, but improving liquidity and investors’ positive outlook for 2026 could set the stage for a strong rebound. Key takeaways: Federal Reserve balance-sheet limits and possible repo operations point to improving liquidity conditions that could boost Bitcoin and other risk assets. Fiscal strain and sector weakness currently weigh on markets, but easing tariffs and a targeted stimulus plan may support a recovery in crypto demand. Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could remain under pressure ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Dec. 10. Expectations for the direction of monetary policy remain highly split, with concerns over inflation clashing against signs of slowing economic activity. Traders are divided between a 0.25% cut and keeping rates steady at 4%, based on implied odds on government bond markets. The more cautious Fed members argue that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have added inflation pressure, reducing the room to ease rates and support growth. At the same time, the US job market shows clear signs of cooling, according to reports from BlackRock. Concerns with sticky inflation have been regularly cited by Fed officials. “I worry that restrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is affecting lower-and middle-income consumers,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday. Waller dismissed rumors that the missing official data, resulting from the government shutdown, has hurt the Fed’s visibility. Still, blaming Bitcoin’s weakness only on the Fed seems inaccurate, given that the downtrend started in early October. US import tariffs helped narrow the monthly government deficit, and the Fed’s balance sheet continued to shrink, causing the US dollar to strengthen against a basket of major currencies. Historically, Bitcoin holds an inverse correlation to the dollar index (DXY). Pinpointing the exact trigger behind Bitcoin’s weakness since the Oct. 6 all-time high is nearly impossible. Financial conditions worsened as freight activity slowed, housing markets softened and companies faced tighter cash flows, according to a Savvy Wealth report. As a result, Bitcoin’s decline may stem more from broad risk aversion than from dollar strength alone. The Fed has signaled that it will no longer allow its assets under management to fall below the current $6.5 trillion, starting in December. This move could be offset by the launch of repurchase agreement (repo) operations. In practice, the Fed’s balance sheet stays unchanged while cash is injected into financial markets, easing liquidity concerns by adding reserves to banks. Meanwhile, Trump has directed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to prepare a stimulus campaign aimed at lower-income households for early 2026, and import tariffs may be gradually reduced to lower inflation risks. Still, fiscal conditions worsen in 2026 as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes effect. By the start of the year, there should be far less uncertainty in the economic outlook, for better or worse. Currently, weaknesses are evident in the real estate and auto sectors, both of which are placing significant pressure on regional banks. Bitcoin and other riskier assets have already reacted defensively, but they stand to benefit the most once liquidity returns. Related: Bitcoin charts flag $75K bottom, but analysts predict 40% rally before 2025 ends Bitcoin is not hostage to US monetary policy, especially with a weakening job market. The Fed has limited room to act while fiscal conditions stay tight, leaving expansionist measures as its fallback. Over time, liquidity is expected to return to markets, helping to mitigate a sharper economic impact and creating a more favorable environment for a strong rally in scarce assets.

A VIGIL IN Co Monaghan has called on the local community to be a “pillar of strength” after five young adults died in a collision in Co Louth over the weekend. Three separate vigils were arranged this evening, with one in Ardee, Co Louth; Drumconrath, Co Meath; and Aughnamullen, Co Monaghan; to pay tribute to the deceased. The victims in the crash were: Chloe McGee, 23, and Shay Duffy, 21, both from Carrickmacross in Co Monaghan; Alan McCluskey, 23, from Drumconrath in Co Meath; Dylan Commins, 23, from Ardee in Co Louth; and Chloe Hipson, 21, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland. They were travelling together in a Volkswagen Golf while on their way to Dundalk for a night out when they died in the crash on Saturday. A sixth person who was in the car, also aged in his 20s, was taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries and has since been released from hospital. Two other people were also injured in what gardaí described as a “shocking and devastating” crash. The incident, which involved the Golf and a Toyota Land Cruiser, happened on a road near Dundalk just after 9pm. Post-mortem examinations of the deceased have now been completed and their remains have been released to their families. The two occupants of the Toyota Landcruiser, a man and a woman in their 20s, remain in hospital where they continue to receive medical treatment for non-life threatening injuries. At the vigil in Aughnamullen, Co Monaghan, Chloe McGee’s cousin delivered a beautiful rendition of ‘Amazing Grace’. Hundreds gathered on a cold evening to remember the Aughnamullen ladies footballer. Flowers left at vigil for Chloe McGee Diarmuid Pepper / The Journal Diarmuid Pepper / The Journal / The Journal The vigil heard that Chloe was a “stellar” defender in the Aughnamullen ladies football team and at the heart of the team. The vigil was told of one incident where Chloe managed to get a score despite being a defender and jokingly told the management that they could call her Colm ‘Gooch’ Cooper from now on. “That sums her up and her outlook on life – she got stuck in to get the hard work done but could have the craic and a laugh at the same time,” said Annie Hanaway of Aughnamullen GAA. “She was a beautiful girl, inside and out, and anytime you met her you were greeted with the friendliest smile and the biggest ‘hello’.” PJ Markey, Chair of Augnamullen GAA, remarked that the crowd had gathered with “heavy hearts and united in sorrow to honour a life that has been tragically cut short”. He said the incident has sent “ripples of pain throughout every corner of our community”. “It is in moments like this that the true meaning of community, of being part of something bigger than ourselves, is laid bare. “Our GAA club has always been more than just a place to play games – it’s a family, a place of shared triumphs and now of shared grief.” He extended his sympathies to Chloe’s friends who died in the collision and said Aughnamullen GAA club “will stand with them not just today, but tomorrow and in all the days to come.” “We are a community and we always stick together. Let us now be that pillar of strength for each other, let us lean on one another, offer a hand, a listening ear, a comforting word. Advertisement “Our community spirit is the very foundation of Aughnamullen GAA club and it will help us through this tragedy. We will find strength in our unity.” Meanwhile, local priest Owen Gordan asked those gathered to pray for those who survived the collision, as well as the deceased. He prayed for them to find healing “both in body and in soul” and asked that their “memories of what happened neither cause them pain nor torment”. “Enable them to rebuild their lives with their loved ones,” he added. Fr Gordon also prayed for all the emergency services involved and asked that “be comforted when work brings tragedy their way”. Elsewhere, at Drumconrath Gaelic Football Club, hundreds gathered with candles and mobile flashlights.

Some of those gathered wiped away tears as songs were played in tribute to those affected while the congregation also said a decade of the rosary.

Fr Finian Connaughton told the Drumconrath grouping that they were just “one community of five communities in a state of shock”. He said while people may feel that there is nothing that can be done, this is not true as the community coming together was an expression of support to those affected. He said he was confident that the McCluskeys and other affected families are “very well aware” that people are gathering and praying for them. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Hundreds more gathered at the back of Sean McDermott’s GFC in Ardee where Rev Dermot Clarke, Deacon of the parish of Haggardstown and Blackrock, was in attendance and led the candlelight service. Those present prayed for those who died that had “so much to live for” as well as those still recovering in hospital. Rev Clarke said the community had gathered in “shock, grief and confused hearts”. He said the vigil meant “a lot to everyone here”, and showed solidarity to the affected families. “As a club, as a community, as a parish, we all are one together.” In prayer, he added: “We ask you to keep everyone safe and in your love as we approach Christmas, a special time for young children, and when we will have families who have people missing from the table this year, we ask you to give them Meanwhile, gardai continue to investigate all the circumstances behind the crash and issued a renewed witness appeal. -With additional reporting from Press Association Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

A vigil is held at Drumconrath GFC, Co Meath (Photo: Cillian Sherlock/PA Wire) At Drumconrath Gaelic Football Club, hundreds gathered with candles and mobile flashlights for a vigil on a cold, dark and windy night. The club’s flag was flown at half mast as prayers were offered to the McCluskey family, the others injured and killed in the crash as well as the emergency services who responded to the scene. Some of those gathered wiped away tears as songs were played in tribute to those affected while the congregation also said a decade of the rosary. A table carrying photographs of Mr McCluskey was also on display. Fr Finian Connaughton told the Drumconrath grouping that they were just "one community of five communities in a state of shock". He said while people may feel that there is nothing that can be done, this is not true as the community coming together was an expression of support to those affected. He said he was confident that the McCluskeys and other affected families are "very well aware" that people are gathering and praying for them. Today's News in 90 - Tuesday November 18 Hundreds more gathered at the back of Sean McDermott's GFC in Ardee where Rev Dermot Clarke, Deacon Parish of Haggardstown and Blackrock, was in attendance and led the candlelight service. Meanwhile, gardaí continue to investigate all the circumstances behind the crash and issued a renewed witness appeal.

Written by Danny Klein | November 18, 2025 - 1:29 pm Off the Grid Campout founder, visionary and DJ Mikey Made has been on a mission to foster community in the SoCal dance music scene for over a decade. In the past few years, he’s expanded OTG’s footprint from Austin to Mexico City and many points in between. He’s acquired his own remote festival getaway – a sacred outdoor space dotted with Joshua Trees, only 2.5 hours from LA, as well as a new rave-ready warehouse in Santa Ana. Made has also brought The Scarab and The Cloud art cars to the likes of Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Hearts, and more. Each production is ideated and built by Made’s True Crew, a group of live event creatives (many of whom are also DJ’s) that come together for each unique build, whether it’s on home turf or under the often crazy conditions in Blackrock City. OTG events are not about VIP lists or hierarchy. There’s a palpable sense of equality and open access, which isn’t always found at today’s festivals. “This is all for you.” – Mikey Made From early roots throwing remote renegade desert raves with a few dozen friends, to celebrating 10 years in the game with a flagship 4-day festival, the journey has not always been easy. Maintaining harmony in an ecosystem of countless collectives, artists and promoters is always a challenge, but at the end of the day, the unforgettable sets, new friendships, and endless good vibes till the sun comes up make it all worth-while. From international touring legends, to today’s hottest trailblazers, to platforming rising talent that might otherwise not get a shot at the big stage, Made takes great care in curating his lineups, covering a wide range of house, techno, and drum and bass subgenres.

Title: NY Gov. Kathy Hochul enlists Wall Street execs to talk Trump out of sending National Guard to NYC: report

Time Published: 2025-11-18T17:18:09Z
Full Content:
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is reportedly teaming up with Wall Street executives in an effort to talk President Trump out of sending National Guard troops to New York City in the wake of socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory earlier this month. A top aide to Hochul, a Dem, has reached out to leaders of the Big Apple’s finance industry in hopes of convincing the Republican Trump administration to refrain from deploying federal troops to the city — arguing that doing so would harm the economy, according to The Wall Street Journal. Jackie Bray, Hochul’s director of homeland security and emergency services, is spearheading the effort and has reportedly met one-on-one with top executives in New York to get their buy-in. According to The Journal, Bray shared data with executives showing that National Guard troop deployments would harm local businesses, as well as tourism. Hochul’s team has yet to ask business leaders to convey the concerns directly to Trump since there is no immediate threat of a federal takeover, the publication reported. Along with sending the National Guard to the city, Trump has reportedly weighed funding cuts in response to Mamdani’s shocking victory. The mayor-elect has promised to stop all cooperation with federal authorities on combating illegal immigration — restoring New York’s status to what he called the “strongest sanctuary city” in the country. The Post has sought comment from the White House and Hochul. New York State officials are trying to follow the example of San Francisco, where Democratic Mayor Daniel Luri enlisted the helpf of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce boss Marc Benioff. The billionaire tech moguls reportedly managed to persuade Trump to stand down from his original plan to send National Guard troops into the city earlier this year. Trump recently hosted some of finance’s most powerful figures — including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, hedge fund mogul Bill Ackman and BlackRock chief Larry Fink — at the White House. The Post was the first to report that Trump picked their brains for ideas on how to make things more affordable for everyday Americans. Among the corporate leaders who took part in the meeting were Morgan Stanley’s Ted Pick, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman. Since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has ordered deployments of National Guard units and federal law enforcement to several major US cities — mostly Dem-led. He’s said the moves are needed to address violent crime, homelessness, illegal immigration and protests. The deployments in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis have triggered legal challenges and sharp criticism from state and local officials who argue the moves overstep presidential authority.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A train of SpaceX's Starlink satellites caught on camera above Auckland. Photo / Sky Photography Ltd Should we be thinking more broadly about sustainability, rather than just how it relates to climate emissions? Fran O’Sullivan introduces the Sustainable Business and Finance Report. Billionaire Elon Musk plans to use Starlink technology to create AI data centres in space. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) Musk said Starship could deliver 100GW/year to high Earth orbit within 4 to 5 years “if we can solve the other parts of the equation”. “100TW/year is possible from a lunar base producing solar-powered AI satellites locally and accelerating them to escape velocity with a mass driver.” It all sounds a bit “sci-fi”, right from the playbook of space visionary Gerard K. O’Neill, author of The High Frontier, perhaps? But Musk and SpaceX plan to connect data centres in orbit by scaling up next-generation Starlink V3 satellites connected through high-speed laser links to form a decentralised computing network. What’s driving this is the need to power the increasing computational demands of the disruptive artificial intelligence technologies fast transforming business and economies. AI data centres suck up a great deal of electrical power. This is one reason why nuclear power is back in vogue to reduce the need for more fossil-fuelled electricity grids. But nuclear comes with a very large price tag. The beauty of putting AI data centres in orbit is that they are powered by continuous sunlight and cooled by radiating their heat into deep space. Their protagonists predict space-based data centres would use less energy, zero fresh water, and far lower emissions than their terrestrial counterparts. Others have joined the race. Starcloud co-founders Philip Johnston, Ezra Feilden, and Adi Oltean built a working prototype in just 15 months, making history by launching a satellite with an NVIDIA H100 into orbit — the first time a GPU that powerful has ever operated in space. It all sounds so simple - and perhaps it is. CarbonBrief reports data centres are very geographically concentrated, both in terms of their global distribution and within leading countries. Today, nearly half of their electricity consumption takes place in the US, 25% in China and 15% in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It’s still a first-world problem. Data centres are now responsible for just over 1% of global electricity demand and 0.5% of CO2 emissions, according to IEA data. The world is entering what the IEA describes as a “new age of electricity”, in which the electrification of transport, buildings and industry drives a surge in demand for power. It’s only in recent decades that solar-powered grids have become run of the mill along with electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles — so this is very possible. Problem is, this is all at a margin. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to ‘humanity’s demise’. We’re now in a world where the very idea of national sustainability is an issue. Indigenous people rioting at COP30 in Brazil are at the sharp end. As we report today, significant New Zealand businesses are wedded to doing their part to address the climate challenge. But the Government is now under fire for taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to prosecuting the need to make deeper inroads towards “net zero” carbon emissions. Climate Change Minister Simon Watts has the unenviable challenge of fronting the Government’s position against charges of back-pedalling by his Labour opponent Deborah Russell and incisive academic analysis on that score. The emissions trading scheme is not a busted flush but it is increasingly looking more logical to have a simple carbon tax. Sustainability is a relatively simple concept in the business world. Perhaps we should be thinking more broadly than how it relates to climate emissions. In a thought-provoking article, Alex Worker raises the question of the sustainability of farmers’ incomes in a Kiwi food-producing industry increasingly subject to foreign takeover. If our farmers become price-takers and miss out on substantial profits accruing to international owners where does that leave the economy longer-term? Fonterra remains a New Zealand-owned co-operative. But other firms are increasingly passing to 100% outside control or into mixed ownership. There are other vulnerabilities. The management of New Zealand’s freshwater resource is critical and that has yet to play out so all interests are taken into account. Energy security is another area where confidence has eroded. Escalating electricity prices have sparked the closure of a number of manufacturing plants in Nelson and the Central North Island. Natural gas supplies are running down. The Government has yet to comprehensively address this. Overshadowing these domestic concerns are the challenges to ESG (environment, social, governance) norms in a world where national security has been challenged by the invasion of Ukraine. European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. Some key climate influencers are now recalcitrants. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to “humanity’s demise”, and the global strategy should shift its focus to other areas like disease control. Formerly a leading proponent for carbon emissions reductions, Gates now argues climate change is not going to wipe out humanity and past efforts that strive for achieving zero carbon emissions have made little real progress. In the United States, BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink has also shifted emphasis. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with US$12.5 trillion assets under management as of 2025. In his latest letter, Fink’s prior focuses on sustainability, climate change, and diversity, equity and inclusion were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Fink’s new themes are all about energy pragmatism and stakeholder capitalism. Tell that to the COP30 protesters. Click here for more Sustainable Business & Finance stories.

Title: What Binance’s Latest Partnership With BlackRock’s BUIDL Means For Crypto

Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:30:11Z
Full Content:
Crypto exchange Binance has announced that BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, will now be accepted as collateral on the platform. This comes as the tokenized fund expands to the BNB chain, a move welcomed by the exchange’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Binance has partnered with BlackRock’s BUIDL to expand its collateral offerings for institutional off-exchange settlement services, Binance Banking Triparty, and MirrorRSV. The exchange has now added support for BUIDL, which is a tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury fund. The exchange explained that its Banking Triparty is a custodial solution designed for institutions that separates asset custody from trading execution. With this, users can trade on the crypto platform by pledging fiat or fiat-equivalent collateral such as BlackRock’s BUIDL, which a regulated third-party banking partner will hold. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange also explained that MirrorRSV is an off-exchange custody solution provided by Ceffu, its institutional crypto custody partner. MirrorRSV allows users to trade on Binance while the assets remain in segregated cold wallets and can be verified on-chain. The exchange noted that this gives institutions enhanced transparency and auditability while retaining access to the exchange’s liquidity. This move is expected to boost institutional crypto adoption, as these options are meant to provide easy access to the crypto space. Binance also announced that BlackRock’s BUIDL will launch on the BNB Chain, further enhancing access and interoperability across on-chain applications. The tokenized fund is already supported on the Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Aptos networks. The fund is also available on Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao commented on BlackRock BUIDL’s partnership with Binance and its launch on BNB. He welcomed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to the crypto platform and the BNB Chain, noting that BlackRock manages $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), making the deal a major one for crypto. Notably, Franklin Templeton, which has $1.53 trillion in AUM, also recently launched its tokenization platform, BENJI, on BNB. Binance stated that through the BlackRock BUIDL integration, its institutional users can now hold the tokenized fund off-exchange with Ceffu and Binance’s regulated, third-party banking partners. That way, they will be able to earn yield on their collateral while also trading on the crypto exchange. The crypto exchange added that this move will effectively address user needs, enable confident scaling of allocations, and ensure regulatory compliance. BlackRock’s BUIDL joins other supported yield-bearing assets on Binance, which include USYC and cUSDO, which were integrated earlier this year. Crypto pundit Coachty noted that the partnership is TradFi-crypto convergence in real time. He added that BUIDL is becoming the go-to institutional asset in the tokenization boom and that the flow of capital into on-chain RWAs is only getting started.

Title: Fidelity’s Spot Solana ETF FSOL Expected to Go Live on November 18

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Fidelity is scheduled to launch its Solana ETF today, November 18, after which the Canary Capital fund will follow. Fidelity is preparing to debut its spot Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) following VanEck, which rolled out a similar fund on November 17. The Solana ETF competition is heating up gradually as two other asset management firms have also launched their SOL ETF a few weeks earlier. Overall, there is still a conversation on whether BlackRock will join this race for altcoin ETFs. Fidelity is expected to launch its spot Solana ETF on November 18, coming fourth after VanEck. According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the asset manager has pegged the management fee for the fund at 0.25%. It is worth noting that reputable firm BlackRock has not filed any application for a Solana ETF or any other altcoin ETF, for that matter. On this basis, Balchunas said Fidelity has a great chance to be the biggest asset manager in this ETF category. His colleague, James Seyffart, noted that Canary Capital is also set to launch its Solana ETF, under the ticker SOLC. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 The fund, which is scheduled to roll out on November 19, is a collaborative effort with Marinade Finance. This latter firm will be charged with the staking aspect of the fund. With Fidelity in the “game” and the traction that this fund is beginning to get, it’s still not clear if BlackRock will make a move towards the SOL ETF. On October 28, Bitwise’s BSOL became the first US spot Solana ETP as it commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market. Many market observers and analysts described the debut as a historic milestone for regulated crypto access. Grayscale’s SOL ETF followed the next day. So far, Bitwise’s BSOL has secured $450 million in trading volume. On November 17, VanEck rolled out a Solana Staking ETF for trading on Chicago’s CBOE with zero fees, even though it was the first issuer to apply to list this fund in June 2024. All fees will remain waived until February 2026, after which investors will be required to pay the 0.30% sponsor fees.

Title: Man (25) continues to be questioned over killing of woman near Cork home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/11/18/man-25-continues-to-be-questioned-over-killing-of-woman-near-cork-home/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T13:11:36Z
Full Content:
Gardaí are continuing to question a 25-year-old man about the killing of a woman and a knife attack on her husband near their Co Cork home on Monday night. Stella Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her husband, Brian (63), seriously injured when they were attacked by a man armed with a knife at their detached two-storey home in Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough at about 9pm. It is understood the couple fled their home, Ms Gallagher going in to a neighbour’s house to escape the attacker while Mr Gallagher tried to distract the man, who picked up a flowerpot and smashed a window in the neighbour’s house to try to gain entry. Ms Gallagher fled the neighbour’s house and Mr Gallagher again tried to divert the attacker away from his wife. However, he was attacked by the man and suffered a number of knife wounds to the upper body, including a very serious slash wound to his neck. It is understood the attacker then pursued Ms Gallagher to a green area about 45m (50 yards) from their home where he caught up with her and stabbed her a number of times, resulting in her suffering a number of catastrophic injuries. Neighbours had raised the alarm and members of the Garda Armed Support Unit (ASU) were first on the scene. Some of the ASU officers detained the man, who had discarded the knife, as other officers began performing CPR on the injured couple. HSE advanced paramedics quickly arrived and took over the care of the couple before they rushed them by ambulance to Cork University Hospital (CUH) where both underwent surgery. However, Ms Gallagher succumbed to her injuries and died some time before midnight. Mr Gallagher was described on Tuesday as being in a stable but serious condition. Gardaí hope to be given permission by CUH doctors to speak to him over the coming days as they try to piece together the sequence of events leading up to the attack. Both the Gallaghers were chemical engineers who had retired in recent years. Mr Gallagher had retired from PM Group, where he was a company director, and Ms Gallagher from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, where she worked under her maiden name, Stella Griffin. It is understood that Ms Gallagher had taken a five-year career break from Eli Lilly some years back for family reasons and then returned to work for around two years before her retirement from the company two years ago. The couple have one daughter and three sons in their 20s. The eldest, Ciara, is a doctor in Australia and she and the youngest, Mark, a student in Amsterdam, are on their way home while their middle sons, David and Conor, were both in Cork when the tragedy happened. Mr Gallagher is a native of Blackrock in Co Louth and Ms Gallagher is from Ballinspittle in west Cork. In the 1980s she attended what was then the Cork Institute of Technology (now the Munster Technological University) where she obtained a BSc in chemical engineering. Gardaí arrested a 25-year-old suspect, who was known to the Gallaghers, at the scene and he was conveyed to the Bridewell Garda station for questioning. He was detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act which allows gardaí to detain suspects for up to 24 hours. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster carried out a postmortem on the body of Ms Gallagher at CUH and while the Garda has not released the results for operational reasons, it confirmed she had been the victim of a violent knife attack. Garda technical experts spent much of the day examining the Gallaghers’ home, the home of their neighbour and the green area where Ms Gallagher was attacked. They also recovered a kitchen knife which they believe was used in the fatal assault.

Title: Tom Lee Ascribes Ethereum’s Pain to Market-Makers, Not the Fed | US Crypto News
URL: https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-market-downturn-liquidation-event/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T12:41:09Z

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in, because the latest crypto pullback may not be what it seems, at least according to BitMine chair Tom Lee. Beneath the headlines and market jitters, a far more unexpected force may be driving Ethereum’s slump, one that has little to do with the Fed, and everything to do with crypto’s own plumbing. Ethereum may be suffering from one of its sharpest drawdowns of the year, but Fundstrat’s Tom Lee argues the real culprit is not the Federal Reserve (Fed). Rather, it is a sudden liquidity shock inside crypto itself. Speaking in a new interview, Lee said the October 10 washout unleashed the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out players and potentially crippling key market-makers, creating what he calls a form of “crypto QT.” According to the BitMine chair, the market’s weakness stems from a combination of macro fear and internal structural stress. “There was this big liquidation event on October 10. One that really was a larger liquidation event than anything seen in history,” he explained. At the same time, crypto’s sensitivity to the interest-rate outlook has kept traders skittish. “If you end up with a hawkish Fed, it gets crypto investors very nervous.” However, for Ethereum specifically, Lee believes the more important factor is the quiet disappearance of crucial liquidity providers following the wipeout. “It does have the signs of that maybe a market maker or two actually is unable to provide market liquidity, and as you know, as liquidity contracts, it’s the same thing as the central bank tightening. So it’s almost like Crypto Qt,” he said. This internal liquidity drought, Lee argues, is why prices have lagged. “It does take a few weeks for the industry to sort of find its footing, and I think that’s why crypto prices have lagged here.” Despite the stress, Lee remains adamant that Ethereum is in the early stages of a long-term Supercycle. Perhaps this is why BitMine continues to accumulate, as reported in a recent US Crypto News publication. He points to surging activity across stablecoins, RWA tokenization, prediction markets, and emerging digital identity rails, most of which depend on Ethereum or its Layer 2 ecosystems. “Ethereum is a smart contract platform… It’s really the rails where I think a lot of things are going to be built,” he said. “Stablecoins… prediction markets… and now talk about tokenizing more than just dollars, but equities, real estate, and alternative assets… these are all rising.” To Lee, those data points reinforce the thesis that it is a story that is still in the earliest stages and one of the reasons why BitMine considers it a super cycle. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan echoed that view, calling the current environment a rare entry point. “I think regardless of what happens on the economy in the next year, stable coins will grow tremendously… tokenization will maybe 10x in the next few years… prediction markets are going to be huge… decentralized identity and digital identity are going to be huge,” he said. For investors looking long-term, he added, “it really is almost a gift.” One open question remains whether Bitcoin has already peaked for the cycle. Lee said the answer will shape how investors interpret the next year. “If Bitcoin makes a new high this year, then it really obviates the fact that there is a four-year cycle.” He expects broader market strength to carry into year-end, helping push Bitcoin back to all-time highs. In other words, the pain may be real, but the cycle is far from over.

Title: Fidelity launching Solana ETF as analysts eye $160 price before December

About us Copy link Solana’s exchange-traded fund season is in full swing and analysts are bullish that it can trigger a rally for the sixth biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The prediction comes as Fidelity, the $7 trillion asset manager, is set to launch its spot Solana ETF under ticker FSOL on Tuesday, marking one of the top institutional endorsements in altcoins, analysts say. The vote of confidence in Solana, combined with the general crypto market recovering from its current $1.2 trillion sell-off, could catapult the price by up to 16% this month, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget. “We could see a recovery toward the $156–$160 range by late November, especially as its ecosystem continues expanding in DeFi, consumer apps, and memecoin volume,” Lee told DL News. Solana’s price is down 27% over the past month to trade at $137. Fidelity’s spot Solana ETF launch lands at a pivotal time for digital assets on Wall Street. Financial giants have muscled into the crypto like never before in 2025, incentivised by the light-touch regulations promised by the White House. The third biggest investment manager in the world swooping in to launch a spot Solana ETF underscores the dramatic shift from how Wall Street used to shun the industry in the past. “Welcome to the future,” Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, said on X. The launch also comes as US regulatory agencies are reopening after a record 43-day shutdown that froze key decisions, and ETF issuers are rushing back into the pipeline. It’s not just Fidelity jumping on Solana. Canary Capital is also scheduled to launch its SOLC fund in partnership with Marinade Finance, adding Solana’s staking capabilities straight out of the gate. Last week, Canary’s XRP ETF stunned even veteran market watchers with nearly $250 million in first-day inflows, setting a new record for 2025. And now Solana is stepping into the same slipstream, analysts say. “For the first time, institutional investors are being invited to consider Solana as a standalone macro asset,” Maria Carola, CEO of crypto exchange StealthEx, told DL News. “This represents a significant shift in perception.” “Every bullish cycle needs a new protagonist, and today, Solana looks like the most likely contender,” Carola said. Fidelity launching a Solana ETF also highlights the absence of one of the key players in previous crypto ETF launches: BlackRock. While the $12.5 trillion asset manager dominates the US Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF market, it has so far not made any public moves to launch a spot Solana ETF. And that’s potentially an opportunity for Fidelity, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said. “Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” Balchunas said on X. “[Bitwise] got out first, has $450m, [VanEck] launched today, Grayscale is in [the] mix. Game on.” Grayscale executive Zach Pandl told DL News in October that Solana ETFs could see $5 billion in investment. To be sure, previous Solana ETF releases have not been blockbuster hits. In October, Grayscale’s GSOL saw just $4 million in inflows on its first day while Bitwise’s BSOL fared better, at $129 million. Like Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, GSOL began as a trust, meaning it was initially a closed investment vehicle. Grayscale converted the trust into an ETF structure in October, which enables investors to trade it easily. Solana is trading at $137 at time of reporting, down over 50% from its all time high set in January 2025 during the memecoin peak. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Fidelity, Canary ignite Solana’s ETF race – So why is retail pulling back?

Could this be the perfect setup for the next bull run? With the launch of FSOL and SOLC, there will be five active spot Solana ETFs in the market. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the news and called it a major milestone for Solana. The race to dominate the Solana [SOL] ETF market is heating up once again. This time, it’s Fidelity and Canary Capital stepping into the spotlight with the upcoming launch of the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) and Canary Marinade Solana ETF (SOLC), both set to debut on the 18th of November. Once these funds go live, the crypto market will boast five active Spot Solana ETFs. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the launch as another milestone moment in Solana’s rapid ascent within the regulated investment landscape. Taking to X, Balchunas noted, “Fidelity recently rolled out *direct* spot solana trading…Tomorrow they’ll launch spot sol ETF.So both direct sol access & spot ETFs. World’s *third* largest asset manager. Welcome to the future.” However, he also expressed his disappointment and mentioned, “Still surprised BlackRock is sitting this one out.” While anticipation had been building that BlackRock might join the Solana ETF wave, the firm seemed content sticking to its established Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] offerings. In fact, in a recent interview, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, dismissed the broader altcoin market, bluntly stating that “most of the altcoins are worthless.” He said, “One has to be very wary going far down the table with hundreds of thousands of crypto assets today. The vast majority of those are or will be totally worthless.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart also confirmed the Canary ETF listing, adding that issuers were competing aggressively for Solana dominance. Source: James Seyffart/X Yet, despite the wave of ETF launches and institutional excitement, SOL market performance told a different story. At press time, the token was trading at $136.80, down 3.24% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting fading market enthusiasm. This showed that investor sentiment around the altcoin has cooled sharply. Data from Polymarket showed that traders assigned just 7% probability of SOL reaching a new all-time high before 2026, a steep fall from 60% odds in September at the height of ETF optimism. This downturn coincided with the debut of VanEck’s Solana ETF (VSOL) on the 17th of November, which officially began trading on Nasdaq after receiving regulatory clearance under the SEC’s updated ETF framework. Farside Investors data showed Solana ETF recording $8.2 million inflows at the same time, with Bitwise’s BSOL recording $7.3 million inflows and Grayscale’s GSOL recording $0.9 million inflows.

Title: BlackRock Sidesteps the Solana ETF Showdown — Is It a Miss or Masterplan?

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Fidelity’s Solana ETF, launching on November 19, 2025, with a 25-basis-point fee, marks the entry of traditional asset managers into the Solana ETF market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is notably not participating in this competition. As major financial institutions move swiftly to capture market share in the growing Solana ETF sector, BlackRock’s decision to focus solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum products raises questions about the future of altcoin-based funds. The Solana ETF market is expanding quickly as several firms announce new products. Bitwise’s BSOL debuted with around $450 million in assets, while VanEck’s VSOL launched on November 18, 2025. Fidelity’s FSOL, set for release on November 19, is a milestone as it brings the largest traditional asset manager into this growing sector. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the competition, noting Fidelity’s position as the largest asset manager in the Solana ETF category. The 25 basis point fee positions FSOL to compete closely with other leading products as firms strive for market leadership in this new area. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe Canary Capital is also entering the field with its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, which features on-chain staking through a partnership with Marinade Finance. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg According to Nasdaq’s official listing announcement, the Canary Marinade Solana ETF began trading on November 18, 2025. Grayscale has added further competition in this forming segment. Solana’s market activity demonstrates the growing attention. Open interest in SOL futures is rising as November 19 approaches, indicating increased trader participation and engagement. This recent activity signals rising institutional interest in Solana exposure, even as the price consolidates. Meanwhile, BlackRock has made its position clear, to concentrate exclusively on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, not expanding into altcoins. Robert Mitchnick, the firm’s digital assets head, expressed at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville that assets beyond BTC and ETH lack the maturity, liquidity, and market capitalization necessary for ETF products. According to BlackRock’s leadership, the next-largest cryptocurrency after Ethereum accounts for approximately 3% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, which is well below the firm’s product launch thresholds. “I don’t think we’re going to see a long list of crypto ETFs. If you think of Bitcoin, today it represents about 55% of the market cap. Ethereum is at 18%. The next plausible investible asset is at, like, 3%. It’s just not close to being at that threshold or track record of maturity, liquidity, etc.,” Mitchnick said. Jay Jacobs and Robert Mitchnick have stressed that only a minority of BlackRock’s clients currently own IBIT or ETHA, hence their pivot. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has delivered strong results since its January 2024 debut. Similarly, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, ETHA, reached over $1 billion in assets under management within two months of launch. However, the financial instruments have been recording outflows over the past few weeks, which could move the firm to consider joining the Solana ETF frenzy. Meanwhile, analysts have dissected theories that TradFi players like BlackRock foraying into the Bitcoin ETF market is a demonstration of bullishness. According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, their move is a calculated basis trade, with this hidden institutional strategy now distorting ETF inflows.

Title: Record $1.26B Outflow Hits BlackRock Bitcoin ETF as Bearish Options Cost Soars
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/18/record-usd1-26b-outflow-hits-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-as-bearish-options-cost-soars

Full Content:
BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has registered record outflows this month amid a price slide and a sharp rise in the cost of bearish options used to hedge against further market declines. The Nasdaq-listed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has recorded a net outflow of $1.26 billion so far this month, marking the largest monthly redemption since its launch in January 2024, according to data from SoSoValue. This outflow is part of a broader trend affecting the market, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experiencing withdrawals totaling $2.59 billion. IBIT's price has collapsed 16% to $52, the level last seen on April 22, data from TradingView show. The price crash has traders aggressively chasing put options as a form of protection against further declines. This is reflected in the 250-day put-call skew tracked by MarketChameleon, which measures the relative cost of puts compared to calls. The 250-day put-call skew has surged to a seven-month high of 3.1%, indicating that put options, used to hedge downside risks, are currently at their most expensive relative to calls since April.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $2.6B – Why Arthur Hayes says ‘investors don’t like BTC’
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-2-6b-why-arthur-hayes-says-investors-dont-like-btc/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T09:00:58Z

Hayes dumped his atltcoin bags for ZEC amid the ongoing weakness. Per Hayes, hedge funds are liquidating their BTC positions as the basis trade declines. According to him, an improvement in the liquidity conditions in early December could juice risk assets and drive BTC to $200k. Bitcoin’s [BTC] institutional flows have remained negative for the fourth week in a row, further accelerating the ongoing sell-off. So far in November, $2.59 billion has left the U.S. spot BTC ETFs, with half of the outflows ($1.26 billion) driven by BlackRock’s IBIT investors. Source: SoSo Value According to Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, the BlackRock bleed-out was primarily from hedge funds, such as Goldman Sachs, which have been seeking extra yield above Fed rates via BTC basis trade. It involves buying spot BTC ETFs and shorting on the asset on CME to capture the spread (basis trade). However, now that the basis trade is no longer attractive, they have hedge funds with spot BTC ETFs that have exited their positions, noted Hayes. Source: Glassnode Since October, the yield has shrunk from about 14% to below 5%. And with it, the hedge fund-led ETF outflows intensified, further spooking retail investors, added Hayes. “Now retail believes these same investors don’t like Bitcoin and creates a negative feedback loop that influences them to sell, which decreases the basis, finally causing more institutional investors to sell the ETF.” Additionally, the demand from BTC treasuries has also faded, further reinforcing the short-term concern that major players are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hayes highlighted that the dollar liquidity has also been withdrawn and could be re-injected by December when the Fed ends Quantitative Tightening (QT). Source: Bloomberg/Arthur Hayes (Treasury General Account, TGA balance) The Treasury General Balance (TGA) is the U.S government’s primary operating account and directly affects market liquidity. A TGA balance increase leads to liquidity drains as the Treasury collects more money from the market, while a decrease boosts liquidity. According to the chart shared by Hayes, there was an uptick in TGA in late October that further deepened the market rout, particularly for risk assets. Hayes projected that BTC could slip toward $80k–$85k in the short term before surging toward $200k by year-end, contingent on liquidity easing. In the meantime, Hayes expected the privacy narrative, led by Zcash [ZEC], to remain strong despite broader weakening. In fact, he dumped most of the altcoins for ZEC.

Good luck getting a seat on weekend mornings at this ever popular Westport, Co Mayo cafe and shop. All-day brunch dishes come with unlimited pour-over coffee at this award-winning Kilkenny bakery and cafe. It might be tiny, but this unique Dublin 2 spot is pound for pound an all-out champion. There’s no doubt about it: the Wednesday-Friday lunchtime menu at Coppinger is the smartest money in Dublin city centre. Even a fire can’t stop this Cork powerhouse, which is now serving a shorter Bites menu while repairs are carried out. Dubliners and wine lovers in the know all nod sagely when Fish Shop is mentioned. We don’t gatekeep here. There’s nothing quite like the cheeky feeling of delicious food eaten among groaning shelves of wine in Terenure, Dublin 6W. Good luck to you if you can secure a booking at this Ranelagh spot, but if you do, you’re in for some of the best small plates, pasta and grilled meats in Dublin. Maggie Roche’s daytime cafe in Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, is the business. And it even has a dedicated menu section for Coolattin cheddar. Over 30 years old, Cork’s Paradiso still leads the way for vegetarian cooking and natural wines. A Dublin institution celebrating 15 years in business in Powerscourt Town Centre; the pear and bacon sandwich is an icon. Warm hospitality from Milli, and deliciously spiced dishes from Santhosh, all tucked away in Blackrock Market in Dublin. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
