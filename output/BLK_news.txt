ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Vanguard and Fidelity offer popular index funds with competitive expense ratios. Is one fund family better for your investment portfolio than the other? This detailed comparison of Vanguard and Fidelity index funds—covering fees, performance and selection—helps you decide. One fun fact sums up Vanguard’s investment philosophy: Under the direction of company founder John Bogle, Vanguard created the world's first index fund in 1976. Bogle's innovation gave investors convenient access to a low-cost portfolio that could be held for decades. Bogle also decided to market Vanguard funds directly to investors, bypassing brokers, and to eliminate sales loads. Both moves, unconventional in the 1970s, showed Vanguard's commitment to the individual investor's success. The move to drop sales charges has spared investors from hundreds of millions in fees over the past several decades. Today, Vanguard retains its reputation as a leader in low-cost funds and a champion of retail investors. According to Morningstar, Fidelity is the third-largest fund family after Vanguard and BlackRock in terms of U.S. market concentration. The company was formed to take over the Fidelity Fund in 1946 and launched its first index fund in 1988. Fidelity's index fund strategy emphasizes low costs and fund performance that aligns closely to the target index. Both objectives benefit index fund investors by minimizing dilution of underlying investment returns. Below are head-to-head comparisons for Vanguard and Fidelity on expense ratios, fund selection, fund performance and minimum investment requirements. Vanguard expense ratios on index funds with investment minimums of $3,000 or less range from 0.03% to 0.2%. Per author calculations, the average expense ratio is 0.07%, which equates to $7 annually for every $10,000 invested. Fidelity expense ratios across 82 index funds for retail investors range from 0% to 0.4%. The average is 0.12%, per author calculations. This translates to $12 annually per $10,000 invested. Vanguard has the lower average expense ratio, but Fidelity offers a selection of zero-expense funds. Also, Fidelity’s S&P 500 fund, FXAIX, has lower expenses than Vanguard's S&P 500 portfolios. FXIAX charges 0.015%, while Vanguard's VOO ETF and VFAIX fund charge 0.03% and 0.04%, respectively. Both companies beat broader expense ratio averages. A Morningstar report concludes that the average fees for passively managed funds in 2023 was 0.55%. Vanguard has more index funds with low investment minimums than Fidelity, but both families cover these popular market segments: Cryptocurrency is one point of differentiation and Fidelity has the edge. Fidelity has funds stocked with bitcoin (FBTC) and ethereum (FETH). Vanguard does not offer crypto funds. Performance comparisons for index funds can be tricky because the underlying index is primarily responsible for defining the portfolio. So, the comparison is most telling when two funds are targeting the same index. In that case, sampling methods and trading efficiency can introduce a higher-than-necessary tracking error—causing one fund to underperform. The table below compares returns for S&P 500 funds and U.S. bond market funds from both families. Fidelity performed slightly better on the S&P 500 fund and in the one-year period for the bond fund. Lower expense ratios on the two Fidelity mutual funds contribute to the outperformance. More generalized comparisons can be made between funds that offer similar exposures but rely on different target indexes. The index gets most of the credit for outperformance, particularly when both compared funds have low tracking errors. Even so, the fund family can take responsibility for choosing the stronger index. This table compares Vanguard and Fidelity funds with similar strategies, implemented through different target indexes. You can see the performance gaps are larger vs. the prior comparison. The Vanguard index funds mostly outperformed here, despite Fidelity’s funds having lower expense ratios. Both Vanguard and Fidelity have at least 80 index funds with a $0 or $1 investment minimum. These are predominantly exchange-traded funds. Vanguard additionally has about 50 mutual funds with a $3,000 minimum investment. Both Vanguard and Fidelity are appropriate for beginner investors. Those who plan to own only an S&P 500 fund and a bond fund might earn slightly higher returns with Fidelity, thanks to the ultra-low expense ratios. On the other hand, Vanguard’s website and fund research tools are somewhat easier to navigate than Fidelity's. Fortunately, choosing one fund family doesn't mean you give up access to the other. If you are trading in a Vanguard brokerage account, you may pay extra fees to buy Fidelity mutual funds and vice versa. You can avoid the fees by purchasing ETFs instead or by opening a new account with the other fund family. Morningstar is a leading researcher of mutual funds and fund families. The company's Fund Family Digest summarizes research and ratings on the 150 largest fund families in the U.S. According to the 2024 Fund Family Digest, Vanguard is the largest fund family with $8.5 trillion in U.S. assets under management (AUM). Fidelity is ranked third with $2.95 trillion in AUM. Vanguard also has the highest Parent Rating by Morningstar Manager Research analysts. Only 10 fund families earn this rating, based on manager tenure, risk management, performance, fees and other factors. Additionally, 99% of Vanguard’s assets are in share classes with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Morningstar analysts assign these ratings to funds that are expected to outperform their category index after fees. Fidelity's parent rating is Above Average and 95% of its assets are in funds with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Vanguard and Fidelity have sufficient index fund options to fulfill simple or complex investing strategies. Fidelity does have cryptocurrency funds, which may be an advantage if bitcoin or ethereum exposure is part of your allocation plan. Vanguard has more assets under management and slightly higher Morningstar ratings, implying a more stable fund management team and better performance potential. Bottom Line You can implement many passive investment portfolios with Vanguard or Fidelity. To choose the right family, review Vanguard.com and Fidelity.com. See if one brand speaks to you over the other. If not, identify which exposures you'll invest in first, such as the S&P 500 or all U.S. stocks. Compare your options across the two families and select the one with lower tracking errors. That hopefully keeps much of the underlying investment returns flowing into your net worth.

Title: Mumbai Airport Operator Secures $1 Billion Financing for Upgrades

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, India Chhatrapati Shivaji Internatonal Airport, Mumbai, India / David Wong Adani landing two big funding deals back-to-back says a lot about how easily the group can tap into global money. And it’s happening just as India’s trying to catch up on airport infrastructure. Select a question above or ask something else Indian airport operator Adani Airport Holdings has raised $1 billion to support the growth and improvement of Mumbai International Airport. The funding comes just weeks after the airport company secured $750 million from a group of global banks to upgrade six other airports across India. Adani Airport Holdings manages seven Indian airports and is the country's largest airport infrastructure company, accounting for 25% of passenger footfalls and 33% of the country’s air cargo traffic. The $1 billion is a mix of a $750 million bond sale and the option to raise another $250 million later. The funds will go toward “transforming the airports infrastructure through continued investments in modernization, capacity expansion, digitization, and technology integration,” Adani said in a statement. It added that the investment will also support sustainability goals, including a target for Mumbai Airport to hit net-zero emissions by 2029. This is the first time a private company in India’s airport sector has raised money through an investment-grade bond. Adani Airport said it expects the bond to receive a BBB- rating, which is a medium-grade score. Adani Airport raised the money using a structure called “project finance,” which ties the loan directly to Mumbai Airport’s income rather than backing it with the broader Adani Group. Apollo, a US-based investment firm, led the deal, with other participants including BlackRock and Standard Chartered. Calling it the “largest private investment-grade project finance issuances,” Arun Bansal, CEO, Adani Airport, said: “With participation from Apollo-managed funds and leading institutional investors, we are proud to deepen our access to global pools of capital.” This new round of funding follows a $750 million loan Adani Airport took earlier this month from a consortium of international banks, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Barclays, and Standard Chartered. The company said the loan would support upgrades at six regional airports: Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati, and Thiruvananthapuram. Adani Airport had said it would also use the money to grow non-aviation services like retail, food and beverage, and duty-free shopping inside airports, all of which are becoming big revenue sources for airport operators. Last year, reports quoting Jugeshinder Singh, the group's chief financial officer, said Adani Enterprises is planning to list Adani Airport Holdings by fiscal 2028. Together, these two fundraising deals suggest Adani Airport is pushing ahead with its plan to modernize and expand capacity across its network. The company served 94 million passengers in the last financial year and aims to handle 300 million annually by 2040. The upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, also managed by Adani, is being developed for $2 billion and is expected to ease congestion at the current Mumbai airport. The aim is to position the city as a global transit hub. The airport's opening has now been pushed from May this year to August. The first phase will add capacity for 20 million passengers, with eventual expansion up to 90 million. Airlines like IndiGo have already committed to flying from the new airport as soon as it opens. Low-cost carrier Akasa Air became the latest airline to partner with Adani Airport to commence flight operations. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said earlier this month that the Navi Mumbai airport will connect to 14 international destinations at launch. India is now the world’s third-largest aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). India’s 174 million passengers in 2024 accounted for 4.2% of global air traffic. IATA projects India’s annual passenger traffic to triple by 2044, reaching 425 million journeys per year. The airports in Mumbai, along with the upcoming Jewar airport in Delhi, will help cater to the growing demand for air travel in the country.

Title: The best new restaurants and cafes to open in Ireland in the past year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/06/24/the-best-new-restaurants-and-cafes-to-try-this-year/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s all change in Barna where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a brand new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes – but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue, and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay, and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consomé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Vatican backs report calling for financial reforms to alleviate global debt crisis
URL: https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/264943/vatican-backs-report-calling-for-financial-reforms-to-alleviate-global-external-debt
Time Published: 2025-06-23T19:15:00Z
Full Content:
By Victoria Cardiel Vatican City, Jun 23, 2025 / 15:15 pm The Vatican has endorsed a report calling for reforms to alleviate the global debt crisis affecting billions of people in developing countries. The document, titled “The Jubilee Report: A Blueprint for Tackling the Debt and Development Crises and Creating the Financial Foundations for a Sustainable People-Centered Global Economy,” was presented at the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences on June 20 as one of the main initiatives of the 2025 Jubilee Year of Hope. Supported by Pope Leo XIV, the publication is the work of the Jubilee Commission created by Pope Francis in June 2024 in order to find a way to carry out sovereign debt restructuring based on ethical principles. Thirty international economic experts were on the commission, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former Argentine Economy Minister Martín Guzmán. According to data maintained by the U.N., global public debt reached $97 trillion in 2023, an increase of $5.6 trillion compared with 2022. The document reports that more than 50 developing countries already allocate more than 10% of their tax revenues to interest payments, a dynamic that diverts financial resources from vital sectors such as health, education, and climate resilience (the capacity to respond to climate change or extreme weather events.) “The debt crisis that is suffocating the global financial system is also fueling a development crisis,” the report states. It proposes a series of measures and recommendations to transform the international financial system into an instrument of justice and sustainability. These include the creation of an international bankruptcy mechanism for sovereign countries similar to those that exist for private companies; an end to government bailouts for private investors; and the provision of bridge loans and short-term financial support for countries in crisis. The initiative is part of the spirit of the jubilee year, traditionally associated with mercy and debt forgiveness. In fact, in the 2024 papal bull Spes Non Confundit, Pope Francis expressly asked governments to show clemency by extraordinary measures, such as forgiving the external (foreign) debt of poor countries. The June 20 report recaptures the spirit of the Jubilee of the Year 2000, when in 1997, St. John Paul II initiated a truly global movement based on the Church’s social teaching that called for debt relief for the poorest countries. That call gave rise to the “Jubilee 2000” campaign, which collected millions of signatures around the world and mobilized religious communities of all traditions. Thanks to this movement, more than $100 billion in debt was canceled. “Global finance must serve people and the planet — not punish the poorest to protect profits,” the report concludes. The report was presented June 20 at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences during a day dedicated to discussions about how reforms to international financial systems could move toward a truly people-centered system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Stiglitz, professor at Columbia University and honorary fellow of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, issued a forceful call to “curb the abuses of large private creditors.” “Normally, we talk about shared responsibility between creditors and debtors, but I would say there is greater responsibility on the part of creditors. These are voluntary transactions. No one has forced creditors to lend money, and they are supposed to be the experts in risk analysis,” he stated in his remarks. (Story continues below) The economist was particularly critical of BlackRock and other large funds, which, he said, encourage a type of high-risk lending that ends in crises. He therefore advocated strengthening the role of multilateral development banks, which can provide loans at lower rates, something that “would help reduce interest rates and make debt sustainable.” Within the framework of the international meeting on debt, social justice, and development held at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences headquarters, Caritas International representative Alfonso Apicella urged that the technical debate on debt never lose sight of the people most affected. “We’re here to talk about sustainable growth, but the real question is: sustainable growth for whom? That’s the question we’re asked time and again by communities when we launch campaigns like ‘Turn Debt Into Hope,’” he explained. Speaking on behalf of the global network of 162 organizations that make up Caritas, Apicella emphasized that the discourse on “sustainability” runs the risk of becoming an empty slogan if its inclusive focus isn’t made explicit: “We have to talk about sustainable growth for all, not just a few. And we must always remember this, especially when we speak from a technical perspective, because behind every figure there are people who experience these realities firsthand.” Apicella also focused on the need to change the narrative on debt: “We must frame this fight for debt justice as a win-win situation. If we work for the poor, policymakers must understand that they will also benefit.” Professor Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, pointed to international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund that have forced poor countries to “prematurely open their capital accounts.” However, he also acknowledged the internal responsibility of many developing countries that, as the report notes, “have borrowed too much and invested too little.” In any case, he made it clear that while “debt relief is essential,” it is also necessary to propose viable implementation measures within the current international environment that transform the financial system. “We have already learned from the last jubilee debt forgiveness in 2009 that debt relief without reforms to the international financial architecture will only lead us to repeat this whole process. It’s a shame that we are in this situation again. Let us not repeat the same mistakes,” Gallagher said. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

In his first Angelus address of 2025, Pope Francis called for debt relief for the world’s poorest nations and renewed his appeals for peace. The papal bull declares that the Jubilee will officially begin with the opening of the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica on Christmas Eve 2024. CNA is a service of EWTN News, Inc.

A FORMER SCHOOL principal convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30-year period has been jailed for four years for some of the offences, with further sentencing to follow for the others. Aidan Clohessy (85) was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. Imposing sentence in the first case against him today, Judge Elva Duffy said Clohessy was “living a life full of good deeds during the day” but was also “an ogre” who carried out “what can only be described as atrocities at night time, when no one could see that behaviour”. Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co. Dublin from the 1970s until 1993. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disabilities at that time. The boys were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin, was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. Today, he was sentenced four years in relation to the offending against these two boys. Judge Duffy noted Clohessy’s age and health would make custody more challenging for him. The jury in the second trial returned guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault – two for one boy, and one count each in relation to three other boys. All this offending took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. Having heard evidence in this case today, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence. Victim impact statements were read to the court on behalf of all six injured parties. They outlined how the abuse affected their mental health, relationships, education and later employment opportunities. One man said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day, you will be handed your judgement.” Another said he struggled to learn his wedding vows or to read his children a story. Clohessy was interviewed voluntarily by gardaí and denied wrongdoing. He acknowledged that corporal punishment was used in the school, including by him. Clohessy told gardaí this included striking boys on their bare buttocks, but said this was only for the most serious offences and only of those boys who were residents at the school. The investigating gardai agreed with Ronan Kennedy SC, defending, that his client was co-operative during the investigation. The garda further agreed that Clohessy has been the subject of adverse media publicity. Kennedy told the court his client will not be appealing the jury’s decision in either trial. Clohessy is originally from Co. Limerick and entered the religious order after completing his Leaving Certificate in 1958. He initially trained as a psychiatric nurse and after some years working in this area, retrained as a teacher. Clohessy started work at St Augustine’s School in 1969, becoming principal in the mid 1970s. Kennedy said his client served in roles on the provisional leadership team and was appointed in 1993 to lead a mission in Malawi to develop mental health services there, where he remained until 2013 when he returned to Ireland. Kennedy said Clohessy lives “a humble and quiet existence” and supports other members of the religious community who have significant health issues. A medical report and two testimonials were handed to the court on Clohessy’s behalf. Kennedy asked the court to take into account his client will find custody more difficult due to his age and health issues. He submitted that his client would have to live with the stigma of being a sex offender and has already been subject to negative publicity. “In many respects, he was already condemned and judged in the court of public opinion before he was ever tried in this court,” Kennedy said. An investigating garda outlined the evidence of the first trial to the court. The first boy was aged around 10 when he went to St Augustine’s School in 1973. Advertisement In the first incident, the boy, who was a boarder, had returned to the chalet and was making a sandwich when he heard the front door open. He knew it was Clohessy. Clohessy called the boy “demon” and said he had to get the demon out of him. The boy was taken to a room, where Clohessy slapped him on his bare buttocks and touched his testicles. The court heard there were other similar incidents including occasions when the boy felt something wet on the small of his back. On one occasion, the boy felt something in his buttocks, didn’t know what it was, but knew Clohessy had done it. The court heard there is no suggestion that this was an object. The abuse ended when the boy was around 11 or 12. A victim impact statement was read to the court by the injured party’s wife. He said the pain “imposed on me as a child has never truly gone away” and has “shaped every part of what I became”. He developed trust issues and has had feelings of shame, confusion and fear. He said the trial brought a lot of that fear and trauma back to the surface. “It was like being haunted by the ghost of your own life,” he said. The man said the abuse took away his childhood and “stole my future” as he could not learn like other children and left school with limited literacy skills. He said he struggled to find work to support his family, and they had experienced financial pressures. Addressing Clohessy directly, he said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day you will be handed your judgement.” A second boy, who was also a boarder at the school, was around 11 when the first incident took place. He was in a changing area after he had taken part in a swimming race when Clohessy came in. Clohessy told the boy, “I told you to win the next time” and touched the boy, who was getting changed, in his genital area. In a separate incident on the same day, Clohessy called the boy over while walking past the chalets and touched him inappropriately. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion. The boy was in Clohessy’s office on another occasion when the principal told the boy to take down his clothing. The boy refused to remove his underwear and Clohessy pulled it down. The boy felt something hard on his buttocks, then something wet. The boy dried himself off and asked Clohessy why, but didn’t get an answer. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and said something like “son, no one knows”. The court also heard evidence about another incident in a storage area of the gym building where Clohessy touched the boy inappropriately. Clohessy said to him: “Son, I hope no one knows.” In a victim impact statement he said the abuse impacted his education, his mental health and his later employment. Imposing sentence, Judge Duffy said the age of the injured parties and that the offending took place on multiple occasions, were aggravating features. The judge noted the contents of both victim impact statements. She said these were “vulnerable children” who had been entrusted to Clohessy’s care. Judge Duffy noted the defence had indicated there would be no appeal and she expressed the court’s hope that this might offer some peace for the two injured parties in moving forward. The judge said she had read the testimonials and acknowledged that while Clohessy has “good elements”, this offending took place “in total secrecy”. She said she would impose two separate sentences of two years, to run consecutively. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Projects Disruptive Global Dominance for Ethereum layer-1 (L1)

Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has taken to X to share his outlook on the future of the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain, which he believes is primed for global dominance. Lubin’s assertions are in response to the recently approved Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to clarify the use of stablecoins. The Ethereum co-founder can be seen on X, affirming the sentiments of an Ethereum supporter, who referenced Pro-Ethereum sentiments shared by Robbie Mitchnick, the head of Digital Assets at BlackRock. The BlackRock official, who appears to be bullish on Ethereum, previously revealed that Ethereum ranks as the first choice on the company’s radar, particularly when the investment firm begins to explore tokenization. On the other hand, Lubin highlighted some of the blockchain’s key features, including its permissionless nature and flexible structure, neutral state, and anti-censorship design, adding that the Ethereum blockchain is primed to continue on a decentralized path. “Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the world; Permissionless to inspect, use, and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral [and] censorship resistant. Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing itself.” He wrote. Lubin stressed the role of the Ethereum community in strengthening the blockchain, hailing community members from developers to users, and applauding their commitment to the network’s core values. However, he maintains that network regulation is bound to become increasingly difficult as barriers are underway. “With a best-in-class giant community that is constantly hyper vigilant as there will always be patient, well resourcedactors working to subvert the system. Fortunately this will get harder and harder as Ethereum grows and matures.” He asserts.

Title: Is the $313 Million Ether Transfer to Coinbase Signaling Major Sell-Off?

A large Ethereum (ETH) transfer has sparked renewed fears of a potential market dump, just as leverage in the ETH futures market surges to record levels. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain flagged a massive transaction of 113,000 ETH—valued at approximately $313 million—deposited into crypto exchange Coinbase. The move was initiated from a single whale wallet amid heightened speculative trading activity and rising institutional accumulation of ETH. Whale deposits to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as a signal that large holders may be preparing to sell. Lookonchain reported the transaction on X, noting that the wallet had remained dormant for a considerable period before suddenly moving its entire holdings to Coinbase. While the motive behind the transfer remains unknown, such high-value movements often precede large sell orders, especially when combined with current market conditions. The timing of the whale deposit aligns with a new all-time high in Ethereum futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, ETH futures open interest has surpassed $29 billion, driven by increasing speculative activity using stablecoin-backed, cash-margined contracts. This trend is also reflected in the growing presence of retail traders in Ethereum’s derivatives market. CryptoQuant reported that futures trading frequency among smaller investors has spiked above its 12-month average, contrasting with Bitcoin’s stagnant on-chain activity. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, institutional demand for ETH has remained steady. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly acquired $163.6 million in ETH across two consecutive weeks, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,295, marking a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours. Analysts have identified $2,800 as a critical resistance level. According to crypto traders such as Daan Crypto Trades and Duo Nine, a break above this threshold could lead to a push toward the $3,000 mark. However, with leverage peaking and large ETH volumes moving to exchanges, the market remains on alert for a possible correction. High open interest and excessive retail positioning have historically led to liquidations during sudden price swings. In contrast to bullish sentiment, some traders are beginning to open short positions on ETH. Lookonchain highlighted this divergence, suggesting that some market participants prepare for a downside move in response to the whale transfer and overheated derivatives activity. While Ethereum continues to enjoy institutional inflows and speculative momentum, the $313 million whale transfer to Coinbase has introduced a new layer of uncertainty.

The US Has Bombed Iran: Cast Aside Illusions. Phil Taylor, Robin Philpot By Phil Taylor and Robin Philpot, June 23, 2025 Within days, perhaps hours, we may expect the White House to announce meetings with a willing coalition of Iranian political expats who will be described as a government in exile. The bombing will continue. Obama described the bombing and sanctions strategy as “degrading” the targeted country’s ability to resist. “Bleeding” would be another word. The West’s Reckless Militarization and the New International Order By Stephen Sefton, June 23, 2025 From the perspective of the North American and European elites, the developing new world order threatens their customary political-military dominance and their subsequent neocolonial economic control based on centuries of ruthless imperialist aggression. The Consolidation of US-Israeli Hegemony Lies at the Heart of the Attack on Iran – Not Iran’s Alleged Nuclear Programme By Adeyinka Makinde, June 23, 2025 The attack by the State of Israel on Iran on Friday, June 13th, has been narrated as one that is based on the threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. But a closer examination reveals the nuclear issue to be a pretext for a regime change operation designed both to secure Israel’s military domination of West Asia and to maintain U.S. global hegemony. Iran Is the Sixth Country on the List of the Countries America Is to Destroy for Israel. Dr. Paul C. Roberts By Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, June 23, 2025 Wars are everywhere, but no government acknowledges the fact by declaring war. Putin doesn’t even consider the West’s attack on Russia’s strategic forces an act of war. When we find leaders fleeing Reality, we should understand that we are in trouble. Trump Takes America to War. “Troublesome Backstory” … Without Any Declaration of War. Dr. Philip Giraldi By Philip Giraldi, June 23, 2025 Trump’s first five months in office have demonstrated that he has a deplorable disregard for the Constitution of the United States, preferring to believe that his self-declared executive authority as president overrides the constitutional prerogatives of both the judiciary and the legislature. Digital Harvest — BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street: Shareholders in the Shadows. Colin Todhunter By Colin Todhunter, June 23, 2025 They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. The US, Great Britain and France at War with Israel against Iran By Manlio Dinucci, June 23, 2025 Trump presented himself as a “mediator” between Israel and Iran. He officially reiterated that “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” He also demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender.“ Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Title: What The GENIUS Act Could Mean For The Digital Dollar
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/23/what-the-genius-act-could-mean-for-the-digital-dollar/

BySandy Peng BySandy Peng, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images) The Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, aiming to bring stablecoins under a national regulatory framework. In this historic bill, which now needs to pass the House of Representatives, lawmakers are moving to define what a “digital dollar” really is. The stablecoin market expanded from $5 billion in 2020 to nearly $261 billion today, with Tether alone holding $155 billion. For context, Tether’s $155 billion market cap rivals the GDP of Hungary, which was about $212 billion in 2023. Last year, the company reported $13 billion in profits from investing its reserves, primarily in the U.S. Treasuries, making it more profitable than BlackRock. In fact, according to a report by the crypto exchange CEX.io, more money moved through stablecoins than Mastercard in 2024. Over $27.6 trillion was settled via tokens most mainstream credit card users still haven’t heard of, or understand, quite yet. Until now, the most rapid growth of stablecoin usage has taken place outside of North America, even though most stablecoins are pegged in some way to the dollar. In Latin America, 71% of financial services firms now use stablecoins for cross-border payments. The region processes $94.2 billion in genuine payment settlements, not trading volume. Business-to-business payments alone account for $3 billion per month. The acceleration gained momentum after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s April 2025 guidance declared that traditional 1:1 backed stablecoins aren’t securities. Within weeks, Société Générale announced USDCV, backed by Bank of New York Mellon. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands for Hong Kong's first licensed stablecoin. And all in all, one thing is clear: stablecoins have found their product market fit. Fit for emerging economies, where people don’t want to lose ~6.65% to remittances. Fit for better yield than what standard banks are providing. Fit for everyone who doesn’t want to wait for their payments to settle in three days. By the end of 2025, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of stablecoins launching. Yet they won’t take on the typical form as we commonly know it — instead, stablecoins will be getting more and more complicated. This explosion in usage is precisely what the GENIUS Act aims to address: how do you regulate a financial instrument that already moves more money than global card networks? Today’s stablecoin landscape ranges from fiat-backed tokens like USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), to algorithmic models, to complex financial instruments that generate yield or track exotic assets. In February, Figure Markets launched YLDS, the first SEC-registered yield-bearing stablecoin, offering 3.85% APY tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate rates. MakerDAO’s new USDS accepts everything from Ethereum to tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are simple, static, and centrally issued. But the next thousand stablecoins won’t look like these stablecoins at all. They'll be yield-generating machines wrapped in “dollar clothing” — commodity plays disguised as cash or real estate exposure that fits inside your digital wallet. We’ll soon be able to use stablecoins that automatically shift between treasury bills and corporate bonds based on market conditions, or tokens that give you exposure to African farmland while maintaining a dollar peg. We’re already beginning to see certain hints: tokenized gold reserves, carbon credit backing and even stablecoin protocols that track baskets of emerging market currencies. Projects like Virtual Finance, who are building on Scroll — a blockchain that I co-founded, and Synthetix, are experimenting with synthetic dollar models. ViFi’s synthetic dollar model for example is designed to offer local currency stability in high-inflation environments, without centralized reserves. The winners won't be the most stable — they'll be the most useful. Just as you can’t currently distinguish which dollar bill is coming from Chase and which from Bank of America, soon users won’t look at who is issuing the stablecoin. Instead, the yield and what else can be done with it will matter more. Regulators are fighting yesterday’s war with tomorrow's weapons pointed backwards. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are static instruments — issued here and regulated here. But what happens when a stablecoin issued in Singapore, backed by London real estate, traded on a Cayman Islands exchange, and held by someone in Lagos, eventually fails? Whose problem is that? The answer: everyone’s and no one's. Europe tried the heavy-handed approach with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. And as a result, Europeans now access the same stablecoins through DeFi, just with extra steps and (potentially) higher risk. The U.S. wants domestic oversight while Tether laughs from the British Virgin Islands, holding more treasuries than most countries. Asia is crafting its own rules, creating a patchwork where regulatory arbitrage isn’t a bug — it’s an entire business model. When thousands of stablecoins exist, each with different mechanisms, backings and jurisdictions, traditional regulation becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Except the moles are armed with smart contracts and the hammer is made of strongly worded letters. The barbarians aren’t at the gate — they're already inside, issuing tokens and earning yield. When this unravels, and parts of it will, there's no Federal Reserve to lower rates, no U.S. Treasury to backstop losses and no coordinated response from people who can't even agree on what a stablecoin is. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the chaos is the feature. In Argentina, chaos means 50% inflation, so a synthetic dollar backed by derivatives feels like stability that not all citizens are used to. In Nigeria, chaos means capital controls, so any dollar access beats none. For millions, these complicated, possibly fragile and definitely risky instruments solve real problems — and they solve them today. The thousand stablecoins launching this year won’t all survive. Most won't. But the ones that do will reshape how money works, who controls it and what it can do. Traditional finance took centuries to build safety nets. We’re speedrunning the same evolution in years, maybe months. Whether that ends in breakthrough or breakdown depends entirely on how thoughtfully we build today. As the GENIUS Act attempts to define what a regulated stablecoin, and by extension, a “digital dollar,” should look like, it may be racing against a moving target. The market is evolving faster than legislation can draft definitions. Disclosure: Sandy Peng is the Co-Founder of Scroll, a blockchain that ViFi is building on with regards to a stablecoin project.

They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

June 23, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Steve Laipply, Global Co-Head of Bond ETFs at BlackRock, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Steve Lightly is global co-head of Bond ETFs and investment giant BlackRock. He helps to oversee over a trillion dollars in bond ETFs. He’s got a fascinating background at both Bank America, Merrill Lynch, and since 2009 at BGI and BlackRock. I thought this conversation was really fascinating. There are a few people in the world of fixed income that understands the bond market, the ETF market, what the fed’s doing, what is driving both institutional and household investors on the fixed income side. I, I thought this conversation was absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with BlackRock’s co-head of Bond ETFs. Steve Lely. Steve Lely, welcome to Bloomberg. Steve Laipply: Thanks for having me, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: So, what a perfect time to have somebody who specializes in fixed income and bonds. We’ve had all sorts of mayhem with tariffs on, tariffs off rates, up rates down, yields starting to creep higher and higher. But before we get into what’s going on today, let’s talk a little bit about you and your background. BS degree in finance from university in Miami, MBA from Wharton Finance. Always the career plan. Steve Laipply: Not quite, so I went to Miami University in Ohio, actually. Really? I grew up in a small town in Ohio. Yeah. So went there for, ultimately ended up in the business school. I did start off thinking, you know, as many people might that, oh, what, what should I do? Should I be a doctor or a lawyer? I decided to try doctor. I love biology, organic chemistry, not so much. That’s Barry Ritholtz: That’s the gut course that screens a lot of doc future docs out. Steve Laipply: So I had a good friend who said, Hey, I’m taking finance. I really like it. Maybe give it a shot. I took a finance class, really liked it a lot. It’s sort of like math with dollar signs attached to it. So that’s sort of the way I viewed it. I really enjoyed it. And, and that was kind of, that was kind of it. I was hooked. Barry Ritholtz: University of Miami in Ohio is gonna scratch out my next question, which, which is how do you get anything done in the Florida sun in Miami? But Ohio I bet is a little easier study type of regime. Steve Laipply: A little bit. It’s still, it’s a beautiful campus, A lot of fun. But, but yeah, it’s, it was, it was a good experience. Barry Ritholtz: You come outta Wharton, we’ll talk a little bit about iShares and your previous history at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, but what was it that drew you to fixed income? Steve Laipply: I, I think a couple of things. One, I really, I really did enjoy sort of the, the variety of things in fixed income. You know, I mean, you know, equities can be complex in their own right, but fixed income, you can have so many different types of instruments and cash flows and structures. And it was just really interesting to me to see that variety Barry Ritholtz: And what do we have something like 3,500 individual equities outside of the ping sheets, and how many QIPs are there for fixed income? Millions. Steve Laipply: So I, I did this, yeah, I did this exercise on Bloomberg, depending on how you filter well, north of a million, right? Well, north and it, and it’s, you, you might even get multiples of that depending on how you filter. But yeah, fixed income as, you know, once you, once you issue that a company’s gonna issue debt, you know, perpetually, they’re gonna keep issuing new CUSIPs over time. Right. So, so it adds up. Barry Ritholtz:No, no doubt. So you’re at Bank America Merrill Lynch as a senior member of the interest rate structuring and strategic solutions sounds very institutional. Tell us a little bit about your time at Bank America Merrill Lynch. Steve Laipply: Yeah, so I, I think that group, the idea was to work with institutional clients to really help them manage risk, right? And so it was about using derivatives in particular in a sensible way to come up with hedging strategy. So my, my particular focus was on the mortgage servicing community. They, they had a very, very complex asset. They still do, it’s a little bit different now all these years later, but they had a tremendous amount of interest rate risk in those servicing right assets, right? So my job was to work with them to come up with, you know, thoughtful ways to hedge that risk. And, and there are, you know, some very, very vanilla ways to do it. But, you know, we wanted to really try to be, you know, more thoughtful and much more tailored. And that was, that was what I spent a lot of time doing. I really enjoyed it. Barry Ritholtz: When I think of hedging risk on the fixed income side, not specific to that era, which was kind of unique, I think, of interest rate, risk, credit risk, the underlying security that subsequently gets securitized. Am I warm? Tell me if Steve Laipply: That’s about right. Yeah. Barry Ritholtz: Okay. What else do you consider when you’re trying to find a way to hedge a fixed income risk? Steve Laipply: Yeah, and so you just, you just nailed almost all of it. So depending on what it is. So when you’re dealing with something like a mortgage servicing, right? That’s that lender, you know, sells the loan off, and then somebody retains that annuity that can get prepaid. So if you go pay off your mortgage, I go pay off my mortgage, that annuity disappears. There’s optionality there. You have to hedge that, right? So you have interest rate, risk, volatility, risk, things move up and down, the more likely you are to decide if rates fall to prepay. So it’s all of that good stuff. And then yes, you can have credit risk and other types of assets as well. You, Barry Ritholtz: You use one of my favorite words, optionality because every time I have a discussion with people who are not in the world of finance, and they say, have you ever calculated how much it costs to take your boat or jet ski out and figure out what each ride costs you? And I’m like, you don’t understand optionality. I have the ability to do that every single day. Whether I choose to exercise that or not, that is still a value that would cost somebody something. You join a, a boat club or a rental club or whatever, lay people don’t get optionality. Tell us how that applies in, in fixed, fixed income. Yeah, Steve Laipply: And you see this in different ways, Barry. So I mean, not dissimilar, right? So as an example, again, going back to the homeowner part, if you have a mortgage, you can decide to prepay that a lot of people don’t. Interestingly, there are stories that, that exist, and I’m sure you’ve heard ’em, where people still have 10% mortgages somewhere get 00:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Out. Is that true? 00:06:53 [Speaker Changed] There are stories about that. And so if you look at, at statistics, I haven’t done this in a while by the way. So hopefully after this long period of time, maybe they’ve paid ’em off. But you can find these very high coupon mortgages that are still out there and nobody really knows why they haven’t paid them off. But it is your right, but you’re not forced to pay it off. You would think you’d want to if interest rates were low enough. But that exists in different ways. Just like when companies issue debt, a lot of times they’ll issue callable debt. So same idea if interest rates fall or credit spreads tighten, they can call that debt and issue cheaper debt, right? And so that, that’s, that’s just sort of a basic tenant of, of how people like to structure their, their liabilities. 00:07:34 [Speaker Changed] My equity version of that is BlackRock s and p 500 fund is like five bips, four bips, it’s like practically free. And sometimes portfolios come into the office. And why are you paying a hundred basis points for what’s as effectively an s and p 500 index? Why don’t we save you 95 bips a year, compounded over 20 years? That’s a lot of money. So the market is kind of sorta almost efficient, is, I don’t know how else to describe it. 00:08:04 [Speaker Changed] No, I think that’s right. I mean, and, and over time, you know, we, we’ve really started to see investors gravitate towards this idea of efficiency. And you know, again, you, you, this is a theme that you really, really hammer home, which is, you know, basic sort of blocking and tackling is don’t surrender a lot of your return to fees. I think everybody thinks that’s incredibly important. It took a while for people to wake up to it, but I do think over time people have really started to understand fees matter, the strategy matters too. But, but fees matter as well. And so we we have to You want both? Yeah, you want both. You want both. 00:08:40 [Speaker Changed] So I know we’ll get to BlackRock starting in oh nine, but how long were you at Bank America for? 00:08:47 [Speaker Changed] From 97 through oh nine. Oh, 00:08:49 [Speaker Changed] So you quite a while watched the debacle front row. Front row. Yeah. Did you start at Merrill or did you start at Bank America? 00:08:56 [Speaker Changed] I started at Merrill. 00:08:57 [Speaker Changed] Oh, you did? Yeah. So a lot of people, slagged, was it John Thune? I thought he cut a great deal that worked out really well for Merrill employees and relatively well for Merrill shareholders at least compared to, you know, bear Stearns and Lehman and so many other companies. He, he did a solid and it took a while before people recognized it. What was your experience like going through that mayhem? 00:09:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it was stressful as, you know, I was not involved with the particular businesses that were under stress, but it was stressful for all of us Oh, sure. As the headline scroll day after day after day, you know, was a front seat in history. Sure. As it turns out. And so I think, you know, hopefully a lot of lessons have been learned from, from, you know, that period of time, as you know, and I think you’ve said this many times, each crisis looks a little bit different. So hopefully we take lessons from the last one and that starts building a knowledge base up over time. So maybe the next time we’re a little bit better equipped to deal with it. But, but it was, yes, it was an interesting time. 00:10:02 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. To say the very least, ho hopefully we take the right lessons. Sometimes we, we draw the wrong lessons. That’s a whole nother story. So how did you find your way over to BlackRock in 2009? I’m assuming that was once the dust settled a little bit. Was it late past March oh nine? Yeah, 00:10:18 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was, it was interesting. You know, you you have sort of contact and networking with different folks and I had, and it was at the time, Barclays Global Investors. Yes. And I, I, I did know, I did know a couple of, a couple of folks that were there and we had just, you know, had casual conversations. But at one point, and this is a former mentor of mine, gentleman named Matt Tucker reached out to me and said, Hey, you know, this is an interesting opportunity. It’s called Bond ETFs. It’s, it’s a business that, that I’ve really been working hard on over here. And I’m looking for a skillset that that sort of maps to that and, and, you know, I kind of think that, that your background might be, might be interesting for this. So, you know, let’s, let’s talk about it and then, you know, sort of the rest is history. But I, I was very, very excited about it. And there is a funny story to this, which is I discovered bond ETFs on my own sort of accidentally. I was trying to buy treasuries and I was very frustrated by the commissions I was getting charged on that. A colleague actually pointed me to the iShares website and showed me that bond ETFs actually exist and you could simply buy this on exchange without actually having to buy physical bonds and, and, you know, pay a commission for it. So, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] And, and not only was the commission, you know, next to nothing, the spread and the price discovery seemed to be a little friendlier to buyers. 00:11:42 [Speaker Changed] I was really blown away by that. And I could not stop, you know, scrolling through that website and fascinated by the idea that you could take bonds and put them on exchange. Absolutely fascinated by that and, and feeling a little stupid that I hadn’t stumbled on it before. But so, so the fun part about that was it helped a little bit in the interviews to be able to say, yes, I’m familiar and, and you know, by the way, yes, I’m, I’m actually a customer pro, albeit at a small scale, but 00:12:08 [Speaker Changed] For those people who are unfamiliar with BGI or, or Barclays Global Investments, eventually what I have argued is the single greatest acquisition in at least wealth management history. Barclays Global gets in bought up by BlackRock, and the whole iShares product line gets really super sized with just a much savvier group of product developers, marketers, traders, just everything about it went next level. How much of that were you there to witness? I’m assu. Did you start at BGI or did you start, start a BlackRock? 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] It’s funny because people often ask me, what was BGI, like, I was there for one month before the actual, it was, yeah. So 00:12:55 [Speaker Changed] Like what I’ve heard through the grapevine is it was a solid shop with a great product. Yeah. A little sleepy kind of back water. If you are at Bank America, Merrill Lynch and you still haven’t discovered their bond ETFs. Somebody is not doing the marketing job they should have. 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, it was, it was interesting. They were very much, I think quantitative and academically oriented and, and I think, I think a little bit of the culture was okay with, with being, you know, somewhat under the radar because it was, you know, a very proprietary place. And so that, that might be, might be some of it. But yeah, BlackRock did come in and, you know, they did, that deal was interesting if, I don’t know if you remember Barry, there were, there were some discussions about whether, you know, it would be some sort of a private deal or what have you. And then BlackRock kind of came in and said, we’ll take the whole thing in that, that was announced I think in June, so I’d only been there a very short period of time. And then it closed in the fall. And I will never forget, you could tell that BlackRock was, was very efficient at this because the day after the merger closed, the signage was up on the building. You walked in all the screensavers that changed overnight. You had a nice pad notepad with the logo on it and you know, no kidding. Some nice pens and, and all that stuff. So very, very impressive how, how they were able to, to do this so cleanly and, and quickly. That’s 00:14:17 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And I failed to mention BlackRock is a little shop over on the west side of the city, 11 $12 trillion in assets somewhere in that range. How big a chunk is fixed income and fixed income ETFs at BlackRock. 00:14:32 [Speaker Changed] We, we just hit 1 trillion in fixed income ETFs. 00:14:36 [Speaker Changed] So keep outta it. You’ll get some a UM soon. Keep, keep plugging 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Away. Keep plugging away. Yeah. And, and you know, the industry is, is now globally, the industry is approaching 3 trillion. We’re at around 2.8 trillion in change and we think that number is gonna get to six by the end of the decade for the industry. And we, we hope to be obviously a sizable chunk of that. But it’s been, you know, it’s been experiencing double digit growth, you know, for years and years and it’s just been a very, you know, fast moving river for us. Huh. 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Really, really quite fascinating. So Steve, you just mentioned you think bond ETFs can reach $6 trillion by 2030. Is that right? What is the key driver of that growth that’s doubling in less than five years? 00:15:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it, and it’s a number of things and, and we’ve talked about these trends. So I think you have, you have a series of waves of adoption that happened. And it’s interesting because where we tend to see the largest uptake of bond ETFs is when you have stress markets. And so I think this is, we, we have several, several test cases at this point. So, you know, we’ve had many ones since the financial crisis. So financial crisis happened, and I think that’s the first time where I personally started getting reverse inquiry from sophisticated investors asking about the bond ETFs because they noticed that even at the worst of it, let’s call it September or October of oh eight, they were still trading on exchange very robustly. Other markets not doing so well, right? And so that got the attention of a lot of investors at that time, products were probably too small for, for a lot of those investors. 00:16:18 But they became very intrigued by them over the ensuing years. You had a, you know, you would have occasional blips in the markets, whether it was, you know, some sort of an energy dislocation in high yield or what have you. But what we noticed was every single time you would have one of these stress markets, you’d see a huge surge in volumes in bond ETF trading on exchange that would get the attention of larger investors. They would start adopting the products. Why? Because when you need to trade something, you were able to trade bond ETFs even if other things were really struggling to trade. And so every single time you’d have one of these waves of dislocation and fixed income, you started seeing more and more and more investors gravitate to bond ETFs. The big one was COVID. So for sure, February, March, 2020, you know, even treasuries, high quality investment grade, you know, the whole thing e everything was seeing dislocation, right? And so that’s when we saw probably our largest wave of adoption in, in fixed income ETFs was during that period of time, same story. You saw things that people would just take for granted suddenly struggling, you know, in terms of bid ask and depth of liquidity. But what could you trade? You could trade bond ETFs, you could trade ’em in size. That got, at that point a lot of attention because now the products have scaled to a level where even the largest investors could use them in their portfolios. And so that was interesting. 00:17:46 [Speaker Changed] So you’re absolutely preaching to the, the choir. I have heard mostly on the equity side, but also on the fixed income side. You know, these ETFs, you don’t know what the underlying is priced at. They’re filled with all sorts of stuff. It’s really hard to get a print on when it hits the fan. You’re not gonna be able to get in or out of it. You’re gonna have giant spreads and no liquidity. That wasn’t true in oh 8, 0 9. That wasn’t true during the flash crash COVI and the most recent tariff volatility, even in 22 when stocks and bonds were both down double digits for the first time in four plus decades, ETFs traded like rock stars. Why is this such persistent squabbling, you know, you’ll see just wait. Is it that people are losing business to ETFs? Why is there so much fear and concern that for 25 years have been completely unjustified? 00:18:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s a little bit of, it might be a little bit of 00:18:49 [Speaker Changed] The sour grapes 00:18:50 [Speaker Changed] A little bit, but I, I think part of it too was after the crisis, there was, it felt to me like there was this search for what’s the next thing, right? What’s the next thing that could go wrong? Not quite sure where, why that focus shifted to ETFs, but it was ETFs and probably a number of other things. But I think the idea of a bond ETF in particular drew attention because the, the talk track was, well, you’re taking something over the counter and you’re putting inside this box and you’re putting this box on exchange. And that might, you know, cause some, some interesting things to happen. And in reality what we’ve seen is just the opposite of those fears. Barry, again, just, you know, you pointed out the tariff volatility, same story, different verse, right? So you have, you know, markets are really, really stressed. 00:19:39 You see a lot of dislocations volumes on exchange. Once again, set new records. I think, you know, on the day of the announcements, I think we saw close to a hundred billion dollars of bond ETFs strain on exchange. Wow. Way more than the, the previous record during, during COVID. But the, the sort of, I think skeptic has always said, well, you know, we haven’t seen a good test yet. We haven’t seen a good test yet. I think COVID was a good test. This was just a reminder, right? And so really what happens is, you know, the exchange keeps trading even if the underlying doesn’t. And unlike, you know, the fears, you don’t see these quote unquote forced redemptions or anything like that. Nobody’s forced to redeem an ETF. It can just trade on exchange. And I think that’s the elegance of it. It gets proven time and time again. 00:20:25 [Speaker Changed] So I just wanna define some terms you reference. ’cause in the back of my head I’m always thinking, does my real estate agent mom or my art teacher wife know what that means? So when we talk about on the exchange, we’re talking about anything that’s publicly traded that you could just log onto your online trading account, buy or sell instantly. When we talk about over the counter OTC, that’s one bond desk calling another bond desk and saying, Hey, do you guys have this 2019, you know, muni, California muni series, whatever, and someone has to go locate that. So over the counter means two people literally speaking to each other to engage in a transaction. Is that, is that a fair description? 00:21:11 [Speaker Changed] That That’s exactly right. And so yes, over time bond trading’s gotten more efficient. You know, in the underlying market you have electronic trading of treasuries and now, and now credit. But you know, if you go back 20 years when ETFs were, were first new bond ETFs were first new, it was still very much a voice market. It was a very much pick up the phone exactly as you described. And even today, I think even the most sophisticated institutions still believe in the, you know, efficiency and the elegance of being able to trade a bond ETF on exchange you’re trading. If you, if you just step back for a second and think about what you’re actually doing, you’re trading hundreds or sometimes thousands of bonds simultaneously at a penny bid ask on exchange. You actually still can’t do that in the underlying market. So, you know, it doesn’t matter if you’re an individual, it doesn’t matter if you’re a large sovereign wealth fund, that’s still a very impressive feat to be able to, to do a transaction like that. 00:22:08 And bond ETFs allow you to do that. But I wanna get back to, you know, you, you had asked what are sort of the long-term drivers. I think this idea of just, okay, you can trade these things when you need to. That’s important. Another one would be when we’re building portfolios and we see this both, again on the wealth and on the institutional side, do we need to build portfolios with hundreds or thousands of bonds? Or could we take a low cost bond, ETF as sort of the core of that portfolio? Could we then use individual bonds to sort of flavor that or tilt that in different ways and then maybe add our favorite active managers on top of that. Might that be a more efficient way to do it than just going out and buying, you know, to your point, picking up the phone and calling around and putting together hundreds or, or however many bonds which might take days or weeks. And so I think there’s this growing realization that, you know what, it’s fine to trade in and out when things are volatile, but actually might be more efficient to use these things long term in a bond portfolio. So I think that’s a huge part of the adoption too, is the recognition that this might be a smarter way to build bond portfolios in general. On, 00:23:11 [Speaker Changed] On the equity side, I am fond of telling people, before you go chasing alpha, why don’t you at least lock in beta? Yeah. And I’m, I’m pleased to hear that’s a similar approach on the fixed income side. 00:23:25 [Speaker Changed] Very much, very much. And I think it’s a, and and this has been a journey because, you know, you’ve run into this, and I’ve heard you talk about this on your show before. Everybody wants to believe that, you know, if I’m buying the security, I have intent, I did my homework, it matters a great deal. And that may be true for that security. But when you do that a hundred times, some of that starts getting canceled out, right? And so that’s when you have to step back and say, all right, if I’m looking at my portfolio holistically, I want a certain beta, I want a certain tilt, I want a certain amount of yield coming from, you know, one place or another, what’s the most efficient and the cheapest way to do that? And that’s, I think people are slowly recognizing that maybe the ETF actually has that, that has that utility. 00:24:10 [Speaker Changed] So this is a good time to ask a question about active fixed income investing. It seems like it’s super challenging on the equity side. We all know the stats, 60% of active managers underperform their benchmark in year one. By the time you get to five years, it’s 80 plus 10 years, it’s 90 plus. And by the time you get to 21, it’s a handful of guys like Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch. I don’t see that uphill battle the same on the fixed income side. It seems like fixed income active does much better than fixed income equity. Is that fair? Or 00:24:53 [Speaker Changed] I think there are a few things. So, so one, we think that all investing is active to a degree, right? Okay. You’re making decisions. So if you’re using ETFs, you’re making sort of these broad beta calls and you’re deciding, you know, which beta, which sector, what have you. So there’s an active choice there in how you build that portfolio. But to your point, strictly active in fixed income, what does that mean? That means that, hey, I’m going out and I’m assembling a bond portfolio. I’m gonna compare that to a benchmark and I’m gonna see if I beat it. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] And you guys have the benchmark, the, the ISU iShares core US ag, or as everybody calls it, the ag 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, the ag. We have a GG, we have the universal, which is IUSB. One of the things that we’ve been vocal about is which benchmark are you looking at? Because sometimes you’ll see a manager buy a bunch of high yield bonds in their portfolio. Not all, but like, they’ll hold, you know, a large allocation of high yield bonds benchmark to the aggregate, which has none. And say, oh look, I’m beating the aggregate now. That’s, that’s fine. 00:25:57 [Speaker Changed] By taking on more risks, 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] They’re taking on more risks, right? Okay, that’s fine. You may give some of that back every, call it five years. Right? What we sort of preach too is, okay, let’s get benchmarks that look a little bit closer to the risk you’re taking and see what you’re actually adding through security selection, right? So some of it’s benchmark mis specification, but fixed income markets still are less liquid, they’re more fragmented. So yes, there are opportunities there. And so, you know, people often ask me, do you believe in active or quote passive we call passive index. ’cause actually even in, in, in indexing still an active 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Choice. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. So, 00:26:32 [Speaker Changed] You know, wait, market cap waiting, that’s a choice. 00:26:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s a choice. And so my answer to that is we believe in all of the above, we think the best portfolios have elements of both of these things index and quote unquote active together, much better portfolio, much more resilient than just sort of suiciding one or the other. Oh, I’m all active or I’m all index, right? So we think both makes a lot of sense and that’s, that’s how we sort of design our product set give, given 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] The million plus QIPs, the million plus bonds that are out there. My simple thesis was always, if you want to be an active fixed income manager, how hard is it to screen out the lowest quality weakest credit, poorest, poorest yield relative to risk you have to take? And if you’re just cutting out the bottom half of that, that should do better than, than whatever the ag is gonna do or whatever your benchmark is. Because there’s, you know, hey, there’s 3,500 stocks, not all of which are great, a million bonds, there’s a lot of room for the bottom, pick a number, decile quartile, half a lot of junk can get mixed up into that. And I don’t mean high yield, I mean lower quality fixed income opportunities. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it, this is the trick with fixed income, you could see great opportunities, but when you try to act on them, it can be really costly to actually implement and that cost or just can you find that bond, right? So right. And you locate it, the search cost, the actual transaction cost, wait, 00:28:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s a search cost for locating a bond. I always thought it was kind of built into the transaction cost. I didn’t realize, hey, find me this that’s gonna cost you just to ask that question. 00:28:13 [Speaker Changed] Well, let’s call, let’s call that the time it takes to actually get ahold of it. You’re sitting in cash, right? And, and, and I’ve, I’ve heard you say this many times, you probably should not be singing in cash very long. It, it’s a medium of exchange. Right? That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. But, but, but this is the, the time it takes you to locate that particular bond and then you have to pay the transaction cost, you know, the bid ask on top of it. So you know, yes, optically you could see opportunities all over the place. The question is, are you able to actually move on them and implement them at the right, at the right price? And that’s, that’s where there’s a lot of skill involved in fixed income, I think. And, and 00:28:49 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard some clients say, especially institutional clients, listen, my cash, my money allocation, I’ve got that I’ve hired you to do, you are my equity guy, you’re my fixed income, you are my opportunistic distress guy. I don’t need you to carry cash. And I wonder how that impacts people’s thoughts of when you start to see 1, 2, 3, 4% creeping up as a cash balance, gotta put that money to work. There’s an opportunity cost of just sitting in cash fair. 00:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and there is, I think what has happened the last couple years is, you know, money market assets are, you know, in the trillions. And 00:29:30 [Speaker Changed] So, well now that it’s four and a half, 5% 00:29:32 [Speaker Changed] Now that percent, now it’s four point half 5%. And so there’s been a little bit of what I would call, I think apprehension of giving up that certain or what people view as certain, you know, four and a half to 5% and then moving out. The trick to that is, you know, if you wait too long right? The market’s gonna move past you. 00:29:50 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and we’ve watched it, you know, it broke below four. Yeah, it went back over five. You’re not locking that in. You’re taking what? Look, if you’re saving for a house or something six months a year down in the road and you’re afraid of, you know, 20, 22 type year, of course a money market makes perfect sense. But if you’re looking out a couple of years, you, you want a product where you can sort of lock in a higher yield fair statement. Yeah. 00:30:16 [Speaker Changed] And you also want to be able to have, so look, cash is great. We, we launched money market ETFs. Cash plays a role in a portfolio, to your point, it shouldn’t be a huge part of the portfolio. You need to get those assets allocated, you know, on a risk basis. So whether it’s, you know, equities, safe bonds, riskier bonds, it’s like an orchestra, right? You have your string section, your horn section, they all need to play together and just sitting on the sidelines, that’s okay for a while, but it’s, it doesn’t make very good music. You need to actually have everything, you know, kind of playing its role in the portfolio. And so I long term, that is what’s going to actually, you know, build your return, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? And I’m spitballing these numbers off the top of my head. I have to double check them. But I wanna say cash is a drag on performance four to five years in equity and nine outta 10 years in fixed income. Am I close there? Ballpark? 00:31:09 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t heard that part on fixed income, but, but I, I, I, I see your point. I mean, you know, if you just sit forever and the fed cuts rates, you’re going to miss it, right? And so that’s, that’s right. That’s, and you know, and I think the consensus right now is ah, you know, maybe they’ll cut a couple times this year, maybe a couple times next year, things can move pretty quickly on the ground. And you know, it’s one of those things where, you know, yeah, by the time you wake up and decide to move, the market may have already moved past you. I mean, to your point, we were at around four point a half percent almost a year ago. And guess where we’re sitting at today? Around four point a half percent. But it’s been quite a bumpy ride up and down. And so who knows where we’ll be in six months. So 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] The question is of if you were sitting in money markets for the past year, or you had bought some equivalent bond ETF, which performed better over the past 12 months, given all the volatility, 00:32:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, on a risk adjusted basis, you could say, all right, I had less risk in the money market and I’m sort of sitting where I was, you know, year. Yeah. But if 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] You’re in high quality bonds, how much risk is there really? 00:32:11 [Speaker Changed] If you, if you bought sort of last, if you, if you think about where we were closer to 5%, you know, you actually ended up locking in pretty good yields. Now the one thing I would say is it’s hard to time, it’s hard to time rates very, it might be actually the hardest thing to do is to time the top in yields that can be a very, very fleeting thing. So it’s more about get invested, build a durable portfolio, make sure you have risk in the right buckets. You need some high quality bonds for ballast, you need some riskier bonds for income, right? That all plays together with the equity side and the alt side of your portfolio. All these things need to come together. Yes, cash plays a role, but you will probably miss out on some very good opportunities. We haven’t had yields like this in 20 years. Right? So are you really going to try to hit the top when you’re seeing yields that have, are as good as they’ve been in a, in a generation? Yeah. So you can get greedy, right? But, 00:33:06 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of funny ’cause it, it, oh, I always laugh when I think about someone who’s 40, 45 years old on a stock desk, on a bond desk, have not seen 7% yields Yeah. In their entire professional career. And I recall people’s bonds coming up, like the New York City geo bonds finally got called 7%. Like they were getting, I’m getting 15%, what am I gonna do with 7% their, that was when New York City was gonna collapse. You can’t get 15% today, 7% treasuries. Hey, that’s a good deal. No one realized how great a deal it was, right. 25 years ago. But that’s just, just the reality. Yeah. 00:33:47 [Speaker Changed] And then you do have to go back to the mid two thousands to see yields at these levels. So it’s a great opportunity and we, you know, rather than saying, well I really wanna hold on until 5% I, you know, I mean you, you just may miss it. So we with, we think it’s just a great, great time in fixed income. 00:34:03 [Speaker Changed] A a absolutely. And I wanna just remind everybody who thinks they can time yields or the fed collectively, everybody has been completely wrong about when the Fed was gonna start cutting, how far they were gonna cut, how often they would’ve cut. Like the consensus could not possibly have been more wrong for like, what, three years? Yeah. Four years. Here comes the recession, here comes the fed cuts, here comes if you’re waiting, ’cause you think you can guess if you’re gonna be a macro tourist, best of luck to you, 00:34:34 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah, exactly. It’s build the portfolio for the long term, you know, and, and you may say, well, I could have gotten a higher yield, or Hey, I locked in a pretty good yield year. Either way it’s about the next 10 years. It’s not about the next month. Huh. 00:34:49 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. So let’s start out talking about fixed income today and the obvious spike in bond market volatility we’ve seen this year. Tell us what’s going on. 00:35:02 [Speaker Changed] It’s, we’ve covered a, a couple of these things, but it’s pick your theme. Okay, so let’s, let’s go back a few years. We had COVID we had the policy response to that. We then had transitory inflation, which became not transitory inflation. We then had the, we had the reverse policy response, which was to aggressively hike rates the i the most aggressive tightening cycle in, in 40 years, right? So people were used to seeing rates, you know, bumping up against zero. I think at one point the 10 year yield was, you know, somewhere in the, you know, 60, 70 basis point range at the very, very, very lows. And I think this was quite a shock to people who were just sort of used to seeing the post-crisis, post-crisis, sorry, quantitative easing regime. All of a sudden you have yields moving, you know, to a two handle, three handle, four handle, and then ultimately a five handle something. 00:35:56 To your point, many investors haven’t seen this before. And so it was, it was quite a shock to the system then we kind of hit sort of equilibrium. The economy seems to be doing all right as we talked about, you know, people were worried about recession, it hasn’t materialized yet. The fed, you know, paused for a while, started easing, then all of a sudden you get new policy initiatives coming in, specifically tariffs, right? And so that caused a general rethinking of the way the economy is going to move going forward. Will inflation come back, won’t it? It’s just been, you know, a lot of up and downs and, and as we were talking, if you just look at the trajectory of the tenure yield, you know, we, we just sort of do this large, you know, kind of sine wave between, you know, call it sort of high threes and high fours and we’ve been doing that now for a few years. So you’re just sort of stuck in the middle of, you know, kind of a four handle, but you get these ups and downs depending on, on what the driver is. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] And just to put some specifics on this, when, when we look at the broad economic consensus about tariffs, they’re generally perceived as inflationary, sort of a giant vat tax on consumers. I know a lot of people in the administration push back on that characterization, but if you’re spending more money on tariffs, you have that much less money to spend on other things. Therefore it should hurt corporate revenues and perhaps be someone inflationary. Is that, is that a fair assessment? 00:37:29 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s hard to say. So I think, you know, I’ve heard both arguments. I think really what inflation is about, right? So we, whether it’s tariffs or something else, you know, people often talk about these things is well that’s a one time shock versus something that happens repeatedly over and over again. I think some of that’s academic inflation’s really. I almost think it’s a mind game or an expectations game. The real, I think question is, does inflation, you know, a higher expectation for inflation somehow get embedded or get sort of resurfaced, right? As a result of whatever policy initiative. And so I think what the Fed’s looking at is less about a specific thing and more about whether people start worrying that inflation will be at X level, like, which may be above where the Fed wants it to be. To me, I think that’s what they’re really focused on is, you know, hey, we got things down, we’re at 2.3%. 00:38:23 And by the way, what’s interesting, I actually looked at this, if you go back to, let’s call it 95 to 2005, average inflation was around two and a half, right? Not two, right? So, so if you kinda look at a long, long time series on Bloomberg as an example, right now where we’re sitting isn’t too far off where we’ve been on a long, you know, 20 odd, 30 odd year journey. But I think what the fed’s worried about is will any particular action cause people to start worrying that inflation will be higher? And as you know, sometimes that that can become sort of a self-fulfilling thing. I think that’s kind of the concern. So I’m 00:38:58 [Speaker Changed] Gonna play devil’s advocate on every point you, you said, and I want to hear your pushback, but before I get to that, former vice chairman of the Fed, Roger Ferguson, did this accidentally very funny piece about the 2% target and he could not find an academic basis for that number, but he traced it back to an interview from the Australian, their central bank chief on TV in the 1980s. And he mentioned 2% as their target. That was the first mention of it. I, I mean it certainly was a credible target in the post financial crisis while we were trying to get up to 2% inflation and deflation was the fear. But once the cares act and the new era of fiscal stimulus passed, isn’t 2% kind of the wrong target. Why doesn’t two and a half or 3% make sense in an era of fiscal, not monetary stimulus? 00:40:01 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, I’m gonna say that is above my pay grade, but, but what I will say is if you look at a long, long time series, whether it’s two, whether it’s two and a half, I mean, I think generally right now we’re sort of in that zip code, right? So can they get it all the way down to a perfect two? I don’t know. And, and and do they want to, or you know, does, do you risk going to one and a half? I mean that’s, that’s for them to worry about. I do think that we’re not too far off. If you, if you were to look at this over many, many, many years, the worry is somehow, does everything that’s happening right now start sending you in the other direction Again, people worrying about it, does that start, you know, causing, you know, specific actions that actually lead to it to a becoming more of a reality? I think that’s what the fed’s sort of focused on. 00:40:46 [Speaker Changed] And, and I, I think transitory has become a dirty word, but i i we sometimes want stuff right now I can make the case that this bout of fiscally driven inflation was transitory. Transitory just took a little longer than everybody expected compared to the sort of deep structural inflation we saw in the 1970s. This wasn’t structural. We passed a giant, everybody stay home. Here’s $2 trillion, takes a little while for the pig to work its way through the python. Yeah, right. 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. I mean, yeah, you had a huge, huge fiscal impulse, you know, very, very significant fiscal impulse and sure it could take time for that to work through. If you couple that with the idea that you unleashed that fiscal impulse at a time when policy was still easy, the textbooks would tell you that you probably should expect some inflation. But I think, you know, if you look at just the way people had sort of entrenched their thinking post-crisis, they were caught off guard. 00:41:47 [Speaker Changed] When, when you were at Wharton, did you have Jeremy Siegel as a professor? 00:41:51 [Speaker Changed] I did not. I did sit, I was a little bit, I was a little bit disgruntled about that. It didn’t work, didn’t work out scheduling. I did sit on in on some of his lectures just as a, as a guest. So in the back row. But yeah, 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] I had him in here, I don’t know, two months after the first cares act was was passed and he was the first person I recall saying, Hey, this is economics 1 0 1, $2 trillion, the largest fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP since World War ii. We are gonna see a giant bout of inflation, maybe even double digits. And I, I got emails, we love Jeremy, you’ve had him on the past, but he’s crazy. We’re not gonna get anywhere near nine 10%. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And it was kind of shocking to hear someone stocks for the long run talk about inflation and bond yields and he turned out to be pretty dead on. 00:42:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Again, if you just sort of go back and you look at a large fiscal impulse coupled with easy monetary policy that’s right out of the textbooks 00:42:54 [Speaker Changed] And, and yet it was so hard, another failure of imagination was so hard to say, no, no, we’ve had inflation 2% for 20, 25 years. What are you talking eight, nine, 10%? Yeah, it just, it just seemed that regime change was so hard to incorporate ’cause it just seemed like such a break from everything we’ve experienced before 00:43:17 [Speaker Changed] And it happened quickly 00:43:19 [Speaker Changed] Very, very, very quickly. So, so, so let’s talk a little bit about the next easing cycle. I’m assuming that six months from now, by the time we get into the fall, the worst of the tariff is behind us. Things will have stabilized at that point. Is the Fed starting to think, all right, we can unfreeze the housing market a little bit and talk, talk about a few more rate cuts this year or next? Like what sort of timing should we be thinking about? 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That’s what the market, I looked at this this morning, the market’s pricing in a couple cuts by the end of the year pricing in a couple cuts next year. And so it looks to me the market sort of settled on this idea that maybe we’ll up with a terminal rate of around, you know, three and a quarter, three and a half, somewhere in that zip code. So, we’ll, we’ll see. I mean the cut definitely got pushed out to September, right? I think originally, you know, if you go back even, you know, a few weeks ago we were still thinking sort of, you know, mid to late summer, but that’s, that’s now pushed into September for sure. So, so we’ll see. 00:44:24 [Speaker Changed] So the big question is, everybody’s been expecting cuts for so long and has been so wrong. Is there anything in the data that you look at that suggests a maybe we’re gonna get it right this time in terms of the Wall Street consensus as to when the timing of rate cuts might be? 00:44:42 [Speaker Changed] Well you j you just said it, consensus has a funny way of maybe not actually materializing, right? So I think everybody’s sort of locked in on this, on this path now it looks like just the way the curve is shaped and everything else. Well we will see I, the data has come in, you know, it depends. You, you can find, you can find people who have raised growth concerns, but then you can also find the resiliency crowd. There’s, there’s just a lot of, i I think sort of mixed data right now, but overall, you know, the economy seems to be holding in pretty well so far, 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Pretty resilient. You know, one of the things I always look at are spreads and they seem to be relatively low for all the people running around with their hair on fire. They are, yeah. What does that tell us of the state of the economy and, and the state of the fixed income markets? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think if you, whether you’re looking at investment grade spreads or high yield spreads, right? The spreads to treasuries, they’re both pretty tight relative to historical, long-term historical averages. So yeah, the credit markets are telling you that so far they are buying the resiliency story. They think that, you know, balance sheets are still in pretty good shape. I mean you’ve heard this anecdote before that when yields were low, corporations did do, you know, very thoughtful issuance and they were able to lock in yields and really, you know, shore up their balance sheets and, and have these strong cash flow profiles. Now ultimately people will have to refinance and you know, that may be at higher yield. So we’ll see how long that holds. But so far spreads are telling you that the resiliency story is intact. 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] So corporate debt issuers refinance that at lower rates. Households did it, everybody did it except Uncle Sam, we’ll save that for another time. But if you’re a buyer of debt, how should you be thinking about duration? When do you start extending your duration? Looking to lock in a little higher yield on the possibility that we see lower rates in the future? This, 00:46:42 [Speaker Changed] This is the debate capital THE, right? So I think we’ve been very much in the camp of, you know, the intermediate part of the curve is pretty attractive. So you know, if you’re looking in five 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven, see a three 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven somewhere in that zip code, you know, whether it’s in treasuries or, or high grade or even even high, high yields in that area. Anyway, that’s the maturity profile. But if you look at that versus say 30 years, I think that, you know, right now a lot of debate going on, on the fiscal situation, Moody’s action sort of resurfaced that debate. If you look at term premium meaning, and you know, again, let’s define terms the amount that investors want for holding very long-term bonds has gone up quite a lot over the last several months. And I think all of this is sort of playing into this idea that yeah, longer term yields are flirting with 5%, could they go higher? They might, there’s a lot of ambiguity around what our fiscal trajectory is. Are we at risk for further deterioration? We are running deficits with a growing economy and that is, you know, and we’re running larger ones than we historically have with a, with a growing economy. 00:47:53 So that’s what’s caused this fear of the long end. Now are longer term bonds to be avoided completely. I think there’s healthy debate on that. I do think that they still hold some shock absorber value, right? Depending on the situation. So, you know, we like we, we kind of frame this as being positioned, you know, overweight in sort of this, this belly of the curve. ’cause we think that’s a sweet spot. It doesn’t mean that you should have zero right long-term bonds, you know, it could be having some might be a good sort of, you know, insurance policy in a way. 00:48:24 [Speaker Changed] So when, when yield comes down, bond values go up and vice versa. If you’re making a bet, what’s the next 200 basis points in yield? Is it more likely to go higher or more likely to go lower? It would take a pretty big screw up to send yields up 200 basis points. Not a zero possibility, but is that kind of the core bet we’re more likely to see move down than up? 00:48:51 [Speaker Changed] I think the current view is that long-term yields could edge higher on this time edge, higher 00:48:58 [Speaker Changed] Edge, higher like 25, 50 basis points that’s 00:49:01 [Speaker Changed] Been discussed. Five ’cause this idea that depending, okay, depending on how the tax and spending bills come out and how people score that and what’s that gonna look like for the deficit, et cetera, et cetera. You know, the discussion could be, could you see further pressure on the very, very long end? The intermediate part is probably, okay, so the real debate is, are we gonna see more of a steepening depending on the outcome of, of the, you know, tax and spending bills, et cetera, et cetera. That’s been the debate. Now if you get an unexpected slowdown, you could see long-term yields come down temporarily. And so to your point, you know, do you get 200 basis points up or do you get 50 to a hundred down? It all depends on, you know, the unexpected. By definition if you get a sharp slowdown that nobody saw coming, you probably do see longer term yields coming down. And I think not a lot of people are expecting that at all. 00:49:52 [Speaker Changed] Well except everybody for the past five years predicting recessions that never showed up. The other question that I always like to ask is, hey, what happens if we yields don’t go appreciably higher or lower? Can we just be stuck in a four point a quarter to four and three quarter, you know, money market yields, plus or minus around four point a half percent. What does that look like? Can we just stay in that range for 3, 4, 5 years? 00:50:20 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Are you likely to probably not. History would tell us that except for you had this long period that doesn’t look really like anything that we’ve seen. The the 2010s. Yeah, the 2010s, right. Yeah, it’s just totally unique. So unless we go back to the 2010s, probably not, but, but I think, you know, my earlier point, it’s gonna be really hard to call, like this is the best yield that I want to get into. It’s more about we’re gonna have ups, we’re gonna have downs, we’ll have cycles. It’s really about building that portfolio out for the, for the long term and getting income. So it’s the first time in 20 odd years the income is back in fixed income. So that’s pretty compelling. 00:50:57 [Speaker Changed] So if, if someone’s fixed income investor or looking to add fixed income as a sort of shock absorber to their equity portfolios, what segments of the fixed income market do you find attractive? Where are the opportunities today? 00:51:13 [Speaker Changed] We’ve been seeing flows mostly go into very high quality. So that being treasuries, that being investment grade, that’s where, you know, the bulk of flows have been moving into. And again, much of it has been in that sort of belly of the curve type of exposure. Now, mathematically as a shock absorber, you’re gonna get your biggest kick from the very long end of the curve. We just talked about that, right? You’re taking some risk there. So 00:51:37 [Speaker Changed] ’cause if it goes the other way, if 00:51:38 [Speaker Changed] It goes the other way, it hurts, right? And so the debate’s going to be, you know, will it play that role if you get a big slowdown, right? If you get a huge risk off, will you see long, long-term yields rally like they have in the past in light of some of the fiscal concerns? That’s the big, big 00:51:54 [Speaker Changed] Debate and the dollar concerns on top of it. Yeah, 00:51:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s the debate. But, 00:51:57 [Speaker Changed] And and what about, you know, we always have clients who are looking into their retirement, you know, I just want X dollars and not worry about taxes. If you’re in a high tax state, how are you looking at the muni markets these days? 00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, and I think Munis have, have really, you know, seen some whipsaw as well, right? So a lot of folks now look at, look at Munis and see some opportunities there. Again, this discussion around tax policy has really, really sort of caused a lot of volatility. At some point you just have to really make an allocation decision and if you’re, if you are, you know, in a high tax bracket, I mean Munis can be pretty compelling and they’ve cheapened up a fair amount. 00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] All right. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s jump to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests. Starting with what’s keeping you entertaining these days? What are you watching or listening to? 00:52:54 [Speaker Changed] Well, so the funny part about this is it’s so masters in business, big fan. I, we already talked about that, but no, I also, 00:53:03 [Speaker Changed] Whenever someone says that, I always feel like Rodney Dangerfield and Cady Shack keep it fair, keep it fair, keep it 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Fair. No, I right now, you know, streaming wise, my, my wife makes this joke. So she, and, and my, my older sons, you know, will watch Yellowstone or something like that. I’ve always got my laptop open. Right. And so she’s like, you, you, you don’t really watch TV with us. You pretend to. But I think one of the fun things I’m watching, you know, friends and neighbors right now, 00:53:30 [Speaker Changed] So Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. It’s fun. It’s funny. Are you, are you caught up? 00:53:33 [Speaker Changed] Not caught up. Not caught up. I’m 00:53:34 [Speaker Changed] Looking at, oh yeah, so the, well, whatever the last episode was five. Really fun twist. No, 00:53:40 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. Absolutely. But, but yeah, so on, not unexpected, but the way they execute it was really well done. Alright, cool. 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] That’ll, that’ll, that’ll be some good binge. And I, I, I am still very fond of binge watching Law and Order. I will try purposely to hold out. ’cause I do like binge watching, really all of the above, right? So whether it’s organized crime or, or what have you. So 00:54:03 [Speaker Changed] My wife makes eight o’clock, the screens go away. You gonna watch tv, you have to put that away. So that means right before I go to bed the last couple of minutes, let me just see, 00:54:13 [Speaker Changed] We try to impose that rule. It kind of falls apart. 00:54:16 [Speaker Changed] No, no. She’s the strict stern task master. She who must be obeyed. Alright, so let’s talk about, you mentioned one of your mentors. Tell us about the folks who helped shape your career. 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and many of them are, are folks who’ve moved on. But I, I think there are certain people that I remember, you know, who really gave good advice and, and you know, I’ll give you a couple of examples. I had a boss, one of my first ones out of, out of, out of business school, and he basically said, look, I view my job as teaching you. I want you to listen and learn and then if you work hard, I view my other job is to help you create financial security for yourself and your family. Huh. But you have to do those things in order for that to happen. So if you listen and you work hard, I’ll try to keep up my side of it as well. And I, that always struck me and I thought that was a, a, a great way to put it. 00:55:12 You know, he viewed his job as teaching, but also if I did the right things to, to help me in the long term. And so I thought that was really interesting. Another mentor, you know, told me that you can be really good at what you do, but you really have to get along with people. You really have to be able to know where somebody else is coming from, work well with people because you can be great at what you do, but if you’re not pleasant to work with, it’s not gonna get you too far at all. And so I think that’s, that’s another lesson. I mean, you know, a lot of times you like to think you’re right in a certain debate or whatever, but you really do have to learn to bridge those gaps or it doesn’t even matter how good you are, what you do. Huh. 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Good, good advice for anyone listening, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading currently? 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] Well, reading How to Think Like a Monk. 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] Huh? I saw that go by on Amazon. This 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] Was a, yeah, no, it’s pretty cool. I had a friend of mine, I’m not sure why he recommended that book to me, and there might be a hidden message in there, but I think that’s pretty cool. 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Don’t read too much into 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] It. One of my, you know, I I, I like history books and so, you know, I’ve read a lot of the Ken Burn stuff. I, I think in particular, the things I’ve been fascinated with the sixties I think really helped shape the world that we’re living in the For sure. So I’ve been a junkie of a lot of that stuff. And in terms 00:56:30 [Speaker Changed] Of name some authors and books you 00:56:31 [Speaker Changed] Like, oh no, Ken, the Ken Burns stuff. I love all of his Ken Burns stuff’s. Right? Yeah. Really like that. So, but, but I’ll watch any number of documentaries. I just think that really was a pivotal time for the country and the world and kind of has echoes and, you know, really long shadows. So I always thought that was, that was really interesting. I like a book that really kind of stuck with me over the years. It was about, you know, I love math statistics, all that stuff. It was a book called Against the Gods and it was the, oh, remarkable story Risk I 00:56:59 [Speaker Changed] Love about Peter Bernstein. Yeah. Oh my god. One of my favorites. One of the all time great finance books that most people Absolutely 100% should be reading. No, no doubt about that. So I always pick out a handful of books to read over the summer. I’m so happy sitting on the beach wave, crashing in the background, banging through book after book. What just came a couple of days ago was Ron Chernow’s, mark Twain. Oh wow, okay. And you know, Chernow did Hamilton, he did a bunch of giant books. I’m super excited about that. So I’ll I’ll let you know if that’s interesting. I can’t imagine it’s not given both the author and the subject matter. Alright, our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investing or specifically fixed income and ETFs? 00:57:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think the most important thing is you have to be honest with yourself about what you like to do. And so I, I have met, I’ve met students who want, say they want to get into the markets, and you know, when you ask why that is, they have trouble articulating why. So I think part of it is you just really gotta want to do this because if it’s gonna be your life’s pursuit, you gotta wake up on good days and bad days and still wanna do it. Right? And there are good days and there are very bad days, and you still have to have that same sort of love of it. And so if you don’t love it, right, if it’s not, if you’re just saying, well, you know, I heard it’s a profitable thing, I want to, you know, I have, I have these certain personal goals, that’s, that’s not a good reason to do it. 00:58:34 But if, if you really do love the idea of markets and just this, you know, really elegant thing where somebody, you know, two people on the opposite sides of the planet can somehow find a common price. You know, what, what’s the saying? A trade is an agreement on price, a disagreement on value. I always thought that was love the coolest thing. Love. Right? So, you know, just this idea that, you know, the markets find a way. I, I think if you love that, then it’s the right career for you. But that, that’s the key thing. Find what you love and be really, really honest with yourself. And, you know, it’s fair to say, I don’t know yet. And that’s why you have to feel around a little bit, you know, whether you’re, you’re trying different things, you know, you may land on one desk and hate it, rotate to another one and love it. It’s, it’s, it’s a process, but you gotta really be honest with yourself. 00:59:19 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of fixed income ETFs and investing today you wish you knew back in the 1990s when you were first getting started? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I I’m going to admit this to you. I I know many of your, your admonishments about investing. I was, I was an original sinner on many of them. Hey, I, 00:59:42 [Speaker Changed] I, no one bigger than me. I, I, I learned the hard way. So 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] I, I did in fact do a lot of the common mistakes. You know, I I I chase things. I remember, you know, during the original internet boom, buying some really expensive racy mutual funds, which I subsequently rode into the ditch. So I think part of it is, you know, the long-term idea, you know, really, really taking like that long-term view. Now I I I did learn not to panic over the years. Right, right. And not, you know, sort of, 01:00:14 [Speaker Changed] You know, useful skillset if you run a trillion dollars, 01:00:17 [Speaker Changed] I think try to, try to, you know, keep your money, you know, don’t pay away too much of fees and definitely don’t chase the hot, hot thing. I think being diversified, you look, it may not be fun to talk about with your friends, but having a broad diversified portfolio over time, you’re gonna be fine. It’s, it’s, it’s hair raising sometimes, but you’re gonna be fine over the long term. Yeah. 01:00:37 [Speaker Changed] Very often the cocktail chatter, i i it’s not what makes you money. I love the title of Ned Davis’s first book. Do you wanna be Right or do you wanna Make Money? Right, right. And, and that really sums it up. Yep. Well, Steve, this has been really fascinating. Thank you for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Steve lightly global co-head of Bond ETFs at BlackRock.

Title: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment—one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. “Looking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,” Bakay wrote, noting that “no key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.” Despite this, he admits that “the failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021” is a concern—especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. It’s that divergence—between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher—that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. “This is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,” he said. His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area—“likely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate”—or a dip into the $97,000–$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he’s not shorting the market. “I am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,” he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the “first signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.” The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. “ETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,” he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the “DeFi Summer 2025” narrative went viral. “People are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,” he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. The technical picture on ETH doesn’t inspire confidence either. “During significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,” he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support—both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a “pivotal level.” Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum’s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. “Positioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,” he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. “Altcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,” Bakay wrote, pointing out that “every time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.” He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn’t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. “SOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,” he warned. The key level to watch is $100. “There is not much of a technical support sub-$100,” and if “shit hits the fan,” Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins—Hype and Fartcoin—saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. “Fartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.” His closing thoughts were pragmatic: “We are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.” While he believes the market may be “getting too short at the moment,” he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. “I don’t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,” he concluded. “I would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.” In essence, Bakay doesn’t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It’s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility—especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847.

Title: The stablecoin evangelist: Katie Haun's fight for digital dollars | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In 2018, when Bitcoin was trading around $4,000 and most Americans, at least, thought cryptocurrency was a fad, Katie Haun found herself on a debate stage in Mexico City opposite Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist. As Krugman focused on Bitcoin’s wild price swings, Haun steered the conversation toward something else — stablecoins. “Stablecoins are really interesting and really important to this ecosystem to hedge against that volatility,” she argued onstage, explaining how digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar could offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the ups and downs of traditional cryptocurrencies. Krugman dismissed the idea entirely. It wasn’t exactly a turning point in Haun’s career, but it was one moment among others that have helped define it. A former federal prosecutor, Haun brings an unusual background to crypto investing, having spent over a decade investigating financial crimes and creating the government’s first cryptocurrency task force. After becoming the first female partner at Andreessen Horowitz in 2018 and co-leading its crypto funds, she founded Haun Ventures in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in assets under management. Hanging her own shingle hasn’t been without its complexities. Despite her role at a16z and the industry connections that came with it, the two haven’t publicly co-invested in anything since shortly after she launched her fund, and Haun stepped down from Coinbase’s board last year while Marc Andreessen remains a director. When asked Wednesday night at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event about her relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, she downplayed any potential friction while acknowledging they aren’t collaborators exactly. “There’s no ‘gentleman’s agreement,’” she said, echoing this editor’s question about whether there’s any understanding to avoid competing with her former employer. “In fact, I still talk to Andreessen Horowitz. You’re right that we haven’t really done any deals together of late.” The apparent lack of co-investment could reflect the cutthroat industry or the challenges associated with leaving one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent firms to compete directly with former colleagues. Whatever the case, Haun is now charting her own course, and at the heart of it is stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value, stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT are meant to trade at exactly $1, creating a digital representation of traditional currency that can move on blockchain networks. Indeed, fast-forward to today, and Haun’s belief in stablecoins looks increasingly prescient. Stablecoins — which barely existed in 2015 — now represent a quarter of a trillion dollars in value. They’ve become the 14th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries globally. Reportedly, for the first time last year, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded Visa’s. “I think people who looked at stablecoins a few years ago thought, what is the value prop?” Haun said Wednesday night. “You’ve asked me this before. You said, ‘Why do I need stablecoins?’ And I said, ‘I refer to this as an ‘If it works for me, it works for everyone’ problem.” In reality, for most Americans, the existing financial system works reasonably well. We have Venmo, bank accounts, credit cards. But Haun, drawing on her prosecutor’s understanding of global financial systems, says she has long been aware that the U.S. experience isn’t universal. In countries with unstable currencies or limited banking infrastructure, stablecoins offer something unique, she argues, which is instant access to stable, dollar-denominated value that can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies. “People in Turkey don’t think of Tether as a cryptocurrency,” she said Wednesday. “They think of Tether as money.” The technology has evolved dramatically since those early debates, certainly. Stablecoins once cost $12 to send internationally. And Circle says its USDC stablecoin is fully backed one-to-one by dollars held in JP Morgan bank accounts and audited by Big Four accounting firms. Little wonder the corporate world is taking notice in a big way. Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring stablecoins, as are other goliaths like Uber, Apple, and Airbnb. The reason is simple economics. Stablecoins provide a way to move the value of U.S. dollars using cryptocurrency rails instead of traditional banking infrastructure, potentially saving these retail-heavy companies billions in processing fees. But the shift has critics worried about economic chaos. While Circle and Tether are committed to having enough reserves to support their tokens, unlike traditional banks, there’s no insured government protection behind these reserves. Relatedly, if major corporations can issue their own currencies, what happens to monetary policy and banking regulation? The concerns run deeper than just economic disruption. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many lack the backing and oversight that companies like Circle provide. While well-regulated stablecoins like USDC are backed by actual dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, others operate with less transparency or rely on complex algorithmic mechanisms that have proven vulnerable to collapse. (TerraUSD has had the most specular crash to date, wiping out $60 billion in value when it nosedived.) Corruption concerns in particular came into sharp focus recently when President Donald Trump’s family issued its own stablecoin, a move that highlighted potential conflicts of interest in an industry where political influence can directly impact market value and regulatory outcomes. These concerns came to a head as Congress debated the GENIUS Act, legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. The bill passed the Senate early last week with bipartisan support, with 14 Democrats crossing party lines to support it. It now awaits a House vote before potentially reaching the president’s desk. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has been particularly vocal in her opposition, calling the legislation a “superhighway for Donald Trump’s corruption.” Her criticism centers on a notable gap in the bill: While it prohibits members of Congress and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products, it says nothing about their family members. Asked about Warren’s concerns on Wednesday night, Haun practically rolled her eyes. “I think it’s really ironic that Elizabeth Warren or other Democrats who do call this corruption are not running to pass crypto legislation,” she said. “Had there been rules of the road in place [already], there would have been a framework, there would have been clear rules for what’s a security, what’s a commodity, and what are the consumer protections around that.” Haun — whose venture capital firm has made numerous stablecoin investments, including Bridge (acquired by Stripe for reportedly 10 times forward revenue) — is largely supportive of the legislation, unsurprisingly. But she had one notable criticism when asked what she doesn’t like about it: the bill’s prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. “I’m not sure that yield-bearing stablecoins are a good idea for consumers in the U.S., but I’m not sure that a prohibition is a good idea,” she told StrictlyVC attendees. The issue comes down to who profits from the interest earned on stablecoin reserves. Currently, that money goes to companies like Circle and Coinbase. But Haun wonders why consumers shouldn’t get that yield, just like they would with a savings account. “If you had a savings account or checking account and you’re getting yield on that, you’re getting interest,” she explained. “What if you just said, ‘No, the bank gets interest, not you,’ and they’re lending out your money?” Haun was less nuanced when it comes to another Warren concern: that if the GENIUS Act is signed into law, stablecoins could become a vehicle for money laundering and terrorism financing. “Criminals are great beta testers of all technologies,” said Haun. “But this technology is highly traceable, way more traceable than cash. The largest criminal instrument is the dollar bill.” (According to Haun, the Treasury Department has testified that 99.9% of money-laundering crimes succeed using traditional bank wires, not cryptocurrency.) Meanwhile, she said, the regulatory clarity that legislation like the GENIUS Act provides could actually make the system safer by distinguishing between legitimate, well-backed stablecoins from more experimental or risky variants. In fact, as the stablecoin ecosystem continues to mature, Haun sees even bigger changes ahead. She envisions a future where all kinds of assets — from money market funds to real estate to private credit — get “tokenized” and made available 24/7 to global markets. “It’s just a digital representation of a physical asset,” she explains. “BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, they’ve already tokenized their money market funds. That’s already happened.” According to Haun, tokenized assets could democratize access to investments in ways similar to how Netflix democratized entertainment. Instead of having to be wealthy enough to meet minimum investment thresholds, someone with $25 and a smartphone could buy fractional ownership in a share of Apple or Amazon, for example. “Just because something’s inevitable doesn’t mean it’s imminent,” Haun said on Wednesday. But she’s confident the transformation is coming, driven by the same forces that made stablecoins successful: They’re faster, cheaper, and, she insists, more accessible than traditional alternatives. Looking back at that 2018 debate with Krugman, Haun’s persistence seems to have paid off. A major question now isn’t whether digital dollars will reshape the financial system but perhaps more importantly, whether regulators can keep pace with the technology while addressing legitimate concerns about corruption, consumer protection, and financial stability. Haun doesn’t seem concerned. While critics point to the fact that stablecoins represent just 2% of global payments, questioning their product-market fit, Haun bats away that concern, too. Instead, she sees this as a familiar tech adoption story — one that has played out repeatedly and often takes longer than people initially imagine. “We think it’s really early days,” she told the crowd.

Title: The Sources of Global Economic Uncertainty
URL: https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/478633/
Time Published: 2025-06-22T04:45:06Z
Full Content:
22 June 2025 Time taken to read : 5 Minute The recent surge in government bond yields has forced business leaders and investors around the world to confront a critical question: Should corporations lock in debt at current interest rates before they rise further? At the same time, higher capital costs and persistent market volatility are compelling investors to reassess their portfolios. The question has become increasingly urgent as the yield on ten-year US Treasuries has climbed 50 basis points to 4.5% in less than a month. The yield on 30-year Treasuries is approaching 5% after rising 30 basis points in May alone. Beyond short-term market swings, at least five structural shifts could reshape the global economic landscape, with the potential to upend corporate strategies, erode investment returns, and further undermine growth prospects. First, there is the United States’ deteriorating fiscal position. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest forecast assumes a ten-year Treasury yield of 4.1% in 2025, falling to 3.8% by 2035. But given that the ten-year yield is already hovering around 4.5% and interest rates are expected to stay elevated, the federal deficit could expand far more quickly than previously anticipated. America’s fiscal trajectory is already unsustainable, with the CBO projecting that the federal budget deficit will increase from 6.2% of GDP in 2025 to 7.3% by 2055. Even more alarming, the debt-to-GDP ratio – currently 124.3% of GDP – could reach 156% by 2055 if current trends persist. The second source of uncertainty involves credit default swaps (CDS), which helped fuel the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Since Moody’s downgraded America’s sovereign credit rating from triple-A to Aa1 in May, the cost of insuring against a US default has risen sharply, as markets increasingly treat US government debt as a higher-risk asset. In fact, US CDS spreads now exceed those of countries with a similar credit rating, such as the United Kingdom, and are trading at levels comparable to those of Greece and Italy, both of which are rated BBB. Similarly, insuring US government debt now costs more than insuring Chinese government bonds, despite China’s lower A1 rating. A third issue is the opacity of private credit markets, which represents a long-term structural vulnerability. BlackRock predicts that private credit assets under management will more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. As more capital flows into private markets – both equity and debt – pricing becomes less transparent, making it harder for investors to value assets. The continued expansion of opaque private markets also increases the risk of leverage building up unnoticed. Much of this debt lies beyond the reach of regulatory oversight, leaving analysts and policymakers without the data needed to assess or model the true extent of systemic risk. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes. Unregulated credit markets may be especially vulnerable to cascading failures, while persistently elevated interest rates heighten the risk of default. If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could result in widespread financial distress and job losses, ultimately triggering an economic downturn. Fourth, the relationship between the US dollar and interest rates appears to be changing. Historically, rising bond yields have supported a stronger dollar, while falling yields tended to weaken it. Since late March, however, bond yields have climbed even as the dollar has declined by 6% against the euro. This divergence suggests that global markets are repricing the premium on holding dollars and are now demanding higher returns. US stocks have also been volatile, suggesting that the repricing of risk premiums on dollar-denominated assets extends to equity markets. Rising yields reduce the value of existing bonds, signaling that Treasuries are no longer viewed as a reliable hedge against stock-market turbulence. Lastly, many Americans remain heavily exposed to equities. According to one estimate, stocks account for more than 70% of US households’ financial assets. This makes the recent surge in bond yields and the rise in economic uncertainty particularly concerning, as both developments point to fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The business leaders and investors most likely to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape will be those who grasp the far-reaching implications of economic and geopolitical trends. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes.

Title: Between the sheets glamour: Helen McAlinden on how to make your bed summer ready

Belfast native Helen McAlinden is a fan of natural fabrics, particularly in the bedroom. As a designer of the home range for Irish heritage brand Foxford for almost 20 years, she uses its new linen bedding in her own home, a sea-facing terrace in Blackrock. It comes in three stonewashed colours: a soft sunrise pink; an aqua green that is the colour of the Irish Sea; and a gentle glare-free white. It gives a look of casual ease, she says. “It’s not trying too hard but yet it looks really sophisticated. It’s light to sleep under, cool in summer and warm in winter, and you don’t need to iron it. I don’t want to iron or pay someone to iron for me.” It uses Irish flax that is woven in Guimarães, northeast of Porto in Portugal – a region known for its weaving – and dries faster than cotton. Its long fibres make it smooth to the touch and give it tensile strength, she says. “It’s also low maintenance. You just wash it and hang it out on the line.” Now you can see and touch this bedding range in the new Foxford shop in Dundrum Town Centre, as well as other outlets such as Arnotts, where Mags Fitzgibbon is the brand manager. “One thing Foxford has always had is distribution in the tourist industry, but it is more than that, it is a lifestyle brand,” says McAlinden. Indeed, its throws drape beds in ultra-luxe hotels such as Ballynahinch Castle and Ashford Castle and have found their way on to overseas hotel beds, including the Cornwall-based Hotel Tresanton, part of the Polizzi Collection. In addition to bed linen and throws, Foxford can supply almost all bedding needs, except the mattress, she says. For that she opts for a King Koil design, made in Ireland. She then layers her bed, starting with a mattress cover, made in Co Mayo for Foxford. A fitted bottom sheet is her foundation garment. Foxford’s new linen range has a generous depth of 40cm so it will fit any mattress height and stops you having to wrestle with the base to try to get the bedding over the mattress corners. She also insists on luxuriating under a top sheet, a touch that works in summer, on hot nights. Then it’s a featherlight duvet. Her main bedroom is bedecked in the aqua colourway, for it works with the warm grey of the walls, painted in Athena 858 by Benjamin Moore, and the seascapes of Dublin Bay that she can see from her home in Blackrock. The colours work with the animated greys and greens of the water breaking below. Her down duvet is Danish band Danica. “I spent €300 on it when I didn’t have €300, bought it in Copenhagen airport and carried it home as hand luggage. It’s the only thing I can sleep under.” On the nights when there’s a chill in the air, she adds a honeycomb waffle 100 per cent cotton throw, €139, also Foxford. The feather and down pillows are part of Foxford’s bedding range, made in Mayo. She opts for the empire-size, two of which will fit across her super-king bed. “It is an Irish-designed bed.” The new collection, launching in the autumn, will feature additional colours, including a denim blue, a deep inky green, a mauve and nacre, a pearlescent colour. There will also be stripes, fresh takes on toile de jouy, and contemporary checks for the Christmas market. The brand also offers a 400-thread count boxed cotton bedding set that can be customised with monogrammed embroidery or another such message, a great wedding gift to give. Easy ways to ensure your bed is well dressed, according to Mags Fitzgibbon, brand manager for Foxford at Arnotts Pillows should fit the width of the bed. If you sleep on a king-size bed buy king size pillows, which measure 50cm by 90cm instead of the standard 50cm by 75cm. This will fill in the gap in the centre of the bed. Continental pillows, 65cm squares, can be used to dress the bed. They also prop you up if you like to read or watch TV in bed. Mattress depths vary. There are about 10 different depths available. Before buying new fitted sheets, measure the depth of your mattress, to include any other layers; toppers, covers or electric blankets that will add to its height. Sales staff can then direct you to the brands that do those sizes. A flat sheet or top sheet has two purposes. It cuts down on how often you have to launder your duvet cover, and it adds a layer that feels silky to sleep under. When choosing a duvet, pick a size up from the size of the bed it will cover. Lay a king-size duvet on a double bed, for example, and so on. It gives a better look to the bed and hides part or all of the divan sides. It also gives enough cover to accommodate two people. The standard pillowcase with an inside flap, also known as the housewife, is so-called as it was developed in the 1880s by the Housewives Co-operative in Bolton to keep the pillowcase in place. Before that pillowcases were simple sleeves. Oxford pillowcases have the same internal dimensions as the housewife, but have an external edging. The pocket-springs in the Vesteroy mattress have been designed to respond independently to each other, meaning you can have a great night’s sleep regardless of whether your partner tosses and turns. The springs also allow air to circulate whilst you sleep. From €318 at ikea.ie. Rimel is a lacquered metal bedside table that comes in two colour options, the teal, pictured and a bone white. It stands 61.5cm high and has a circumference of 48cm, with a rattan top covered with tempered glass and a secret storage. €234.99 from laredoute.com.

TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN paid to a 15-year-old boy from Dundalk who died by drowning after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. The boy has been named locally as Kofi Owusu, from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said that the school is heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He told RTÉ News Kofi was a “fine young man, very kind, a very caring and a very diligent student.” Sharkey added that supports will be put in place for students and staff within the school community at this difficult time. The school posted a statement to social media which said that Kofi was a “very caring young man with a wide circle of friends” and an “accomplished sportsman”. Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He had finished his Junior Cert exams just ten days ago. Advertisement Junior Minister Thomas Byrne has said he was devastated to hear of Kofi’s death. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss. “Thank you to the Coast Guard teams, emergency services, and local volunteers who responded. “Please respect the family’s privacy and Gardai have asked to avoid sharing any images or details online,” he said. Local councillor in Laytown Carol Lennon told The Journal that the community is in shock following the tragic incident. “Kids jump off that bridge every year, and I suppose no group thinks the worst is going to happen, and yesterday it did. Someone had actually raised safety concerns about jumping off the bridge during the week in the town, and now this has happened three days later, it is just awful. “Everyone is thinking about the boy’s friends and family at this terrible time. “We need more affordable access to swimming lessons, and better water safety education through schools so children know what to do when it comes to public waterways, and also what the best thing to do is if someone you are with gets into difficulty, or if you yourself get into difficulty. There is basic knowledge there that we need to share, because it saves lives. “Unfortunately in this case it’s too late. This was a tragic, awful accident and support will be needed for the other boys who were there and witnessed this, who have lost their friend and been through something traumatic,” she said.

Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who died while swimming near a Co Meath beach yesterday afternoon. The teen has been named locally as Kofi Owusu (15) from Blackrock, outside Dundalk in Co Louth. The teenager tragically died after he got into difficulty swimming in the water under the footbridge in the River Nanny near Laytown beach. It is understood that Kofi, who was with a group of friends at the time of the incident, was visiting Laytown on Friday for a day out at the beach. His body was recovered from the water by the coastguard and his remains were taken to Our Lady's Hospital in Navan where a post mortem will take place. He was a student of Coláiste Chú Chulainn and a talented soccer player, he played for Redeemer Celtic FC in Dundalk. Gardaí say they are aware of videos of this incident that are currently in circulation and are requesting footage and imagery not to be shared. In a tribute, the school said: “This is a terrible tragedy for Kofi’s family and friends, the Coláiste Chú Chulainn community and the local community of Dundalk and the surrounding areas, who are deeply saddened by this event. “Kofi Owusu completed his Junior Certificate in Coláiste Chú Chulainn in June 2025. “Kofi was a very caring young man with a wide circle of friends. He was a diligent student and a regular awardee for excellent attendance. Kofi was also an accomplished sportsman. He was a member of the school’s under 15 soccer team and represented the school in the recent Leinster Shield final on the 19th May 2025. "Kofi was also a member of the school’s under 16 basketball team and represented the school in the All Ireland final on the 23rd January 2025. "Our sympathy and thoughts are with Kofi’s family and friends at this time.” The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department of Education and Youth have been in contact with the school and will be supporting and advising staff iin their efforts to assist our students. Redeemer Celtic shared a touching tribute to Kofi on social media, showing two of his number 6 jerseys laid down on a soccer pitch alongside a bouquet of flowers, with the caption: “We are heartbroken. Closed until further notice.” An outpouring of tributes from members of the Dundalk community was shared underneath the post. As a mark of respect, local soccer club Laytown United FC announced it had postponed a planned end of season presentation day scheduled for Saturday. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this heartbreaking incident,” the club said in a statement on Facebook. “We appreciate your understanding. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.” Meanwhile, this is the second teenager that has been confirmed dead in two separate swimming tragedies as temperatures remain high across the country. Peter Byrne (17) tragically died after getting into difficulty while swimming in the River Barrow in Co Carlow on Tuesday. The late Peter Byrne. Photo: RIP.ie Separately in Co Dublin, four teenagers were injured after getting into difficulty in the water in two separate incidents in Howth. The Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. Kofi Owusu, aged 15, from Dundalk died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Laytown on Friday evening Today's News in 90 seconds - 21st June 2025 Condolences have been offered to the family of Kofi Owusu for their “devastating loss”, local representatives said. Minister of State and Meath East TD Thomas Byrne said it was “devastating to hear of the tragic death of a teenage boy” in Laytown. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving,” he said on X. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss.” Cathaoirleach of Meath County Council Wayne Harding said: "A young boy has lost his life tragically off our coast this weekend. My thoughts are with his devastated family at this time. "I want to thank all those who responded to the tragedy both in a professional and voluntary capacity. I ask that we be extremely vigilant to the dangers all our water courses pose during these good weather spells." Local East Meath Cllr Carol Lennon said: "The loss of life in tragic circumstances is devastating and we, as a community want to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the boys involved in the tragedy that occurred in the River Nanny on Friday night. “What started as a great summer's day ended with the loss of a young life, a teen, enjoying the first tasters of Summer of 2025. "I would personally like to thank the emergency services who attended so fast and showed great compassion to the friends and families at the scene”. Councillor Sharon Tolan said “a dark cloud” was hanging over the community on Friday night. “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the tragic accident in Laytown,” she said on Facebook. “Please think long and hard before posting any commentary on any social media pages.” Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. In a statement shared on social media, the Coast Guard urged the public to take precautions and said rip currents “are the leading surf hazard for all beachgoers". Rips are described as strong currents “that start near the shore and rush out seaward, quickly taking you out of your comfort zone, from the shallows to deeper water.” If caught in a rip current, the advice from the Coast Guard is to remain calm and swim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. According to the Coast Guard, rip currents “typically form at low sports or breaks in sandbars, and also near structures such as groynes, jetties and piers.” Meanwhile, the funeral of teenager Peter Byrne (17) who died swimming in Milford, Co Carlow will take place on Monday. Mr Byrne was swimming with two of his friends when he got into difficulty. The young man's body was recovered at 11.30pm Tuesday night by divers from the Garda Water Unit within a 10 metre radius of where he was last seen. "It is with a very heavy and broken heart that we share the devastating news of the passing of our much beloved youths player Peter Byrne who tragically passed away this week,” read a statement from New Oak F.C. "Peter was a pocket rocket in the team over the last number of years. Small in stature but big in personality. He was a huge character with a touch of Roy Keane about him, not afraid of anything or anyone. "Peter was the life and soul of the dressing room and training and will be sadly missed by his coaches Ernie, Danny and all his teammates who have not only lost a fellow player but a friend. "On behalf of everyone at New Oak F.C we would like to offer our deepest condolences to Peter’s family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved him. May Peter’s gentle soul rest in peace.” In Dublin, the Howth RNLI volunteer crew were involved in a multi-agency response to two cliff rescues off the coast of Howth, North Co Dublin, on Thursday afternoon. They received reports of three children cut off by the tide near Lion's Head, which is a popular swimming spot on the south side of the Howth peninsula, close to the Bailey Lighthouse. The injured teenager is winched to safety by Rescue Helicopter 116. Photo: Howth RNLI Shortly before 4.30pm, the inshore lifeboat was launched by the RNLI, with three crew on board, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard Unit and Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116, who quickly made their way to the scene amid moderate sea conditions. Two teenagers, who were stranded on the cliff, were located by the Howth Coast Guard cliff team. As the team tried to recover one of the injured teenagers, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin, which coordinated the rescue, asked the lifeboat crew to remain on standby. While on scene, the lifeboat was diverted to a separate emergency nearby where a teenager had fallen from cliffs at White Water Brook, a remote beach below cliffs on the eastern side of the peninsula. Howth RNLI crew member climbs onto rocks at the base of cliffs in Howth. Photo: Howth RNLI The lifeboat crew were directed by beachgoers to a teenager, who had fallen approximately six metres onto rocks at the water’s edge, sustaining multiple lacerations and suspected fractures. A second teenager had swum to assist him and was holding him steady on a rock when the lifeboat arrived at the scene. The lifeboat crew made their way across rocks to assess the injured teen, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard and Howth All-Weather lifeboat. However, due to the swiftly rising tide, the injured teen needed to be immediately evacuated by a helicopter. The Rescue 116 deployed its winchman, who assessed the teen’s injuries and secured him in a rescue harness, winching them both to safety. The second teenager was showing the signs of hypothermia and was assisted across the rocks and brought aboard the inshore life boat. He was later transferred to the lifeboat and taken to Howth Lifeboat Station, where he was handed into the care of an ambulance crew and transported to the hospital. Helm of the inshore lifeboat, Killian O’Reilly, said: “This was a challenging afternoon with two serious incidents in quick succession, both in difficult, rocky locations.” "On a sunny summer’s day, it’s easy to underestimate the risks around the coastline – but the sea and cliffs can be unforgiving. "The teamwork shown between the RNLI, Coast Guard units, and Rescue 116 was exceptional and ensured the best possible outcome in tough circumstances,” he added. He urged the public to be aware of the dangers and know what to do where they might find themselves in difficulty in the water, especially during this spell of hot weather. “Air temperatures may feel warm, but water temperatures are cold enough year-round to trigger cold-water shock. If you get into difficulty, remember float to live: tilt your head back, with your ears submerged. Relax and try to breathe normally. "Move your hands and legs to help you stay afloat. Once you've regained control of your breathing, you can call for help or swim to safety,” he added. The members of the public are advised to call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coast Guard if they or someone else gets into difficulty near the coast.

Title: Weekend reading: A content-rich resource for investors, and a call for TA 2.0

What caught my eye this week. With AI chatbots and search overviews now vigorously putting the boot into an online media that was already on its knees, quality independent websites covering investing and money are shrinking faster than violets at an OnlyFans convention. Good news then that the curation site Snippet Finance has started maintaining a content hub for investors, with links to all kinds of resources. You’ll find a few Weekend Reading favourites in its listings. But there’s plenty of other lesser-seen websites, tools, and other useful stuff to explore, especially if you’re a professional or dedicated amateur finance nerd. Be sure to check out Snippet Finance itself. Creator Yuri is the Hemmingway of investment editorial. This introduction is twice as long as a typical Snippet post. Incidentally, I just dived into the Monevator vaults to find a similar listing I ran early in the life of this website. Of the blogs I tracked, only us, Mr Money Mustache, Financial Samurai, and Simple Living in Somerset (renamed) are still standing. Talking of the bonfire of the blogosphere, any investing maniac starting today who wants to talk about their favourite subject online – doubtless having been banned from doing so by exhausted family and friends – would probably have to gurn into an iPhone to create videos for YouTube or TikTok. Maybe that’s you – but then again maybe you’re more a great one for a witty adverb, rather than the next Mr Beast? If so then Monevator would benefit from a new and brilliant regular writer. We’ve had several over the years, but somehow they never last. Often they discover they haven’t got as much to say about FIRE, personal finance, or index funds as they thought they did after the third article. Most just can’t write the Monevator way. (It’s not so hard. Take the day off and yet still be at it at midnight. Never use two words when three will do. Add some obscure references to 1980s music and 1990s video games and you’re all set!) Honestly it probably won’t work out with you either. But I’d still love to hear from you if you’ve got a lot to share. Ideally you’ll be more towards the start of your journey than we are. Not phobic about smartphones and investing apps. Maybe you even bought an NFT of a cartoon gorilla during the 2021 crypto mania before repenting your foolish ways. But mainly you’ll be on-message with sensible investing. A bit of personal finance hackery – stoozing, credit card rewards, current account bonus chasing – wouldn’t hurt either. (It all adds up in your 20s.) We’d want a bit of personality in the mix. Judicious. Tasteful. Nothing too influencer-y. Can you point me to a bit of writing you did earlier? Brilliant. Get in touch via the Contact form if you’re the person all your friends go to about investing. Just so long as you write better than ChatGPT, and without it too.

Mashing up Gibson’s Necromancer (introducing Chatsubo’s bartender), in a world of affordable manufactured niche fintwit and financial micro franchises on X, Reddit and Substack, there’s something almost heraldic about sticking your neck out (and opening your wallet) to run a defiantly indie full service Website (remember those 😉 ) covering the gambit of UK related PF, FIRE and investing. Very 1990s/Gen X 🙂 Luv it. Long may you continue. Good luck finding a new contributing author. The root problem surely remains that FIRE, or pursuit of FI, for the vast majority of people boils down to earning more, spending less and stashing (MMM influence?) the surplus. How to string that out week after week is a challenge. As you wrote yourself we can all manage an article or three, probably based on our own habits, but to have the curiosity to keep seeking new opportunities is rare. I am always in awe of how people like Ermine find the inspiration to both keep going and maintain the quality. In my office I am the boring bloke that people approach every September when asked to submit their choices for the flexible part of our total compensation for the year ahead. That might make an interesting paragraph or three for those at my firm, but after that the well dries up. Hell, articles on cycling to work and packed lunches have been both done to death and made redundant by WFH. On a minor point, and I’m not grouching about compounding – > It all adds up in your 20s [stoozing et al. Is that really still a thing?] What really adds up in your 20s IMO is the muppetry you don’t do that your peers do. Primum non nocere. And this Good luck with the search! Hi I’ve been receiving your newsletter for many years, always looking forward to the interesting content and links. But since you’ve tried to monetise the site, the free content has become very week. Probably best to scrap it and concentrate on subscription. Interesting pieces by Swedroe/Alpha Architect and AQR. Problem is neither of AA nor AQR actually offer up any ISA/SIPP friendly, non-exorbitatant products to tap their research. Loved these from Snippet Finance “1984.. energy..made up 27% of S&P 500 earnings, today…1%”, cost of urban 1km tunnel in NY $4 bn, Paris $230 mn, and S. Korea $100 mn. Perhaps these explain why energy/commodities so underowned as a diversifier (despite mean reversion potential of being the worst performing asset class from 2011) and why UK/US infra ITs’/CEFs’ woes seem worse than you’d expect even given high rates. Nice set of links – thanks. Blanchett paper chimes with observations I have made @M (& elsewhere) over the last year or so. Interesting! I think it’s hard to get a younger contributor with the confidence to blog to an audience such as Monevator. There are lots of commenters who are deep into technicalities, strategies and picking of individual funds etc which can be somewhat intimidating, nevermind the suspicion that people are playing with a lot more capital than most 20-30 somethings will have amassed (notwithstanding City bonuses and tech stock options). Plus I suspect the audience may have a certain scepticism around those who have never been burnt by their own past poor decisions or inertia/inaction. However the FIREside chat format works well so having more volunteers in that space would be more than possible. Another problem here is that the traditional ‘content creation’ direct to reader model of the Web is dying on its feet. This from my Substack feed this morning: “Ten years ago, Google read two of your pages for every one visitor it sent your way. Now? Google reads 18 pages to send you one. OpenAI? 1,500 to one, Anthropic? 60,000 to one, That’s the new internet…We’re not writing for people anymore. We’re writing for bots. They read everything. Summarize it. Spit it out. No link. No credit. No traffic. No paycheck. Publishers are getting scraped dry.” Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: Digital Asset Revolution – How Blockchain Is Turning Real-World Assets Digital
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/20/digital-asset-revolution-how-blockchain-is-turning-real-world-assets-digital/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T03:40:59Z
Full Content:
The combination of established finance and blockchain technology opens up different opportunities for asset ownership, liquidity and worldwide access. The economic environment is experiencing a paradigm shift as the migration of RWAs (real-world assets) onto blockchain networks is exemplified by creating digital representations of real, tangible value, including the ability to be traded, fractioned and accessed worldwide. This transition is not a mere case of technological innovation. Still, it can be considered a recasting of our worldview of ownership, liquidity and financial inclusion in this digital era. The tokenization revolution gains momentum Real estate asset tokenization has progressed from a speculative idea to a multi-billion-dollar global capability. Among the over $250 billion of tokenized assets, Ethereum holds about 55% of the market share and settles itself as the leading infrastructural platform of this digital transformation. That will include US Treasuries, real estate, commodities and intellectual property. The gains in this movement are charging at a fast pace. Assets such as real estate, treasuries and others are now being converted to liquid on the blockchain, which has over 18 billion in market value, and the prospects of it growing huge in the future. In the industry, it is anticipated that even greater growth will be evident in the future, considering that the market of tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, is currently forecasted to increase to 18.9 trillion in the year 2033, as suggested by a study by Ripple and BCG. Busting the conventional boundaries The idea of tokenizing assets is so popular because it helps to address the essential inefficiencies of conventional financial markets. Traditional asset ownership usually involves large down payment requirements, complicated intermediaries and statement periods. Tokenization resolves these concerns since this technology generates digital tokens reflecting fractional ownership of physical, real-world assets. Think of real estate – one of the most illiquid asset classes. With tokenization, commercial real estate valued in millions of dollars may be separated into thousands of digital tokens, each reflecting a minute share of ownership. Shareholders can buy these tokens at a much smaller financial outlay, sell them off on the secondary market, earn an equivalent fractional rent of the underlying property and have exposure to genuine property appreciation. This partial ownership is in no way limited to real estate. Art collections, vintage wines, precious metals (such as gold) and even income streams around intellectual property can be tokenized, enabling access to these investments to a broader pool than ever before. Thus, the investment process previously open only to institutional investors and the super-rich can be democratized. The technology foundation Asset tokenization is based on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts whose terms are encoded directly into code. Such digital contracts automate several processes that have been handled by intermediaries up until now, such as the distribution of dividends or compliance checks. Embedding coded rules in digital tokens and the ability to observe and be linked to RWAs may result in financial tools enabling automatic compliance, capital calls and distributions, making more efficient end-to-end fund products. The blockchain platform on which such tokens run offers several essential benefits. Growth is institutionally adopted The tokenization sector gained considerable credibility with the arrival of large financial companies. BlackRock announced its tokenized fund in March 2024, and asset giants like Franklin Templeton have launched their tokenization plans. This institutional legitimization has fueled the adoption and made the space legitimate in the eyes of traditional investors. The use of tokenization in financial assets should continue expanding in 2025 as a concept and an implementation, as adoption among large banks and asset managers is already bearing fruit. These institutions’ participation contributes capital, regulatory know-how and operational infrastructure that needs to be adopted to get mainstream. The development of regulation and local dominance The global regulatory environment regarding tokenized assets is changing quickly, and various jurisdictions are approaching oversight and compliance differently. Increased regulatory sandboxes and similar programs will enable the permissible growth of tokenization use cases among financial institutions, with more nations in APAC remaining at the forefront. These sandbox regulatory places offer a controlled platform for financial companies to experiment with tokenization solutions. They closely collaborate with regulators to establish documented frameworks. This joint plan aids in balancing innovativeness, investor protection and financial stability. Nevertheless, there are still issues like regulation. The regulation of asset tokenization involves a serious debate between the necessity of data privacy and the transparency of blockchain technology. Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the legal maturity of smart contracts is unassured, putting tokenization ventures into question. Conquering challenges of implementation Although asset tokenization has excellent potential, it also has various practical challenges that should be overcome to be readily adopted. Success stories and acquisitions Asset tokenization is gaining ground in various sectors in the following areas. The way to the future In 2025, tokenized assets will coexist with traditional instruments, and combining innovations with tradition will generate specific hybrid models to ensure that the world of financial markets is faster, more transparent and accessible to more people. This hybrid scheme can be gradually adopted with enough consideration for traditional investors and regulators. Coupling the sale of tokenized assets with existing financial infrastructure opens up a massive opportunity for market players. Banks can implement new products and services, asset managers reach a wider audience of investors and portfolio diversification becomes feasible using access to new assets previously unattainable to an individual investor. Yet, it will be successful, provided it can overcome some of the present issues regarding the integration of technologies, clarity of regulations and market development. Companies that can afford to implement adequate infrastructure, maintain a proper compliance framework, and concentrate on the user experience will be in the best place to utilize the transformation. Conclusion RWA tokenization is a monumental change in conceptualizing ownership and value transfer in the digital economy. This innovation uses blockchain technology to provide digital versions of physical and financial assets, enabling the democratization of investment opportunities, increased market efficiency and new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. Although there are still hurdles regarding regulation, technology and market maturation, the trend is unmistakable because the industry is becoming increasingly institutional and the regulation less experimental. The companies that learn and respond to this change will be in a good position to take advantage of the future of the tokenization of assets market, which will be worth 18.9 trillion in the next decade. Not all aspects of the digital asset revolution involve technology. They include redefining the very structures of finance to be inclusive, efficient and accessible worldwide. In the future, we expect that the seamless connection of RWAs into blockchain networks will require constant interaction between technologists, regulators and financial institutions to create a more interconnected and globalized financial process.

Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs are near-locks at 95% odds of approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025, the analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg, wrote Friday. Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche spot ETF applications are also sitting quite pretty, according to the analysts, with 90% chance of approval by year end. If the above altcoin ETF applications receive an SEC green light in the coming months, then the development would mark a substantial milestone in the history of Wall Street. Thus far, the agency has approved only two categories of crypto spot ETFs: Bitcoin and Ethereum. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The success of those funds has spurred additional demand for crypto-focused ETFs and other related investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage well over $100 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reaching $70 billion in AUM faster than any fund in history, based on company data. Crypto’s two top tokens have long been considered to belong to a league of their own in terms of legitimacy, stability, and staying power, and even their approval for mainstream trading was no easy feat. Among the current batch of contenders for spot ETF trading are tokens that have significantly smaller market values and less established reputations than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin, for instance, is the world’s first meme coin; Avalanche is the native token of a network that boasts less than 2% of the total value locked on Ethereum. DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, boasts a market capitalization of just $5.2 billion, compared to $293 billion for ETH and $2.06 trillion for BTC, according to data provider CoinGecko. Should spot ETFs of such altcoins begin trading on Wall Street, that would mean that traditional financial institutions and retail investors would be able to gain direct exposure to the tokens, which have historically been volatile. Issuers of spot ETFs actually buy and store the cryptocurrencies represented by the financial products on behalf of clients. Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Decrypt it was a foregone conclusion that crypto ETFs would explode as soon as President Donald Trump, who campaigned avidly as a pro-crypto candidate, was reelected last fall. “It is regarded as inevitable that we’ll see many other single-asset and multi-asset ETFs of digital coins and tokens,” Edelman said. “The Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will prove to have been merely the first." “And all that’s just the start,” he continued. “Tokenization is underway and once all assets are tokenized, there will be thousands of ETFs, or their tokenized equivalents, launched. It’ll be the biggest explosion of investment opportunities ever." The Bloomberg analysts’ confidence that the SEC may soon approve so many crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH stems in part from the agency’s openness to engage with requests to list them in recent months—requesting updated details and public comments on numerous applications. The applications have been filed by several Wall Street firms, ranging from crypto-centric investment managers like Grayscale to TradFi stalwarts including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion,” Bloomberg’s Seyffart said. Another factor that has likely increased the odds of imminent spot ETF approvals for the altcoins in question is the fact that, in recent months, the CFTC has approved futures markets for all of them. Futures ETFs track the prices of derivatives contracts for assets, but do not involve the actual buying or selling of the underlying asset. While the Bloomberg analysts are confident that altcoin spot ETFs will garner approvals before the end of the year, the exact timing remains uncertain. Seyffart said they could come in the next month, or perhaps not until the late fall—but that at this point, the question is a “matter of when not if.” Brian Rudick, chief strategy office at Upexi, a publicly traded Solana-focused treasury company, told Decrypt that while ETF approvals for certain altcoins with lower trading volume may not necessarily result in immediately higher demand for those tokens, Wall Street debuts could have a dramatic price impact on more popular tokens like Solana. “While demand for ETFs on long-tail alts may not materialize, ETFs based on top assets like Solana will likely see strong inflows and may act as a large positive catalyst for the price of the underlying token,” Rudick said. “Indeed, the spot ETFs were the main reason the price of Bitcoin more than doubled from when BlackRock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 through the exceptional inflows over the first six months after launch.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.
