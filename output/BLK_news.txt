Title: 400 Billion Reasons To Believe In Brain-Computer Interfaces

Morgan Stanley’s latest report pegs the BCI market at $400 billion in the US alone. “Brain Computer Interface Primer: The Next Big MedTech Opportunity?” by the bank’s equity analysts provides timely research, signaling to investors that this emerging frontier holds potential to generate substantial returns in future decades. This 37-page report includes a commercial history, industry landscape and deep dives into eight ... [+] major market segments for early and intermediate adoption of BCI through 2045. Note: As of publishing this article, Morgan Stanley’s 37-page report appears unlinked to a dedicated url, but the PDF has been circulating the commercial corridors of neurotech networks. This article is not the report. I’ll update this article with a dedicated link if I find one; If you are unable to access the file, just reach out. In addition to a brief summary of BCI’s origins and commercial history, the report covers key topics related to medical device outlook and ends with some speculation about the more distant future of this technology. But in a word, it’s about the TAM. Investors and commercial leaders should understand the rationale behind the Total Attainable Market before they choose to believe it or not. The assumptions and fine print driving the analysis are the GPS for navigating BCI investment today more than any singular estimate. Here’s what you need to know: An important caveat: Topline estimates only captures “potential revenue from a single implant procedure, ignoring a potential replacement cycle and likely recurring revenues from software.” Curiously, while they cross-reference their BCI estimates against other implanted neurotech markets like “spinal cord stimulation ($2bn annual run rate), sacral neuromodulation ($1bn annual run rate), and hypoglossal nerve stimulation ($800mn annual run rate),” they leave out deep brain stimulation from their comparisons. "Cost components of DBS surgery. Cost of DBS device, surgery, total cost of surgery, and total cost ... [+] of treatment." Sidebar: I suspect this was not an oversight, but rather an attempt to avoid undermining their own bullish outlook by analyzing an implanted brain device that has failed to cross $2b in run rate; as Schalk et al wrote earlier this year, “30 years after the introduction of DBS, only less than 3% of patients with Parkinson disease receive a DBS implant.” For sake of understanding this close proxy market however, I dug up recent average US DBS costs from Bishay et al’s 2024 Review. In that paper, the chart to the left is followed by another chart that reveals how DBS costs vary by indication, from Parkinson’s to Essential Tremor or Dystonia. This variability underscores that no medical device is a monolith, and hints at the complexity of neurotechnology pricing and reimbursement strategy. BCI costs will prove highly heterogeneous, between incomparable device designs, surgical approaches, clinical protocols, intended functionality, and much more. Morgan Stanley’s report reflects this across various market segment analyses, but the authors keep the math simple with a low tier and high tier pricepoint. Let’s dive in. Authors segment BCI into broad categories of product and market, and defining and sizing immediate and follow-on markets for each. There are some limitations inherent to any market research of this scope which we’ll touch on at the end. While the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will need to determine appropriate coverage (reimbursement), they offer some ballpark estimates for sake of calculation: The cross sections between “Enable/Prevent” and “Early/Intermediate,” makes the analysis a little byzantine, but the math really comes down to which people will have skin in the game. Morgan Stanley's estimates for immediate BCI applications across 8 clinical indications Eight major market segments each feature an estimated population analysis that includes sizing rationale for both early-stage and intermediate-stage applications. A summary of the former suggests a near-term TAM of $80.8 billion (see above). The latter comprises a larger follow-on market opportunity worth up to $320 billion. Some key assumptions and estimates behind the larger, intermediate TAM figures: As a note, the above three areas are fairly well established in the BCI industry, with Synchron, Neuralink, and Blackrock in active clinical trials, with Precision and Paradromics set to join them following FDA Breakthrough designations last year. While the authors suggest additional indications like ADHD, OCD, anxiety could become BCI markets, they stop short of scoping these opportunities in this analysis. Beyond the above analysis, the report also explores eligible population growth projections, timelines for ramp up, penetration rates, and sales estimates on the early/intermediate rationale defined above for each condition. It’s tidy yet squishy math that doesn’t summarize neatly. After spending a day poring through these numbers and a year studying this market, here are parting thoughts for executives keen on digesting this report to inform their go-to-market strategy in BCI.

Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has made a substantial purchase of the company's common stock, according to recent filings. Over a two-day period, Saba Capital acquired a total of 109,474 shares with a combined value exceeding $830,000. The transactions, executed on October 8 and 9, 2024, saw Saba Capital purchase shares at prices ranging from $7.56 to $7.6. On the first day, the firm bought 29,482 shares at $7.56 each. The following day, they added another 79,992 shares to their holdings, this time at a slightly higher price of $7.6 per share. These purchases have increased Saba Capital's stake in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust to a total of 55,988,272 shares. The investment firm, known for its active management approach, has demonstrated a growing interest in BIGZ, which focuses on long-term growth and innovation investments. The reported transactions come directly from the latest SEC filings, which provide a glimpse into the investment moves of major shareholders and company executives. These filings are a standard procedure for tracking the buying and selling activities of a company's insiders and significant investors. Saba Capital's recent acquisitions signal a vote of confidence in the future prospects of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. Investors often keep a close eye on such transactions as they may reflect the sentiment of well-informed market participants regarding the company's performance and outlook. The filings were signed by representatives of Saba Capital, including Zachary Gindes, and Boaz Weinstein, indicating the firm's continued commitment to its investment in BIGZ. As the market processes this information, shareholders and potential investors will be watching closely to see how these purchases might influence BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust's market performance in the coming months. Saba Capital's recent purchases of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) shares align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, BIGZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.6%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BIGZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." The trust's current market capitalization stands at $1.71 billion, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.87, suggesting a potentially undervalued position relative to its earnings. This valuation metric may have factored into Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. BIGZ has shown positive price performance across various timeframes, with a 19.06% total return over the past year and a 12.5% return year-to-date. The stock is currently trading at 92.36% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its market position. However, investors should be aware of potential challenges. InvestingPro Tips also highlight that BIGZ "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may explain why the trust trades at a seemingly attractive P/E ratio despite its high dividend yield. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics that could provide further context to Saba Capital's investment strategy in BIGZ.

Title: Key DeFi service Uniswap launches its own blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/10/key-defi-service-uniswap-launches-its-own-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T13:40:51Z
Full Content:
Uniswap Labs, the corporate entity that builds products to use the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol of the same name, announced on Thursday the launch of a so-called layer 2 blockchain. The new blockchain is called Unichain and, according to the company, will significantly speed up the time it takes to carry out transactions on its decentralized exchange. “Unichain will initially have one-second block times, and will later be optimized to meet 200–250 milliseconds block times. This will feel like a near-instant transaction experience for the user,” said Uniswap Labs in a statement. Layer 2 blockchains, knowns as L2s, have proliferated in the last few years and include services like Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base. They work by compiling transactions and recording them as a batch onto the main Ethereum blockchain, a process that minimizes fees and avoids delays due to congestion. The decision by Uniswap Labs to launch an L2 of its own is significant because Uniswap—an open-source protocol akin to SMTP for email—is the most popular tool for DeFi, which relies on modular, Lego-like tools to carry out trades without a centralized authority. Using the email analogy, Unichain is like Gmail or another client built on the open protocol. In an interview with Fortune, Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherine Lader said Unichain will in time make using DeFi less clunky for users and also increase liquidity across the industry. A former banker with BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, Lader predicts DeFi-style tools will increasingly be adopted by the world of traditional finance. According to Lader, Uniswap Labs built Unichain with a mind for the Apple adage that building great software requires great hardware, and the company’s philosophy is based on simultaneously pursuing the crypto ideals of speed, low cost, and decentralization. Unichain itself is built on the L2 technology known as Optimism, which is used by a popular L2 of the same name and by Base, among others. Uniswap was created in 2018 by self-taught programmer Hayden Adams, who has since developed a second and third version of the protocol. In late 2022, Uniswap Labs raised a $165 million Series B funding round that at the time valued it around the same amount. Uniswap created the new L2 blockchain with the help of the DeFi research and development organizations Flashbots and OP Labs. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: China markets follow U.S. rise with lift from new Beijing stimulus optimism
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/10/premarket-stock-futures-dow-sp500-nasdaq-13/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T09:27:19Z
Full Content:
Shares in mainland China rebounded as traders found renewed optimism for more stimulus measures. Traders around the word awaited U.S. inflation data for September—and the implications it will have for rate cuts at the Federal Reserve’s November meeting. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai rise on stimulus optimism rebound A day after China’s mainland shares took a steep dive, Shanghai’s SSE Composite rose 1.32%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped another 2.98% as stimulus optimism returned. Markets were aided by Beijing’s announcement that its finance minister will give another stimulus briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York. The mood was tempered by producer prices, which increased 2.8%, above the 2.3% expected by economists. Europe: Shares waver ahead of U.S. CPI as GSK soars on court settlement European stocks slid slightly early Thursday as traders there also prepared for the release of U.S inflation data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down a marginal 0.09% in early trading, saved from steeper losses by an over 5% surge in GSK over news that the pharma giant had reached a $2.2 billion deal to settle thousands of claims in U.S. courts that linked cancer cases to its heartburn drug Zantac. The STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.21%. U.S. premarket slips with inflation numbers in focus A day after all three markets posted ample rises—and the Dow and S&P 500 both set fresh records—the main U.S. indexes were all down slightly in premarket trading Thursday. Investors awaited the pre-market release of September CPI inflation numbers, which will have implications for the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates—or not—in November. On Wednesday, cruise lines saw their shares surge as oil prices dropped, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings leading the pack with a 10.91% gain. The announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet—which dropped 1.59%—and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. And earnings season continues… Delta Air Lines reports today, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: BlackRock holds out during $49.2 million in Bitcoin ETF outflow amid Ethereum ghost town

Ark's ARKB ETF leads Bitcoin outflows as BlackRock's IBIT remains an exception. On Oct. 8, 2024, Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows totaling $18.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led the declines with $48.8 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC ETF recorded a smaller outflow of $9.4 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the only notable inflow, adding $39.6 million. Other major ETFs reported no significant activity, including those from Ark, Bitwise, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree. By Oct. 9, the outflows continued with a total net loss of $30.6 million. Ark’s ARKB ETF led the day’s outflows, losing $44.5 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded a modest inflow of $13.9 million. No inflows or outflows were reported for Fidelity’s FBTC or other major ETFs, marking a quiet day across the broader Bitcoin ETF market. In Ethereum ETFs, Oct. 8 saw a total outflow of $8.1 million, driven primarily by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which posted $3.6 million in outflows, and Bitwise’s ETHW ETF, which lost $4.5 million. Other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale, reported no inflows or outflows. On Oct. 9, Ethereum ETFs remained static, with no reported activity across all funds, signaling a pause in investor activity in Ethereum-backed products after the previous day’s outflows. The continued outflows in Bitcoin ETFs over these two days, particularly from Ark and Fidelity, reflect ongoing investor caution. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF remains one of the few funds consistently attracting inflows. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, saw limited activity, with modest outflows on Oct. 8 and no significant movement on Oct. 9. This dynamic suggests a broader market consolidation as investors reassess their positions across both Bitcoin and Ethereum assets.

Title: Japan to introduce self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with a 90% adverse event rate, and the U.S. is next in line

Full Content:
In clinical trials, a near 90 percent adverse event rate was recorded after the first dose. These adverse events were disregarded, however, as Japan approved the jab. The United States is also looking to approve these jabs in the coming years. Worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be released in Japan ARCT-154 became the worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines â which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists â saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This "biological printing press" could theoretically amplify the vaccineâs presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, âThese products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.â In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bioâs partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions, so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon.

Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bioâs partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions, so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon.

One of the two reactors at a nuclear-power plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania had suffered an accident. The governor ordered an evacuation of all vulnerable people within five miles of the plant as radioactive gas escaped. In the end, the accident resulted in no injuries or loss of life. Two decades later, The Economist visited the Pennsylvania hinterlands and found the second, unproblematic reactor still running well and enjoying strong local support. It cranked out power until it was mothballed in 2019 owing not to safety concerns but to competition from cheap shale gas. Now Three Mile Island is coming back from the dead. On September 20th Microsoft, a tech giant, and Constellation Energy, the utility that decommissioned the trouble-free reactor, signed a deal to return it to service. The utility will spend about $1.6bn to restore the plant by 2028. Microsoft will then buy its carbon-free power for the next 20 years. Having plunged through the 1990s and 2000s, the share of global nuclear power generated by new plants is now rising again (see chart 1). Although America is home to 94 conventional nuclear reactors, about a fifth of the world’s total, it has built few in recent decades. There are, however, over five dozen nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, mostly in China and Russia but increasingly in other places, too (see chart 2). In July, for instance, the Czech Republic finalised plans for a $17bn nuclear project. And interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), which are cheaper and quicker to build, is surging everywhere. A new age for nuclear power may be dawning. Demand from tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google, all of which are racing to find sufficient clean power to feed the data centres underpinning the artificial-intelligence (AI) boom, is turbocharging the nuclear revival. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, explains that even before AI came along, his firm’s promise to remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than it has contributed during its entire history was ambitious. Now, thanks to AI, he reckons Microsoft will consume five to six times as much electricity by 2030 as it anticipated when it set the goal in 2020. Nuclear power is well suited to data centres because it provides a reliable source of clean energy around the clock, unlike wind and solar, notes David Victor of the University of California at San Diego. The vast scale of nuclear-power plants also makes them attractive: running an AI data centre can require as much as a gigawatt (GW) of power. That could be provided by millions of solar panels—or just a single nuclear-power plant. Unfortunately, there are few decommissioned nuclear reactors in America, Europe and Japan that would be suitable for big tech to resurrect. New plants will therefore need to be built. These projects absorb enormous amounts of capital and are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations and long delays. What is more, the risk of overruns is higher today because the supply chains and expertise needed to build nuclear power have atrophied, at least outside China and Russia. A case in point is the recently opened Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, America’s first in decades. It cost $35bn, more than double the initial estimate, and was completed seven years late. One way for tech giants to mitigate the risk is to bring in outside investors. Last month Microsoft teamed up with BlackRock, an asset manager, and other investors to launch a $30bn infrastructure fund devoted to AI. Mr Smith, who says the fund’s firepower could rise to $100bn once debt is added, expects it to finance nuclear projects, among other things. He also expects three or four such funds led by other tech firms to emerge, and suggests that Microsoft “may participate in all of them". At the same time, tech titans have taken a growing interest in SMRs. Currently there are only two in operation, in China and Russia. But Western manufacturers of power equipment such as GE Vernova and Rolls Royce have been busily developing models of them, as have numerous startups. TerraPower, an SMR startup backed by Bill Gates, broke ground on its first plant in Wyoming in August. Oklo, another startup which counts Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, among its backers, intends to deploy several small nuclear plants by 2030. Earlier this year it signed an agreement to provide Equinix, a data-centre operator, with 500 megawatts of nuclear power that includes a prepayment that should help it fund construction. There are more SMRs planned or under construction in America than anywhere else in the world, thanks in large part to enthusiasm from the tech industry. Last month Oracle, a software giant, unveiled plans for a GW-scale data centre to be powered by three SMRs for which the firm has already secured permits. On October 3rd Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google, confirmed that his firm is also looking into SMRs to power its data centres. Chain reactionStill, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale. Meanwhile, the hefty and uncertain price tag of building conventional nuclear-power plants will continue to weigh on the industry’s growth—and big tech’s hopes of powering the AI revolution without spewing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Chris Womack, the chief executive of the Southern Company, which owns the nuclear plant in Georgia, reckons that public support would help. “The government must provide some cost-overrun insurance," he argues. Streamlining lengthy permitting processes would be even better. Governments certainly seem to be warming towards nuclear power, after decades of frostiness. At an event held during UN Climate Week in New York last month, officials lined up to reaffirm a commitment made by over 20 countries at the cop climate summit in Dubai last year to triple the global output of nuclear power by 2050. Fourteen big banks also said they are ready to finance new nuclear projects. Pointing to the surge in demand from AI, Mohamed Al Hammadi, head of the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, declared: “We have witnessed a step change in momentum across the nuclear sector." For it to continue, a mix of technical ingenuity, financial wizardry and supportive policy will be needed. Still, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale. Meanwhile, the hefty and uncertain price tag of building conventional nuclear-power plants will continue to weigh on the industry’s growth—and big tech’s hopes of powering the AI revolution without spewing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Chris Womack, the chief executive of the Southern Company, which owns the nuclear plant in Georgia, reckons that public support would help. “The government must provide some cost-overrun insurance," he argues.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Inflows Jump To $235 Million – Is The Bull Market Heating Up?

Full Content:
Bitcoin’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are once again generating headlines due to an extraordinary increase in inflows. An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US Selling Pressure Slams Bitcoin ETFs: $408 Million in Outflows

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Bitcoin (BTC) appears stuck at the $62,000 threshold today as selling pressure from institutional investors obscures its gains. Critical data, such as the Coinbase Premium Index and ETF outflows, shows that US institutions are leading the sell-off. Moreover, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed notable outflows, with more than $408 million exiting the funds in the first week of October. This bearish market outlook has affected Bitcoin’s overall performance in October. According to CryptoQuant data, one clear indicator of Bitcoin’s troubles is the negative Coinbase Premium Index. This index tracks the price difference between Coinbase and Binance for Bitcoin. The index has stayed in negative territory in October, meaning that Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase is lower than on Binance. This suggests that US institutions sell more Bitcoin than global retail buyers, exerting a stronger bearish momentum on the asset. Another on-chain analyst, Maartunn, shared this information. Maartum noted, “The Coinbase Premium has fallen to -$41, signaling strong selling pressure from US institutions.” The Coinbase Premium has fallen to -$41, signaling strong selling pressure from U.S. institutions 😬 pic.twitter.com/mjKcfIaJ0s — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 8, 2024 One X user believes the impact of this negative data will likely “be felt tomorrow, not today.” Typically, positive readings from this index are followed by BTC price gains, while negative ones like the recent data signal declines. Concerns about a possible Bitcoin correction have grown, but the index is still negative. Another vital factor to consider is the outflow from BTC ETFs in the US. Coinglass data shows that BTC ETFs saw net outflows of over $408 million in the first week of October. This outflow suggests that US investors are withdrawing money from Bitcoin-related investments. In contrast, only around $260 million has flowed into these ETFs during the same period. This imbalance further points to a selling trend. BlackRock, a major player in the ETF space, also recorded significant withdrawals recently. CryptoQuant reported that the company withdrew 256 BTC, marking the second-biggest outflow from BlackRock. According to Glassnode’s recent report, a tool called UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows that Bitcoin is now in a delicate price zone. “This paints a picture of a market that rests on delicate ground, with a large volume of supply likely to be sensitive to the next major market move,” said Glassnode. URPD often measures how much Bitcoin was traded at different price levels. In addition, Glassnode wrote that a large volume of Bitcoin has been traded at around $62,600, making it a fundamental level. So, if Bitcoin fails to hold this price and drops below $60,000, there could be further declines toward $52,000. Conversely, if Bitcoin breaks the resistance at $64,000, it could quickly rally past $72,000. Meanwhile, most short-term holders are profitable, with a profit-to-loss ratio 1.2. This suggests that for every Bitcoin held at a loss, 1.2 are held in profit. According to Glassnode, the ratio recently exceeded its usual range, signaling a potential shift in investor confidence. The ongoing selling pressure from US institutional investors continued to shape Bitcoin’s market in October. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Letters: Dublin Bus has changed with the times – and not always for the better

Dublin Bus is putting security guards on services to combat antisocial behaviour. Photo: Getty The Dublin Bus pilot scheme – in which security guards will be on buses to tackle antisocial behaviour – has to be welcomed by staff and customers alike. The news is also tinged with sadness that this is where we are now. Many of us remember the friendly, efficient and helpful bus conductors of times past. They were great ambassadors for public bus service and our capital city. We are reminded daily of the speed in which people in so many areas of public service people have been replaced by technology. Yes, technology has been so beneficial, and it continues to grow, yet it will never replace being face to face with a fellow human being. Dublin Bus might also consider having some staff available to check the occupancy of clearly designated seats for vulnerable passengers. As a daily user of public transport, I see young children in those seats, while elderly, disabled and pregnant women cling to the rails for dear life to get to their destination. Alice Leahy, Alice Leahy Trust, Dublin 8 According to a newspaper report last weekend, Russian agents succeeded in “honeytrapping” an Irish parliamentarian into working for them. Apparently their recruitment criteria included someone with a large ego, sex drive and dubious links. Based on these selection criteria, which TDs and senators can we eliminate from our enquiries? Frank Schnittger, Blessington, Co Wicklow The Bible says “Love one another with brotherly affection” (Romans 12:10) and Donald Trump has certainly lived up to this. In his latest book, War, veteran reporter Bob Woodward tells us that Trump provided medical support to his political “brother” Vladimir Putin, by sending him Covid tests (they share a great fear of germs). They also stay in contact by phone. The suggestion by Trump that he would end the war in Ukraine if he wins next month’s US presidential election isn’t likely to be as a result of his skills as a negotiator, but his total capitulation to Putin. This isn’t really a friendship of equals. Trump is desperately seeking the approval of a perceived strongman, who is actually a tyrant. Who needs enemies when you have friends like this? The final word on this friendship can be attributed to Sun Tzu, the Chinese military general, who is credited with the phrase “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer”. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne Denis Doyle mentions that the late Kris Kristofferson supported the Palestinian cause (‘Kris Kristofferson was a steadfast social activist and proud political outlaw’, Irish Independent, Letters, October 9). Johnny Cash was Kristofferson’s fellow member of The Highwaymen country supergroup. Together with his wife June Carter-Cash, he was a regular visitor to Israel. In the mid-1990s, when Israeli cities, and particularly Jerusalem, were attacked by Palestinian suicide bombers, tourism to Israel fell off sharply. The Cashes, then in their 60s, travelled to Israel and with their own money, made a TV film titled Return to the Holy Land. Throughout the film the Cashes told their fans that Israel was as safe and beautiful as ever and that they should not hesitate to visit. Their love of Israel still resonates with me and others to this day. Karl Martin, Bayside, Dublin 13 The RTÉ Investigates programme on treatment of bull calves destined for export will have shocked anyone with a whit of compassion for animals. The programme covered topics such as calves being beaten, prodded with pitchforks, dragged by the ears, and carcasses left to rot, posing a disease risk. And that’s even before we consider the ethics of sending animals on excessively long and stressful sea journeys to slaughter. I suspect even the hardest heart would have been moved, if only for a few seconds, by the sight and sound of those calves, with their soulful, pleading eyes – animals consigned to distant shores by people seemingly oblivious to the suffering. We have a serious animal cruelty problem in Ireland. Whether it’s a bull calf earmarked for export, a severely confined battery hen, a horse being prodded or whipped, or a hare in front of two hyped-up dogs, no animal deserves to have its short life turned into veritable hell on earth. John Fitzgerald, Callan, Co Kilkenny When I started education in the mid-1950s, many teachers asserted their authority by beating their pupils. Thankfully, those days are long gone. But there appears to be a residue of a thirst for control by educators. This nonsense of banning mobile phones in secondary schools and placing them in pouches is a perfect example. The expense does not concern me. But the motive behind it does. We pride ourselves as a hi-tech nation, and rightly so. Tens of thousands of jobs are provided in the sector. Am I alone in wondering about the absurdity of this device ban? I’m 72. I’ve seen how administration worked in the pencil-and-paper era, and how technology has revolutionised the way that we now do business. Are we seriously asking smart teenagers to go back to the business equivalent of the ass and cart during school hours? I can only conclude that the Department of Education and the teaching profession see it as a way to assert authority for its own sake. Larry Dunne, Rosslare, Co Wexford The decision of the UK government not to contribute any further to the rebuilding of Casement Park in Belfast ahead of the Euro 28 football tournament makes it imperative for the GAA and the Irish Government to fill that void on a 50-50 basis. Only an immediate formal declaration to this effect can now save that laudable project. Even if, at present, the completion of the project is found to be over-ambitious, a partial completion of the project is to be preferred rather than leaving the stadium to fester as an eyesore.

Wall Street continued gaining Wednesday, with two major U.S. indexes closing at new record highs. Soaring stocks in the U.S. come in stark contrast to China, where markets plunged on a lack of new stimulus announcements. Here’s a look at the stock market today: US: Wall Street surges on good news for cruise linesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both set fresh records on Wednesday, as oil prices dropped and cruise lines saw stocks surge. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings led the pack, closing up 10.91%. The Dow climbed 1.03% while the S&P 500 was up 0.71%. The Nasdaq also gained, climbing 0.60%, but the announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Europe: Markets close up across the board despite Germany’s shrinking economy The German government said Wednesday that it expects its economy to shrink for a second year, but the DAX Performance Index still closed up 0.99% as gains in tech, retail and industrials boosted shares. Markets rose slightly early in the day, but really gained once trading opened in the U.S. where investors are eyeing the release of minutes from the latest Federal Reserve Board meeting. The STOXX Europe 600 closed up 0.66%. China: Stimulus sadness slumps stocks A day after Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index experienced its sharpest one-day drop since 2008, mainland Chinese stocks also saw a significant decline. The Shanghai SSE Composite fell by 6.62%, while Hong Kong shed another 1.38% as investors remained unconvinced by Beijing’s Tuesday briefing on its stimulus plans, which lacked substantial details and new major measures. China’s finance minister is set to provide another update on Saturday, with investors hoping for more robust actions to stimulate the economy. Japan: Nikkei rises as 7-Eleven owner shares rise on higher bidIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.87%, driven by a surge in Seven & i Holdings shares. The retailer’s stock jumped as much as 11.7% before closing up 4.71%, following news that Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard had raised its takeover bid by about 20%, according to Bloomberg. Tech stocks also gained as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament ahead of the snap elections on October 27, aiming to strengthen his position. Finally, earnings season is here: Wells Fargo and BlackRock will share their earnings on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Is Micron Technology (MU) the Best AI Data Center Stock to Buy Now?

Time Published: 2024-10-09T20:24:32Z
Full Content:
We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other AI data center stocks. The AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem. AI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. While AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%. The AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Our Methodology For this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120 Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes and sells memory and storage products. The company markets DRAM and NAND memory products, which are both essential in AI data center CPUs and GPUs. As hyperscalers commit billions towards developing data centers, the firm has witnessed a surge in orders. This has translated to a welcome boost for the earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm posted net income of $887 million on revenue of $7.75 billion. This represented a 93% jump from $4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were $1.18 a share. Micron Technology said first quarter revenue will be about $8.7 billion, well ahead of Wall Street estimates of $8.21 billion. Overall MU ranks 9th on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Indigenous groups in Brazil: We were not consulted on carbon credits

Thursday, 10 Oct 2024 FILE PHOTO: Indigenous leader Alessandra Korap Munduruku takes part in a protest for land demarcation and against President Jair Bolsonaro's government, in Brasilia, Brazil June 16, 2021. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/File Photo BRASILIA (Reuters) - Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state. Amazon.com Inc and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom. At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities. But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them. "It is unacceptable for the government of Pará to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter. "Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said. Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and Walmart in the carbon credit purchase was worrying, as well as that of asset manager BlackRock, which she said had a destructive footprint in her region. "Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods." The governor's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb. The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week. Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Pará gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations. Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms. Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.

Title: Ethereum dominance struggles at 13% – What’s going on?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-dominance-struggles-at-13-whats-going-on/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T20:00:08Z

Several factors have spurred Ethereum’s declining dominance and its underperformance against Bitcoin. Ethereum [ETH] has been underperforming against Bitcoin [BTC] over the past year. For instance, Bitcoin has gained more than 120% year-on-year (YoY), while Ethereum has gained around 50%. Ethereum’s underperformance has seen its market dominance tank to range lows. At press time, it stood at 13.85%, a notable drop from a yearly high of nearly 20%. Source: TradingView Several factors have spurred the declining dominance of the largest altcoin, and its underperformance against Bitcoin. Bitcoin has witnessed a significant increase in dominance this year. This metric has been forming higher highs and moving within an ascending channel since the start of the year. Source: TradingView One key factor triggering a rise in Bitcoin’s dominance is the high demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold more than $57 billion worth of BTC. This shows high institutional interest that is fuelling positive price performance. The other factor causing a drop in Ethereum dominance is whale selling activity. On the 8th of October, a large address that participated in the 2014 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) deposited 5,000 ETH to Kraken, valued at $12M. This whale has deposited around 50,000 ETH valued at $125M to exchanges in the last two weeks per SpotOnChain. The Ethereum Foundation, which has also been on a selling spree, has contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance. Since the beginning of the year, this institution has sold more than $10M worth of ETH. An uptick in whale selling activity without a rise in demand could see ETH continue trading rangebound if new buyers fail to enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has recorded low demand for its spot ETFs. Data from CryptoQuant shows that since these ETFs launched in July, they have recorded $849M in outflows. Source: CryptoQuant The outflows have been spurred by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The ETFs are also struggling with a lack of new inflows. The BlackRock spot ETH ETF has posted zero inflows in the last two days. At the same time, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund has not seen any positive flows this month according to SoSoValue. This weak demand has failed to drive gains for Ethereum, which has further contributed to a decline in dominance. Ethereum is also struggling with a declining burn rate as the coin turns inflationary. Data from Ultrasound Money shows that in the last 30 days, more than 43,000 ETH tokens were added to the circulating supply. Data from Santiment shows that Ethereum’s annual inflation rate recently reached 18%, the highest level since August. Source: Santiment Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The lack of fresh demand to absorb this rising supply is bound to increase sell-side pressure on Ethereum causing it to lose its market share to Bitcoin and other altcoins. Ethereum’s falling dominance has also contributed to weakening market sentiment. Per Market Prophit, most traders are bearish on Ethereum while smart money or institutions remain bullish.

Title: Teenager had fingers broken during assault by group of youths in south Dublin, court hears

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A GROUP OF youths who broke a teenager’s fingers in south county Dublin told him not to mess with lads from their school again, a court has heard. One of the group of perpetrators, Luke Daly (23), has had his sentence deferred after he pleaded guilty to simple assault at Rock Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 7 December 2019. Daly, of Booterstown Avenue, Booterstown, Co Dublin, was one of ten or 20 youths who set upon the victim in what a judge said “may have been a case of mistaken identity”. Daly admitted grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him to the ground, however, gardaí could not say that he had any role in kicking or hitting. The victim suffered three fractured fingers when he was kicked by some of the youths as he went to get the DART home after attending a house party. At Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, Daly was ordered to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pending sentence next April. Judge Orla Crowe said the offence would warrant a sentence of two months, but that she intended to dispose of the case under Section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act. Daly was also ordered to pay the victim the sum of €3,000, which he had offered as a token of his remorse. Judge Crowe said the victim in the case was “entirely innocent and blameless” and simply should not have been subject to attack. Garda Eoin O’Mahony told Alison Fynes BL, prosecuting, that the victim went to a house party in Booterstown on the night, then left with some friends and his girlfriend to go to Domino’s Pizza. The victim told gardaí that shortly after 11pm, he was walking his girlfriend and two other friends towards the DART station, when he saw a group of ten or 20 lads walking behind them. Some of the group grabbed his friend, saying: “Can we have a chat?” and then pulled him to the ground. The victim said he ran to help his friend and then a lad ran after him, pulled him to the ground and a group began kicking him in the ribs. He asked them were they done and they replied: “Don’t mess with lads from (a particular school).” The victim’s friends gave similar statements, describing the large group as saying “You won’t mess with (a named school) again.” Advertisement The court heard there had been an altercation earlier on at a house party which did not involve either the victim or his friends. Daly was arrested and admitted to grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him down. He told gardaí pushes were exchanged and that the victim was on the ground when he left. The court heard that the large group of males had incorrectly assumed that the victim and his friend were part of a rival school. Daly had just turned 18 at the time, while the rest of the group of perpetrators were all underage. One of the other members of the group was assigned a Garda Junior Liaison Officer but no-one else was identified or prosecuted. The victim did not wish to attend court or make a victim impact statement, the court heard. Daly pleaded early at the District Court to the charge of simple assault, but the court referred the matter to the Circuit Court. Daly has no previous convictions and has not come to garda attention since, the court heard. Kevin Roche BL, defending, said it was an extremely childish incident which got out of control and was entirely out-of-character for his client. Counsel said this case has hung over Daly throughout his undergraduate degree and the Master’s degree he is currently doing. Daly, whose parents were present in court, was described as pro-social. The court heard that Daly has been putting money aside from part-time work and had brought the sum of €3,000 to court by way of compensation. Judge Crowe said it had been a “grave misunderstanding” and may have been a case of mistaken identity. The judge noted the large number of testimonials on Daly’s behalf and described him as a person of considerable academic and musical talent. “He has not come to any adverse attention since and has devoted his life to study. This was manifestly out-of-character. Gardaí have no concerns about this man,” added the judge. Daly is due back before court on 10 March 2025 for mention and final orders will be made on 10 April, when the case will be disposed of, if Daly has met all conditions.

This is the August 29th issue of the ForbesBLK newsletter, dedicated to elevating and empowering the world’s top Black entrepreneurs, leaders and investors. Delivered every Thursday straight to your inbox, it’s a must-read for those looking to stay inspired. Click here to get on the newsletter list! Hey ForbesBLK, Ayisha Mendez here. Did you know that Black women are the fastest growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the United States? Out of the 2.7 million businesses nationwide, 61% are self-funded, according to the Harvard Business Review. This is largely due to the lack of access to capital, exacerbated by the fact that less than 1% of venture capital dollars go to female founders. One ForbesBLK community member taking this head on is Genever Oppong, a private equity associate at BlackRock. She has witnessed firsthand the transformative effects of directing capital toward under-resourced communities of color. And emphasized that, “Together, we can shine a spotlight on the intersection of capital and community, showcasing how strategic investments in Black founders and investors can lead to transformative outcomes.” For Black Business Month, we did just that by joining forces with Genever’s network of Black Women Investors (BWI) and Tonna Obaze from Tonna&Co, for the State of Capital event aimed at providing strategies to access capital. This gathering brought together Black founders and funders to demystify venture capital and discuss equitable pathways to funding. During the event, panelist Stephany Ohaz, a Nigerian-American Investor whose pursuit of “finance for good” led her to impact investing, shared insights on how capital can be used as an agent of change. One of those impact recipients is Abena Boamah-Acheampong, founder of Hanahana Beauty, known as the, “Skincare Entrepreneur (Who) Is Giving Her Customers Equity In The Brand.” Her advice for those seeking capital is to, “look for people who have aligned incentives with you” and to prioritize building a supportive community – not just within your consumer base but also among those who can foster your growth. State of Black Capital by Marvin Lloyd “It’s also possible that VC funding is not the right fit for your business... and that’s OK,” explained Wilglory Tanjong, founder Amina Iris, known for its “Beyonce-approved” bags. During a live workshop led by Atlanta entrepreneur and local advisor, Yaminah Childress, members explored alternative ways to secure capital through the grant writing process. Events like this highlight the vital role community, training and networking play in fostering financial empowerment and establishing strategies for advancing capital.

Billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises is in talks with institutional investors, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG to raise $2 billion through a qualified institutional placement (QIP), Moneycontrol reported on Wednesday, October 9, citing people aware of the development. The potential institutional share sale is expected to be launched before the end of October, according to the sources cited by the news portal. Adani Enterprises shares ended 0.42 per cent lower at ₹3,152.90 on Wednesday, compared to the previous close of ₹3,166.15. “Adani Enterprises is in talks with a dozen institutional investors, including ADIA, QIA and GQG, which have backed Adani group companies in the recent past. The QIP will be launched once they have firm commitments from these institutional investors,” said a person aware of the development, as per the report. The news portal's emails to the Adani Group remained unanswered, while the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority refused to comment on the development. According to the report, queries sent to the Qatar Investment Authority and GQG also remained unanswered. The funds raised through the QIP issue are planned to be used for the company's capital expenditure and to repay some debt of the company and its subsidiaries, according to the report. On May 28, the Adani Enterprises board approved plans to raise nearly ₹16,600 crore through a QIP issue. Adani conglomerate's Adani Energy Solutions also raised nearly $1 billion through QIP, subscribed almost six times, according to the report. GQG, Blackrock, Nomura, ADIA, QIA and a bunch of domestic mutual funds, such as SBI MF, HDFC MF and Tata MF, participated in the QIP issue, according to the news portal. The news portal reported on September 5 that Adani Group plans to raise between ₹30,000 crore and ₹40,000 crore from retail investors through a non-convertible debentures (NCD) issue over the next three to four years to diversify funding sources and mitigate risk. The company's total debt increased to ₹50,124 crore in the financial year 2024, compared to ₹38,320 crore in the previous year. Adani Enterprises' long-term borrowing increased to ₹43,718 crore in the financial year 2024, compared to its levels of ₹32,590 crore in the previous year. The external debt was ₹29,511 crore in FY 2024, up from ₹22,237 crore in the previous year showing increased leverage and improved liquidity, as per the report.

Title: Hedera Analyst Thinks HBAR Will Easily 30X After Sinking 70% In 6 Months

Hedera, a proof-of-stake platform, wasn’t spared from aggressive bears in early October. After HBAR, its native token, floated higher in September, the rejection of bulls in early October resulted in a double top. Overall, there is optimism that bulls will resume and push prices to new Q4 2024 highs. The pace of this growth will depend on how the market performs and whether fundamental factors around the project will prop up buyers. While there are cracks in the HBAR price action, considering the dump from April highs of around $0.18, one analyst on X thinks the token is set for major gains. From his assessment, Hedera can easily score 30X in the coming sessions, mirroring the gains posted by Cardano in the last cycle. Then, ADA soared by over 170X. If HBAR is to follow the same path, the token can easily soar to $6, over 60X from its 2024 highs. Presently, technical candlestick arrangements favor sellers. After the rally to $0.18 in April 2024, HBAR has been falling. To put the numbers into perspective, the token is down 70% but is stable after finding support in August and September. The local resistance is the double top at around September highs. If prices break above this liquidation zone, HBAR bulls could embark on the journey to drive the coin to $0.18. In effect, this will resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. There are fundamental factors to consider that may propel HBAR, helping the token shake off weaknesses. Early this month, Canary Capital released the first United States HBAR Trust. Like Grayscale products, including the ETHE and GBTC, the HBAR Trust allows institutional investors to gain exposure to HBAR. Accordingly, this could drive demand, lifting prices. In September, Hedera launched the Asset Tokenization studio. Through this solution, the network would be at the forefront of driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) while adhering to existing laws. Already, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, believes tokenization will rapidly grow in the coming years, managing trillions. According to rwa.xyz, over $12.7 billion worth of RWAs has been tokenized. Additionally, there is interest. In the last month alone, the number of RWA holders rose to 68,929, a 4% increase. Most of these assets are tokenized on Ethereum and Stellar. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, said there’s been a surge in active Bitcoin addresses—up by 39% over the past week. That signals increased demand and liquidity, he said. Otychenko also noted a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM). NVM measures the relationship between Bitcoin's market value and the activity on its network, indicating potential under- or overvaluation. And now, the Bitcoin NVM is at levels not seen since its all-time high—suggesting the cryptocurrency could be trading below its intrinsic value. "Historically, when active addresses surge like this, it often precedes or accompanies price increases," Otychenko told Decrypt. The NVM metric has been a reliable indicator in the past, as it did in late 2022 and September 2023, when BTC saw price recoveries following similar drops in NVM, he added. Currently, Bitcoin is trading down 0.6% at $62,120, struggling to maintain levels above key technical indicators. It remains sandwiched between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA, a situation that mirrors price action from October 2023. For the cryptocurrency to break out of this consolidation, a move above the 200-day SMA with higher trading volume is essential. "Bitcoin needs to push above the 200-day SMA and sustain those levels to see further upward momentum," Otychenko said. However, the gains over the past week have come with decreasing volume, suggesting a lack of strong bullish momentum. On a broader level, analysts like Brian Dixon, CEO of OTC Capital, are rethinking Bitcoin’s traditional characterization as a purely risk-on asset. "Recent analyses, including from major financial institutions like BlackRock, are challenging the view of Bitcoin as only a risk asset," Dixon told Decrypt. He highlighted the evolving narrative of BTC behaving more like gold during economic downturns, pointing to its potential role as a risk-differentiated or even risk-off asset. This shift could redefine Bitcoin’s position in investment portfolios, making it a more attractive option for long-term diversification. "Bitcoin might offer protection against market volatility in ways that traditional assets might not," Dixon added, furthering the case for its adoption as a hedge against traditional market downturns. In terms of institutional flows, Bitcoin ETFs have seen mixed results. On Tuesday, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $18.6 million, with the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) leading the outflows at $48.8 million. However, the BlackRock ETF (IBIT) saw an inflow of $39.5 million on the same day. Spot ETFs that track Ethereum, which has remained relatively stable, saw a total net outflow of $8.1 million from spot ETFs on October 8, data from SoSo Value shows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price BTC was trading down 0.6% at $62,050 and Ether is trading flat at $2,432, according to data from CoinGecko. BTC's immediate price action remains contingent on upcoming macroeconomic data. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, noted that the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data could serve as triggers for Bitcoin’s next move. "Potential triggers to break out of this range could be Fed minutes or U.S. inflation data if they lead to a reassessment of expectations in traditional markets," Kuptsikevich said, in a note to Decrypt.

Title: The 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover 11 Best States to Retire and Offset this Gap

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2024 7:58:39 AM PDT by Red Badger This article looks at the 2025 Social Security COLA falls short: discover 11 best states to retire and offset the gap. You may skip our detailed analysis and jump to 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover the 5 Best States to Retire and Offset the Gap. 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4.

Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite.

The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to.

Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons.

Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11.

South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination.

Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10.

Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US.

Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area.

Title: Live Around the Planet: Wednesday October 9th

by Mark Steyn Clubland Q&A October 9, 2024 https://www.steynonline.com/14692/live-around-the-planet-wednesday-october-9th Thank you for all your questions. If you missed the live broadcast, the action replay can be heard in full here. UPPERDATE! We're live now, so let's have at it! UPDATE! We'll be going live in about fifteen minutes, so do get ready to fire off your questions via the comment form below. See you at the top of the hour. And to listen simply click the livestream feed. Yes, it's me! Mark Steyn of that ilk - back in the saddle for another hour of questions from Steyn Clubbers around the planet. Our Clubland Q&A starts live at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm British Summer Time/9pm Central European. If you chance to be elsewhere, do check local listings below. As we go to air, Hurricane Milton - the world's strongest this year - is barreling down on Florida, a mere fortnight after Hurricane Helene. We hope our many Club members in the Sunshine State, and others in the path of this storm, will stay safe. Six million Floridians have been ordered to evacuate. America is four weeks from its laughably misnamed "Election Day", so there are political implications to meteorological phenomena in swing states. I'm happy to discuss those or anything else on your mind, but I am particularly mindful of the callousness of our age. I'm thinking not just of bigfoot media's indifference to the suffering in Appalachia, but of a thousand smaller, daily tragedies. Last Thursday, for example, Dr Jackie Stone became the latest Covid contrarian to be driven to kill herself: On 3 October @DrJackieStone took her own life. Everything she valued and found purpose in was taken from her. If you don't know by now, this is how it works if you speak up against The Narrative. Here is an extract from her final interview. 🎥Me and @woodybaloo... pic.twitter.com/RiTmLXT02I I cannot claim to have known Dr Stone except through the Internet - she followed me on Twitter after we began telling the stories of vaccine victims on The Mark Steyn Show. I knew that she had developed an effective protocol for treating Covid that included Ivermectin - she practised in Zimbabwe, where, strange though it may sound to American and European ears, the government was rather less deranged in the Covid years than that of, say, Minnesota or France. Nevertheless, because Dr Stone's treatment was insufficient of a cash cow for Big Pharma and the public health agencies they have corrupted, she was targeted and, as noted above, lost everything in her life. After hosting a health summit with other dissident doctors at Victoria Falls just over two months ago, she fell into despair and joined the lengthening list of those around the world so comprehensively punished for their dissent that there was nothing left but suicide. You may be over Covid but Covid isn't over you - because it's the template for your future. The evil men who imposed the lockdown/vaccine regime on you will do it all over again next time - even though, as we now know, they went to "drug-fueled sex parties" while a generation of kids was psychologically kiboshed and women's fertility nosedived across the west. The "conventional wisdom" is now literally killing us - and yet, as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry have recently assured us, in the future they're building any objection to it will not be tolerated. On today's Clubland Q&A I'm happy to entertain your thoughts on that, or on anything else you want to raise. Whether or not you're a member of The Mark Steyn Club, you can listen to our show live as it happens wherever you chance to be on this turbulent earth: Club membership is required only to ask a question. We love to hear from brand new members, and especially appreciate those who are having such a great time in these parts that they've signed up a chum for a Steyn Club Gift Membership. Among the additions to our ranks in recent days are newbies from around the globe - from Belfast to Bigfork, from Tokoroa to Thief River Falls, from London, Ontario to Latham in the Australian Capital Territory. Whether you've joined this week either for a full year or a see-how-it-goes experimental quarter, do shoot me a head-scratcher for today's show. But, if you're not interested in joining, no worries, as they say in Oz: We seek no unwilling members - and as always the show is free to listen to, so we hope you'll want to tune in. So see you back here at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm in London, 9pm in Paris, 10pm in Jerusalem; half-past-ten in Teheran; midnight-forty-five in Kathmandu; 3am in Singapore and Honkers (sorry about that); 5am in Sydney and Melbourne; 7am in Auckland, and a rather more convivial hour for the kippers and kedgeree in His Majesty's Dominions eastward across the Pacific, where you're so far ahead I've probably already lost my appeal by now...

Our first visit to America has been a 4000 mile bus trip from New York to Miami via New Hampshire, Quebec, Niagara, Washington, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando and countless other places we've heard of in songs and stories. Its an amazing country for sure. So green, and so much water! I know we only see a tiny slice of the real America on a trip like this but I've been struck by the lack of political signage for either side. I thought we would see blue and red posters everywhere but we've barely seen a hint that theres an election looming. Is this an indication of indifference to the direction America is heading, or are we just not travelling in the right places? Regards, David.

Well, she had a far more detailed answer than any daughter would expect from a father, bringing in the wealth creating video poetry which included Rudyard Kipling's "Gods of the Copybook Headings". The term all made far more sense to me than it previously had â a term I had used without ever thinking about it. Thanks for the education.Polls in the US seem to be tightening. I listened to a podcast with Victor Davis Hanson being interviewed who expressed confidence that Kamala would win the popular vote for reasons well known to you, but not the electoral college. My question is if that is the case, what damage can the democrats do in the peaceful 60 day transfer of power? Or would you expect them to behave well?Keep well.

Title: Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan

October 09, 2024 09:55 ET | Source: Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”)LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan Alliance Witan PLC (“Alliance Witan” or the “Company”) announces that its investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), has appointed Jennison Associates (“Jennison”) as an additional stock picker for its multi-manager global equity portfolio, taking the total number of stock pickers to eleven. New York and Boston-based Jennison was founded in 1969. It has $210 billion of assets under management (as of 30 June 2024) and specialises in investing in companies with exceptional growth prospects. Jennison previously managed part of the multi-manager global equity portfolio of Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) before the latter’s combination with Alliance Trust plc to create Alliance Witan (the “Combination”), which completed on 9 October. Jennison’s allocation of approximately 5% of the Company’s portfolio has been largely filled from a subset of the stocks which it managed within Witan. Most of the balance of Witan’s portfolio transferred pursuant to the Combination has been handed to BlackRock, which is acting as transition manager, for realignment. However, with two managers in common between Alliance Trust and Witan – Veritas Asset Management and GQG Partners – there have also been some other in specie transfers of stock which will be retained. The overall risk profile of the Alliance Witan portfolio will remain largely unchanged from that of the Alliance Trust portfolio before the Combination, reflecting the continuation of the distinctive multi-manager approach previously employed. There will be no major regional, style or sectoral biases relative to the market, with most of the added value designed to come from stock picking. Details of allocations by manager will be available in the next factsheet. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “Jennison has long been one of our highest-rated managers and will diversify our exposure to growth stocks. The combination with Witan gives us the opportunity to transfer them in largely in-specie, hence with relatively low transaction costs.” 9 October 2024

Title: TCPC stock touches 52-week low at $8.03 amid market challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/tcpc-stock-touches-52week-low-at-803-amid-market-challenges-93CH-3655721

Full Content:
In a turbulent market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, dipping to $8.03. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -26.42% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring TCPC as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its performance and valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the company's short-term outlook and potential strategic adjustments moving forward. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has announced a series of leadership changes. Rajneesh Vig will step down from his roles as Chairman and CEO but will remain on the Board of Directors until January 31, 2025. Phil Tseng will take over as Chairman and CEO, and Jason Mehring will assume the role of President. Patrick Wolfe has been appointed the new COO, and Dan Worrell will join Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. The company also reported notable financial achievements. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, resulting in an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. The Q2 2024 earnings report disclosed an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of about 14%. A third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share was declared, indicating a strong financial position. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a smooth transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent dip to a 52-week low aligns with several key insights from InvestingPro. The stock's volatility and recent price decline are reflected in InvestingPro data, which shows a 22.62% price drop over the last three months. This downward trend is further emphasized by the stock trading at just 66.09% of its 52-week high. Despite these challenges, TCPC maintains a significant dividend yield of 24.16%, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that TCPC has maintained dividend payments for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns even in difficult times. However, the company's financial health presents a mixed picture. While TCPC's revenue grew by 16.64% over the last twelve months, reaching $232.32 million, an InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company was not profitable during this period. This aligns with the negative P/E ratio of -11.32 and the diluted EPS of -$0.71. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 5 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into TCPC's financial situation and future prospects.

Title: Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here

According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin (BTC) price appreciation in 2024 failed to compensate for its price volatility risks. Meanwhile, gold’s higher risk-adjusted returns reaffirmed its “safe haven” narrative. The leading digital asset by reported market cap surged from roughly $42,000 at the beginning of the year to as high as $73,000 in March 2024, recording more than 73% gains. At its current market price of $62,790, BTC is still more than 40% up from its price in January 2024. Notably, throughout 2024, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed major equity indices, fixed-income instruments, gold, and crude oil. However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, despite BTC’s impressive gains, its price performance in absolute terms fails to compensate for its volatility. The analysis by Goldman Sachs puts BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) volatility ratio at just under 2%. In comparison, gold gave a risk-adjusted return of 3%, posting strong 28% gains in absolute terms. For the uninitiated, the volatility ratio measures the return an asset generates for each unit of risk or volatility it carries. A higher ratio indicates that an asset provides better returns relative to the risk taken, while a lower ratio suggests less efficient performance. The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio was only better than Ethereum’s native ETH token, S&P GSCI Energy Index, and Japan’s TOPIX index among the non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments. Bitcoin’s low volatility ratio compared to gold cements the latter’s claim as a “safe haven asset.” This came under the limelight last week when BTC slumped, and gold surged following Iran’s offensive against Israel. Since its inception following the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s ascent to a trillion-dollar market cap asset has been remarkable. The fixed supply of 21 million, decentralized network architecture, and halving every four years make BTC an appealing asset. However, the market cap gap between Bitcoin and gold remains vast. That said, several crypto analysts are confident that Bitcoin will outperform the shining metal in the coming years. For instance, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt recently made an ambitious prediction that by 2025, BTC could see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Similarly, in August 2024, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that BTC could surge to $350,000 on the back of greater adoption. Most recently, investment management firm BlackRock declared Bitcoin a “gold alternative” due to its fixed supply and increasing investor confidence in its ability to tackle inflation and avoid value erosion during uncertain times. On the contrary, billionaire Ray Dalio has expressed his opinion on the Bitcoin vs. gold narrative, saying that BTC will never fully replace gold. BTC trades at $62,790 at press time, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

Title: MGE Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGEE) institutional investors lost 3.2% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mge-energy-inc-nasdaq-mgee-102311006.html

Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Title: China markets plunge on Beijing stimulus disappointment

Shares in mainland China plunged as traders expressed their disappointment with the lack of new stimulus. The U.S. government’s possible attempt to break up Google weighed on tech. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai plunges over stimulus sadness A day after Hong Kong’s Hang Sang Index posted its steepest one-day plunge since 2008, China mainland shares took their own steep dive. Shanghai’s SSE Composite dropped 6.62% while Hong Kong gave up another 1.38% as investors again voted against Beijing’s Tuesday explanation of its stimulus plans—which offered few details and no new big measures. China’s finance minister will give another briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei rises as 7-Eleven owner shares rise on higher bid The Nikkei 225 rose 0.87%, buoyed by shares in retailer Seven & i Holdings, which soared as much as 11.7% before closing up 4.71% after Bloomberg reported that Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard had increased its takeover bid by about 20%. Tech shares also rose, as new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament in advance of Oct. 27 snap elections in which he hopes to consolidate power. Europe: Shares waver as fading China optimism and Rio Tinto deal dampen upswing European stocks rose slightly early Wednesday, as fading China optimism softened a general upswing. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.50% in early trading with broad-based rises, tempered by a drop in Rio Tinto shares on the announcement it was buying Arcadium Lithium for $6.7 billion. The STOXX Europe 600 was up a marginal 0.18%. U.S. premarket slips with Boeing and Google news A day after all three rose, the main U.S. indexes were all down in premarket trading Wednesday, as Boeing’s withdrawal of its pay offer to its striking machinists trimmed 0.8% from its shares, and the announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet. The possible DOJ action weighed on tech more broadly, a day after the group of tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven all rose, with the largest gain going to Nvidia, up 4.1% Tuesday. And earnings season is here: Delta Air Lines reports on Thursday, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. CPI data for September will also be released before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was announced by a prominent crypto personality as the most donated meme coin as these type of coins continue to grow in importance for charitable causes. This kind of recognition shows how these digital assets can benefit communities and gain business traction. Meme coin projects have earned praise from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for donating a percentage of their token supply to charity. He thanked the projects and efforts dedicated to this cause in a post on X. Some “meme coins” were used as examples, including “ebull,” among well-known cryptocurrencies contributing to various charities. I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity. (eg. I saw ebull sent a bunch to various groups last month) Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 7, 2024 Based on comments made by Buterin, Shiba Inu community members have claimed that among meme coins, SHIB leads in charity gifts. According to crypto expert Del Crxpto, no other meme coin can even emulate Shiba Inu’s level of philanthropy. For example, several donations, including to the recent Seungil Hope Foundation in Seoul, Korea which supports the country’s first specialized ALS hospital, reflect this growing dedication to giving. $SHIB is #1 in this regard… No one else comes close. https://t.co/PgnMvn8PYx — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) October 7, 2024 In related news, with good breakout and backtest signs in the very vibrant meme coin space, technical analyst Charting Guy has predicted a possible price spike for Shiba Inu.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: The Corporate Transparency Act â The most aggressive domestic spying program since the Patriot Act

(Article by Peter McIlvenna republished from TheGatewayPundit.com) These words reflected the general and growing distrust of the government. Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ.

My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day.

Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name.

Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021.

The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury.

Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella.

Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business.

CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act.
