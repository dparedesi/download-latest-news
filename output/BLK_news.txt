Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Positioned for Growth in Gen-AI Training, Bernstein Analysts Highlight Inference Challenges for Competitors

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Benetton the fashionable standard bearers of Italy’s rugby renaissance
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/05/benetton-the-fashionable-standard-bearers-of-italys-rugby-renaissance/
Time Published: 2024-10-05T05:00:00Z

Whisper it quietly, but Italian rugby genuinely appears to be on the up. Last season the Azzurri had its best Six Nations in terms of results, with two wins and a draw, and although their Under-20s were patchy, they won two Six Nations matches for the third campaign in a row, including a first ever win over their French counterparts. As usual Benetton were bulk suppliers to both, yet also had their best season since joining the Celtic League in 2010. Only twice in the ensuing 14 seasons have Benetton won more matches than they’ve lost, firstly in 2017-18 and again in 2018-19 when reaching the playoffs for the first time before losing 15-13 against Munster in Thomond Park. But by any metric, their achievement in finishing seventh in the URC last season was better, not only because they won a higher percentage of matches, 11 out of 18, with one draw, but because since the expansion to include the four South African Super Rugby powerhouses this is just a more competitive competition than in its previous iterations. What’s more, in securing automatic qualification on merit for this season’s Champions Cup, Benetton reached the quarter-finals of the URC and were pushing hard to force their quarter-final against the Bulls into extra-time before going down 30-23. There were also five more wins in their run to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup. “Yeah, for sure, it was a very good season,” agrees Antonio Pavanello, who was a back five forward for a decade with Benetton and has been their general manager since 2015. “We achieved the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup away to Gloucester, but unfortunately we didn’t play well. We were, perhaps, a little too nervous and that was a shame, but we also finished seventh in the URC and we achieved the quarter-finals, and in a stronger competition than the past. “So this quarter-final was at another level compared to 2019 and honestly we played a very good match. Everybody said we would be beaten well by the Bulls so we entered onto the field without stress and it was an opportunity to play good rugby.” Interestingly, while they scored five less tries last season compared to the season before (51 as against 56), Benetton were way more resolute defensively, conceding 18 fewer tries with 56 compared to 74 two seasons ago. “Calum MacRae, our defence coach, has done a very good job,” says Pavanello of the former Scottish Sevens player and head coach, who joined two seasons ago after five seasons as defence coach at Edinburgh. “So that is the result of the focus on that area. “He has done a very, very good job and on the other side we really improved in terms of physicality and so the improvement in that area is a result of the defence and winning more collisions. That was the main area we worked on and it was important to achieve those results.” Benetton also supplied 19 players to the Azzurri in last season’s Six Nations, and even if this obliges them to invest in imported talent to offset this drain Pavanello maintains: “If we help Italy to win matches in the Six Nations we are proud to have done our job well.” With acquisitions such as Malakai Fekitoa from Munster to further swell their non-Italian contingent, it seems that Benetton now have the financial resources and independence to target a high URC finish like never before, although Pavanello says this is also due to changing perceptions. “Our (financial) balance is getting better and better, and we can spend a little bit more money, but for me what we have now compared to previous seasons is credibility. “So, when I try to get new players, it is a little bit easier because in the past they see an Italian club without too many results so even if you offered them good money, they go to other clubs. “Now, it is a little bit different. We have more credibility and players are attracted to coming here, so if you offer the same money they prefer to come to a good environment, in a good city and a good country, and with a club that is looking to achieve new goals.” But for Pavanello, the sea change he has witnessed is as much off the pitch as on it. “When I finished my (playing) career here, there were seven people on the staff, now there are 25, so we can give to the players more and more detail. The facilities are much better than in the past. I can see a club that is on the same level as other clubs around Europe. So, Benetton aren’t of a mind to leave last season as a one-off, although there are half a dozen teams who missed out on the top eight last season and are genuinely targeting the playoffs this season. “Our ambition is to repeat the URC playoffs but we know that it will be harder because first of all everybody is waiting for us and we will be back in the Champions Cup and we know that competition is really, really hard,” admits Pavanello ahead of Benetton facing Clermont (away), Bath (home), Bristol (away) and La Rochelle (home). “In the meantime to have 20 players with Italy and five with Argentina, which is not easy to manage. The Italian players have the November internationals and the Six Nations, and as well as the Rugby Championship the Argentinian players have November internationals, and that is the main issue this season.” “But I am confident that the staff will find the right turnover in a large squad and we’ll have the opportunity to keep the energy at the right time with individuals players. “If I watch the model to copy it is the Irish system and especially Leinster. I always watch their model and try to apply the same things to our system in our club and for that reason we improve a lot in the last few seasons. “I think that Irish rugby is a good environment. The Irish team is very strong and Leinster is one of the best clubs in the world.” Unlike Leinster, of course, there is no schools rugby in Italy. Benetton do not have conveyor belts like Blackrock and St Michael’s. But Treviso is one of the small hotbeds of rugby in Italy. “Consider that around Treviso there are 17 clubs. We don’t have schools where you have the chance to play rugby, the private clubs do that, and we have 17 in this area. So, in terms of the identity of rugby (in Italy) this is the most important area. “We are talking about a province of one million people and in Treviso there are 800,000 so to have 17 rugby clubs around here is very important.” Benetton have an under-18 academy managed by the FIR which works with the best players in their region, and also an under-22 academy managed by the FIR. Ultimately though, however huge Gaelic football and hurling are in Ireland, rugby still commands attention and eyes, whereas Italian rugby is dwarfed by calcio and according to the former Zebre coach Michael Bradley, languishes in 16th place in participation numbers. Pavanello admits football’s dominance commercial “is a big problem for our sport in Italy”. “We try to work a lot in communication, especially on social media and we continue to work hard because we believe we can improve year by year.” Still, you can’t help but think that rugby globally could do more, be it have a World Cup in Italy or a Champions Cup final there. “That would be a good starting point to change the view in Italy but also in other countries. For example, in 2031 the World Cup will be in the USA. That is a good chance to develop rugby there, but I hope also that in the future we will have the chance to host a World Cup. “We have more than 60 million population here and if rugby can improve in one country that is Italy and you don’t do that only with the Six Nations. As you say, you have the chance to do this with events like the Champions Cup final or a URC final, as well as a Rugby World Cup final. That is the direction rugby should take.” Ultimately though, Pavanello remains optimistic about the future of rugby in Benetton and in Italy generally. “We know that we will have one season that you can have three steps forward and maybe one season that you can do only one step forward because of the opportunities we have financially. Inside the URC and the Six Nations we are not the most important club or union but I am optimistic because I see that the pathway is right.” Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street gains as US jobs data eases economic worries

US stocks have closed higher as investors digested a labour report that indicated unemployment slipped last month. Photo / 123RF The Dow has posted a record closing high and the Nasdaq ended with a more than a 1% gain as a stronger-than-expected jobs report reassured investors who had worried the economy may be getting too weak. US job gains increased in September by the most in six months and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, the report showed. The data “basically tells us economic activity in the fourth quarter is likely to remain at a solid pace,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It’s a good surprise but I also think it may now slow the pace of rate cuts.” Traders further reduced bets on a 50-basis-point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s November 6-7 meeting. Traders are pricing in just an 8% chance of a 50-bps rate cut, down from about 31% earlier on Friday, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed. The Fed kicked off a monetary easing cycle last month with a 50 basis point rate cut. Small caps and financials outperformed, with the Russell 2000 index up 1.5% and the S&P 500 financials index up 1.6%. Spirit Airlines shares dropped 24.6% while other airlines jumped after a report showed Spirit was in talks with bondholders about a potential bankruptcy filing. Frontier Group shot up 16.4% while United Airlines rose 6.5% and Delta Air Lines climbed 3.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341.16 points, or 0.81%, to 42,352.75, the S&P 500 gained 51.13 points, or 0.90%, to 5751.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 219.37 points, or 1.22%, to 18,137.85. Indices registered just slight gains for the week following worries about increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Dow was up 0.1% while the S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq was up 0.1%. The S&P energy index rose 1.1% on the day along with higher oil prices. With the Middle East concerns, the index jumped 7.0% for the week in its biggest weekly percentage gain since October 2022. US President Joe Biden said that if he were in Israel’s shoes, he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran’s missile barrage this week. Rivian shares fell 3.2% after the electric vehicle startup cut its full-year production forecast and delivered fewer vehicles than expected in the third quarter. Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to unofficially begin next week. Major financial firms highlight next week’s reports, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and BlackRock due on October 11. Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20.6% for the year so far. US ports on the east and Gulf coasts reopened but clearing the cargo backlog will likely take time. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 91 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 10.91 billion shares compared with the 12.03 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Paula Ryan has faced some major setbacks in her career but still comes up smiling.

Rachel Lord, Head of International for BlackRock said, ““We are excited by the opportunity to deliver affordable and innovative investment solutions to millions of people in India. With our partner Jio Financial Services, we want to contribute to the country’s evolution from a nation of savers to a nation of investors.

Title: 1600 jobs slashed as ‘green revolution’ stalls at Northvolt
URL: https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/motoring-news/1600-jobs-slashed-as-green-revolution-stalls-at-northvolt/news-story/5d50ac9d945dcf67ccc7e00bdcf2c056
Time Published: 2024-10-05T00:54:08Z
Full Content:
A major company was supposed to spark a “green revolution” and wean the world off oil and Chinese imports, but it is not going to plan. Things can change an awful lot in just three years. Back in 2021, the opening of a giga factory in an icy city near the Arctic Circle was hailed as the starting point of a “green industrial revolution” that would change the world. The factory was opened by an exciting and rapidly-expanding business called Northvolt that had a mission to build “the world’s greenest battery” to power electric vehicles. Sweden’s then prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said the opening of Northvolt’s base in Skelleftea held huge significance in the transition away from oil and imported batteries from China — not just for Europe, but for the world. His optimism did not seem misplaced at the time. Northvolt had attracted billions of dollars of investment from Wall St giants like Goldman Sachs and Blackrock and orders from the world’s biggest car companies including Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo. But, in more recent times a far more sobering reality has emerged. Last week, the beleaguered electric car battery maker revealed it would cut a quarter of its staff, as it struggles with strained finances and a slowdown in demand. The brutal cuts in Sweden come as electric car sales slump in Europe and the continent lags far behind China in battery production. The company employs 6,500 people, according to its website. A staggering 1,600 of those will lose their jobs. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s boss, has blamed “headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate” for the difficult decisions. “While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time,” he said in a statement. He added that Northvolt needed to “focus all energy and investments into our core business.” It comes as global car companies, including Northvolt’s biggest investor, Volkswagen, have had a tough time selling EVs, with some posting losses from their electric divisions. A major problem for Northvolt is that as demand for EVs has softened, the demand for the cells that power them has followed suit. Even the most well-established battery-makers like South Korea’s SK On and LG Energy Solution have seen profits take a big hit — and the Swedish company has fared even worse. Northvolt lost $1.74 billion last year — that’s four times its loss in 2022. Calls to rethink petrol-powered car ban timeline Northvolt’s problems could become even more concerning given the bleak situation for the European EV market right now. Last week, the European auto industry called for “urgent relief measures” as electric car sales plummet in the region. It said there was a “continual downward trajectory” in EV sales. New-car registration data reveals European electric vehicle sales fell 45 per cent in August 2024 with 92,627 sales, compared to 165,204 at the same time in 2023, while the market share for battery-electric vehicles has fallen from 21 per cent to 14.4 per cent. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said the fall was driven by Germany and France, the largest new-car markets in the European Union. In Germany, electric vehicle sales dropped a massive 68.8 per cent in August compared to the same time in 2023, while France dropped 33.1 per cent. The situation is so dire that the ACEA called on the EU to rethink its timeline for banning petrol-powered cars — currently slated for 2035. It said while carmakers have supported the transition to electrified vehicles, “the other necessary elements of this systemic shift are not in place”. “We are missing crucial conditions to reach the necessary boost in production and adoption of zero-emission vehicles: charging and hydrogen refilling infrastructure, as well as a competitive manufacturing environment, affordable green energy, purchase and tax incentives, and a secure supply of raw materials, hydrogen and batteries,” said the ACEA board. “Economic growth, consumer acceptance, and trust in infrastructure have not developed sufficiently either.” Self-inflicted pain Although the market is faltering, Northvolt’s biggest issue is self-inflicted according to The Economist. It reported the company had a pot of funding worth $22 billion last year which it spent “far and wide” in projects like developing a sodium-ion cell battery and working on wood-based batteries with a paper company. Northvolt said it was spending on average $434 million a month with the aim of becoming a vertically integrated European battery giant with intensive manufacturing sites in Canada, Germany, Poland and Sweden. However, it lost sight of its core money-making purpose of making EV batteries on time for its big clients like BMW — which spectacularly pulled the plug on a $3 billion order of cells in May because of delays. Major job cuts Northvolt, which previously warned that cuts were coming, said that following “initial steps” of a strategic review it estimated that proposed cost-saving measures would result in about 1,000 redundancies at its primary Skelleftea plant — where an expansion project would be suspended. The company had intended to expand the capacity of the facility to provide an annual output of 30 GWh, but will now focus on ramping up to 16 GWh. In July, it said it hoped to reach an annual production of over one GWh this year — still far from the facility’s capacity. One GWh is enough to equip 20,000 average sized cars. “Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations,” Carlsson said in a statement. Another 400 positions would be cut in the city of Vasteras and 200 in the Swedish capital Stockholm. “The rescoping of operations is critical to ensure a sustainable operation and cost base,” Northvolt said. It added that “to achieve this a workforce reduction of approximately 20 per cent at a global level, and 25 per cent in Sweden is required”. Falling behind to China Northvolt has been seen as a cornerstone of European attempts to catch up with China and the United States in the production of battery cells, a crucial component of lower-emission cars. Europe accounts for just three per cent of global battery cell production, but has set its sights on 25 per cent of the market by the end of the decade. Northvolt still reports to have contracts worth $80 billion with customers such as Scania, Volvo and Volkswagen. Volkswagen is also Northvolt’s largest shareholder, with a 21 per cent stake. Production delays and lower demand from automotive customers have led to a rapidly deteriorating financial situation, which accelerated at the end of the summer, according to the business daily Dagens Industri. According to Swedish media reports, Northvolt is trying to organise a new share issue to raise 7.5 billion kronor ($1 billion). The battery maker has also faced scrutiny in Sweden over concerns about work safety at its sites, with Swedish police currently investigating a number of unexplained deaths of factory workers, who died after working at the plant in Skelleftea. In mid-September, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that “there are no plans for the Swedish state to become a part owner of Northvolt or anything like that”. Since its creation, the Swedish company has secured $22 billion of credit and capital. As it looks out on a rocky landscape, it will have to choose how to spend that money very wisely. — with AFP To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

He also noted the stocks rally on Friday as Wall Street celebrated better-than-expected job creation last month. "A market that appreciates good news, like a robust job creation number, is a market that can handle, well, let's just say, the historically tough month of October," he said. "After today's performance, all I can say is so far so good." Tuesday brings earnings from PepsiCo and an investor day from General Motors. Cramer noted that there have been some price target cuts for the beverage company, but suggested that the stock could "stabilize on somewhat in-line results." Meanwhile, General Motors stock could go higher if the company maintains its forecast, according to Cramer, adding that it has had a solid year. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will release notes from its most recent meeting, and Cramer said they could shed light on the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points. Wall Street, he said, continues to speculate about the Federal Reserve's next move, adding that opinions are mixed, especially after Friday's strong labor data. The labor department will release September's CPI report on Thursday, and Cramer said investors who want a rate cut are hoping for a cool number. Thursday also brings earnings from Domino's and Delta. The pizza maker's last quarter was disappointing in part due to weak business overseas, Cramer said, adding that analysts are mixed about how this report will shake out. And while Cramer said he's wary of airline stocks, he suspects Delta will tell "a good story." Cramer pointed to three Big Tech events on Thursday: Tesla will unveil its robotaxi, and both AMD and HP Enterprise will hold analyst days. He anticipates Tesla's autonomous vehicles will be well-received by investors. AMD's "Advancing AI" event could show the company in a new light, Cramer said, and he suggested the stock is a buy ahead of the meeting. HP's analyst day could be "a needle-mover," according to Cramer, as it's centered around its artificial intelligence efforts — which he said are "substantial and underestimated." Friday brings the producer price index report, and like the CPI, this data will be a metric for the Fed's next decision, Cramer said. Big ticket financial earnings will also come out that day, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Blackrock. He said banks represent the least expensive group on the market, and investors should use any weakness to buy them.

Title: AI’s energy appetite too big for Texas grid, regulators warn

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/04/2024 3:45:57 PM PDT by nickcarraway Datacenters coming online in the next 15 months will need to supply at least some of their own powerUpdated As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas, but as datacenter footprints explode amid the AI boom, regulators fear even the Lone Star state's utilities won't be able to keep up for much longer. The Texas' Public Utility Commission is now warning datacenter operators looking to set up shop in the US state within the next 12 to 15 months that they won't be able to rely entirely on the local grid and will have to supply at least some of their own power. As some of you will know, Texas has at times suffered blackouts from demand overload, and outages sparked by storms damaging infrastructure. "We can't afford to lose any of our resources off the system at this point, especially given those load-growth projections," Thomas Gleeson, who chairs the commission, told Blomberg during the Gulf Coast Power Association conference in Austin this week. Chief among Gleeson's concerns is datacenters setting up shop near existing power plants and buying up the supply of electricity, making it harder for the grid to keep the lights on for everyone else. Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

AI systems, especially those like me, are running a bunch of these “games” at once. To understand and respond to your questions, it has to do lots of calculations, similar to how your brain works when solving math p1gaming console) and these use a ton of energy to run and stay cool. It’s kind of like how your laptop gets warm when it’s on for a long time, but on a much bigger scale. And this constant demand for energy is why AI systems are such energy hogs!

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Texas' Public Utility Commission is now warning datacenter operators looking to set up shop in the US state within the next 12 to 15 months that they won't be able to rely entirely on the local grid and will have to supply at least some of their own power. As some of you will know, Texas has at times suffered blackouts from demand overload, and outages sparked by storms damaging infrastructure. "We can't afford to lose any of our resources off the system at this point, especially given those load-growth projections," Thomas Gleeson, who chairs the commission, told Blomberg during the Gulf Coast Power Association conference in Austin this week. Chief among Gleeson's concerns is datacenters setting up shop near existing power plants and buying up the supply of electricity, making it harder for the grid to keep the lights on for everyone else. Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

Instead, Gleeson wants to see datacenter operators arranging and supporting their own generation facilities before putting strain on existing infrastructure. Gleeson's comments come as power becomes a chief concern among datacenter operators looking to expand AI compute infrastructure to new regions and larger clusters. Some of the AI-crunching clusters under development now exceed 125,000 GPUs and have power budgets measured in hundreds of megawatts. Last month, Oracle supremo Larry Ellison revealed his database giant's largest datacenter development was rated for 800 megawatts of capacity, and said next-gen facilities would consume more than a gigawatt. Sourcing power for these sites has become a prime concern for datacenter operators, and according to a recent CBRE report is already resulting in delays to datacenter builds. To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online. But, if Redmond is to be believed, the 170 megawatt power plant containing some 22 gas generators only supplies power during periods when the national grid is unable to keep up with demand. ® Updated to add at 2030 UTC, October 4 The US Department of Energy on Thursday announced it was pumping $1.5 billion into four transmission projects that should increase US grid capacity by 7.1GW, improve reliability, and hook Texas's isolated ERCOT grid into that national network.

To ensure their bit-barn projects don't run out of juice, some operators are cozying up to operating and even defunct nuclear power plants. This northern spring, Amazon paid $650 million for Talen Energy's Cumulus datacenter located directly adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under the deal, Amazon will have access to up to 960 megawatts of power. Similarly, Microsoft just signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to bring the 837 megawatt Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant back online following its retirement in 2019. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels."

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told Nikkei Asia that the search giant is also weighing the nuclear option. However, bringing retired nuclear plants back online isn't always as easy as it sounds. As The Register recently reported, many older facilities will require extensive repairs and modernization before they're ready to start turning steam into electricity again. Some operators hope to bypass the problems associated with legacy reactor designs by opting for small modular reactor designs from the likes of NuScale, Oklo, and others. During Oracle's Q1 earnings call last month, Ellison said the IT goliath had already secured building permits for a trio of SMRs. But while SMRs have promise, none are operating. NuScale, which is one of the first SMR vendors to get approval from US authorities to build the small reactors, planned to build a six-reactor plant in Utah capable of generating 462 megawatts of power. However, the development was later abandoned after several municipalities pulled out of the deal over rising costs. Some critics believe SMRs will never work. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicted the reactors will be "too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky to play a significant role in transitioning away from fossil fuels." Microsoft, BlackRock form fund to sink up to $100B into AI infrastructure Uncle Sam lends $1.5B to reignite Michigan nuclear plant in 2025 Microsoft cash to help reignite Three Mile Island atomic plant Datacenters bleed watts and cash – all because they're afraid to flip a switch It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now, it's far from the only option datacenter operators can consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives. AWS, for instance, briefly weighed using natural gas fuel cells to power some of its Oregon datacenters as an alternative to grid power, and ultimately abandoned the plan. In the energy-constrained Irish market, Microsoft is using natural gas to keep several of its datacenters online.

Full Content:
In a recent transaction, Christopher Accettella, Portfolio Manager at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), has made a notable purchase of the company's common stock. On January 11, 2024, Accettella acquired 1,190 shares at a price of $15.17 per share, amounting to a total investment of $18,052. This transaction reflects the Portfolio Manager's growing stake in the company, bringing Accettella's total holdings to 4,069.502 shares following the purchase. The acquisition, which took place directly, showcases a vote of confidence in the trust's future performance. Investors often monitor insider transactions such as these for insights into the perspectives of key executives and managers regarding their company's stock. Accettella's decision to increase his investment in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is likely to be interpreted as a positive signal about the company's prospects. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, trading under the ticker NYSE:BMEZ, is known for its focus on health sciences and related sectors. The trust's performance and the actions of its insiders are closely watched by investors interested in the healthcare investment space. The details of this transaction were made public through a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which documents the insider trading activities of the company's executives and other significant shareholders. Christopher Accettella's recent purchase of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) shares aligns with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, BMEZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.4%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BMEZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." The trust's market capitalization stands at $1.69 billion, with a P/E ratio of 25.31, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for its earnings. This valuation comes despite another InvestingPro Tip suggesting that BMEZ "suffers from weak gross profit margins." Investors should weigh these factors against the trust's impressive total return performance, which shows a 24.93% gain over the past year and a 15.87% return year-to-date. It's worth noting that BMEZ is currently trading at 95.72% of its 52-week high, with a previous closing price of $15.76. This proximity to its peak price could be influencing insider buying decisions, such as Accettella's recent purchase.

Dubbed the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF, the fund’s strategy entails periodically shifting exposure between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts and assets like U.S. Treasuries. Those changes are motivated by “a proprietary signal,” the firm said, which looks at several moving averages for cryptocurrency prices. The new fund will combine the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). The slated conversion follows Bitwise’s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF space alongside financial titans like BlackRock and Fidelity in January, following SEC approval. Currently, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF holds nearly 39,000 Bitcoin worth $2.3 billion, according to CoinGlass data. The fund takes a momentum-based approach toward investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. When Bitwise’s signal indicates that “prices are gaining momentum,” the fund gains crypto exposure, while seeking refuge in government debt when the opposite trend emerges. “Momentum is a well-established factor in virtually every asset class, and it is powerful in crypto as well,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said in a press release, adding that the new fund’s goal is to “help minimize downside volatility and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns.” Following the launch of its spot Ethereum ETF in July, Bitwise has continued to position itself as a purveyor of funds giving investors access to crypto through traditional brokerage accounts. Earlier this week, Bitwise filed an industry-first application for a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. The first futures-based crypto ETF was approved three years ago, when regulators gave ProShares’ Bitcoin Trust a green light. Since the launch of spot-based alternatives, however, several asset managers have recalibrated futures-based offerings. VanEck said last month, for example, that it would liquidate its futures investment product for Ethereum. The firm cited investor interest and liquidity as factors for determining the move. Bitwise’s new fund is set to charge investors a 0.85% fee ratio, and its prospectus makes clear that it does not invest directly in digital assets. Because the fund can rotate its exposure into U.S. Treasuries completely, Bitwise said “there will be periods—and perhaps extended periods—when the Fund has no exposure to Bitcoin futures contracts” at all. While Bitwise lists its three funds’ “limited operating history” as a potential risk, Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said in a statement that the company is breaking new ground with the product. “At Bitwise, we believe there are many different ways in which investors will want to gain access to this new and emerging asset class,” he said. “We’re excited to introduce new groundbreaking strategies for these three ETFs to give investors more options for accessing the market.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Fusion startups have raised $7.1 billion to date, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with the majority of it going to a handful of companies. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. Now in its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The company, based in Richmond, British Columbia, was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. The company is currently building its first demonstration plant, LM26, which it hopes will hit scientific breakeven by 2026. Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. Based in Everett, Washington, Helion has raised $607.64 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Founded in 1998, TAE (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: After the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. TAE has raised $1.32 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Alphabet, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Venrock. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squishes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy has raised $285.65 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. Based in Oxfordshire, U.K., First Light has raised $179.94 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $109.3 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Across three days straight of losses so far in October, investors have cashed out a total of $361.2 million from such products, data from London investment firm Farside Investors shows. The outflows come after a week of solid inflows: Investors last week plugged over $1 billion into the funds. October—dubbed “Uptober” by some traders—is a month generally known for having high crypto prices in the past following what has historically been a chilly September for Bitcoin and other top assets. However, Bitcoin ultimately had a strong September this year after a rough initial start to the month. Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped below $60,000 on Thursday; now it stands at about $62,200, up more than 3% on the day. Bitcoin ETFs—approved for trading in the U.S. in January—led to the rise of the biggest and oldest asset this year. In March, the coin touched a new all-time high of $73,737 as investors previously unwilling to handle crypto assets threw cash at Bitcoin via the new regulated investment vehicles trading on stock exchanges. Wall Street titans such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck all have Bitcoin funds available to investors via brokerage accounts. But the fast-flowing cash has stalled in recent months. The reason? Geopolitical tensions aren’t helping, analysts told Decrypt this week. During times of political instability, investors tend to eye-up “safe haven” assets like gold or treasuries. We’re only in the first week of “Uptober,” though. Will investor sentiment change?

Title: Giant Banks Struggle, But Private Credit Is Soaring
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/donmuir/2024/10/04/giant-banks-struggle-but-private-credit-is-soaring/
Time Published: 2024-10-04T17:14:45Z
Full Content:
“It’s simple supply and demand” said the President of Monroe Capital. “When banks go through crises, there’s more regulatory oversight and they pull back, which shifts market share from banks to the private credit arena.” This rings especially true in Silicon Valley. I’ve experienced it firsthand through Arc’s capital marketplace, where hundreds of private credit investors like Monroe have been inundated with billions in loan demand since we launched in January. But why? Too Big to Fail banks struggle with reams of regulations and high reserve requirements. Regional banks tread cautiously past the bellyflops of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. In their wake, loans to high-tech outfits in the valley are now harder to find. Venture capital investment in Silicon Valley peaked in 2021 and took a dive. Private equity has followed a rocky path, with leveraged buyouts posting only an 8% return last year, the lowest in over a decade. In the public debt markets, rising interest rates have made borrowing costs untenable for issuers seeking financing. Prolonged economic uncertainty has stretched timelines for issuers. As a result, the market for publicly traded high-yield debt has shrunk by almost 25% in three years says M Capital Group. With crisis comes opportunity: private credit is soaring. The asset class features loans that lie outside the heavily regulated banking system, never to be traded publicly. This ~$2 trillion market is up 50% in the same three years in which public high-yield debt has fallen. Private debt gained $400 billion in that period, while public debt declined the same amount: a telling shift. That fat sum, in effect, left banking giants like J.P. Morgan Chase and flowed to the likes of Blackstone and Apollo. Supply and demand indeed. Private credit outpacing other asset classes Even more surprising: on top of that 50% growth since 2021, the private debt business is set to grow another 87% in the next five years. According to Ashwin Krishnan, co-head of North America Private Credit at Morgan Stanley, the private debt market will soar to $2.8 trillion by 2028. As he writes here, “private credit has filled a lending void” since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting stiff rules imposed on banks for capital requirements, loan terms, and disclosure. This turned the biggest, richest banks in the world into timid lenders, even as demand for loans surged on a rise in infrastructure projects (public and private) for clean energy, new chip plants, electric cars, and, more recently, vast spending on the AI wave. BlackRock has an even more aggressive forecast. It says the private-credit market will double in size to $3.5 trillion in 2028, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, KKR and State Street, the Journal says, now are competing for the next big prize in private debt: “full access to mom-and-pop investors when many sophisticated institutions are filing up on private credit.” The non-bank giants are “jostling to launch private-credit exchange-traded funds and other retail products,” the WSJ states. Apollo, which manages almost $700 billion in assets, expects to originate more than $200 billion a year in private loans eventually, doubling up on $97 billion in debt deals it did last year, the Financial Times reported. The firm sees “large demand to issue high-rated loans that will be purchased by its insurance arm Athene and other independent insurers,” the paper says. In a similar manner, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman recently announced the integration of its private credit and insurance groups in its effort “to reach $1 trillion in the next ten years.” No wonder Jamie Dimon is taking shots at private credit. In his letter to shareholders last month, he wrote: “Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced.” When you can’t beat ’em, impugn their creditworthiness. Jamie wishes his rivals in private credit had to endure the same burdensome regulations that J.P Morgan does. Yet, the ability to sidestep this tangle is precisely why private credit is thriving—and why corporate borrowers are lining up to get it. Unencumbered by a restrictive regulatory framework, private credit investors can move fast and price in risk in a way that banks simply cannot compete. This must be why Citigroup just announced a $25 billion private credit deal with Apollo to better serve Citi’s capital-starved clients. Last month, KKR extolled the private credit business to investors, describing a “structural shift away from the traditional commercial banking model,” and holding up a truly stunning figure: $40 trillion in future opportunity. Apollo, Blackstone and other private market heavyweights have synthetically replicated the traditional commercial banking model. But instead of highly-regulated bank deposits, they’re tapping deep pools of insurance capital, unlocking speed, flexibility and liquidity for the private markets at a time when equity remains expensive. Can you imagine all that business bypassing the likes of J.P. Morgan? As a fintech guy, I surely can. In fact, the upstarts of fintech already are making inroads into the private credit industry. The money center banks are Too Big to Call if you are running a tech company seeking, say, only $10 million to $100 million in financing. Yet, it can be hard to find lenders. The trick lies in how to match up an assortment of lenders, business borrowers, and investors willing to buy into a deal. And for private credit investors, the challenge is sifting through mountains of unstructured private company data to capitalize on the multi-trillion dollar market opportunity. Artificial intelligence, now advancing almost by the hour, can help a lot in this effort. At my company, Arc, we have been working on this, and the early results are exciting and encouraging.

Title: AIL preview: Terenure and Lansdowne lock horns in eagerly-awaited clash

Full Content:
Terenure host Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s taut semi-final at Lakelands Park in the standout tie of the Energia All-Ireland on Saturday afternoon. The two sides are among the cluster of six Division 1A teams who have won one and lost after two rounds. Each took two bonus points from their respective defeats but even so at least one of these big hitters will likely have ground to make up by teatime on Saturday. In light of Peter Sylvester’s departure, Terenure juggle their midfield again, with Jules Fenelon, a close-season capture from Trinity, making his first start, while Chris Cosgrave reverts to inside centre and Aran Egan to outhalf. Notable inclusions on the bench are Marcus Hanon, fit-again captain Luke Clohessy and the highly regarded Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel. Lansdowne give winger Todd Lawlor, part of Newbridge’s SCT last season, his debut and recall brother Donough at number eight. Harry O’Riordan at centre, outhalf Steve McMahon, flanker Clive Ross and tighthead Tom Connolly are all named. Clontarf, with a maximum 10 points, go to UCD at a time when Emerging Ireland and Leinster call-ups have weakened the students. Young Munster face a searching test of their unbeaten start away to champions Cork Constitution, who bounced back from an opening day loss to Terenure by beating Ballynahinch 51-21 last week. After unluckily returning empty-handed from Clontarf, Garryowen will look to build on their encouraging return to 1A at home to winless City of Armagh and ditto St Mary’s, significantly reinforced over the summer, when they head north to Ballynahinch. The two promoted sides have quickly set about supporting the view that they have raised the bar in 1A this season. The 1B pacesetters, Old Belvedere and Nenagh Ormond, will be in proximity when the former host Blackrock in Ollie Campbell Park while the Tipp club face Old Wesley in Energia Park. The 2A quartet with a maximum 10 points are all on the road, with Barnhall in Ballymena, Greytones in Instonians, Navan in Corinthians and Cashel away to Buccaneers. The early leaders in 2B, Wanderers and Skerries, are away to Malone and Dungannon respectively. In the Women’s Division, last season’s dominant two meet as champions UL Bohemians host Railway Union in a reprise of last April’s final at the Aviva Stadium, which the Limerick club won by 48-38. Men’s Division 1A: Ballynahinch v St Mary’s College, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Young Munster, Temple Hill; Garryowen v City of Armagh, Dooradoyle; Terenure College v Lansdowne, Lakelands Park; UCD v Clontarf, Belfield. Division 1B: Highfield v Dublin University, Woodliegh Park; Old Belvedere v Blackrock College, Ollie Campbell Park; Old Wesley v Nenagh Ormond, Energia Park; Queen’s v UCC, Dub Lane; Shannon v Naas, Thomond Park. Division 2A: Ballymena v MU Barnhall, Eaton Park; Buccaneers v Cashel, Dubarry Park; Greystones v Instonians, Dr. Hickey Park; Navan v Corinthians, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Banbridge, Takumi Park.

Title: Investors look to earnings to support record-high stock prices

By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - A high-stakes corporate earnings season kicks into gear next week, with bullish investors hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in a U.S. stock market near record highs. The case for strong U.S. economic growth got a boost on Friday, after labor market data came in far above expectations. The S&P 500 is up 20% year-to-date and stands near record highs despite recent tumult spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. A key test for the rally will arrive as corporate results begin rolling in next week. Companies need to post healthy profit growth and strong outlooks for next year to sustain valuations that have crept up in recent months: At 21.5 times future 12-month earnings estimates, the S&P 500 is trading near its highest level in three years and is well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. "One of the few rationales that the bulls can make for these lofty (valuation) multiples is that earnings growth keeps coming in at high levels," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "With prices having run up, you really do need that earnings growth to come in probably at much better than expected levels." S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 4.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, UBS equity strategists said in a report on Wednesday. However, earnings likely grew 8.5% when factoring in the historical rate of positive earnings surprises, the UBS strategists said. Such profit beats may be needed to fuel more gains in stocks. Since 2010, the S&P 500's total return has closely tracked the increase in company earnings and dividends, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. But the index has run ahead since early 2023, and is now about 18% above expected levels, based on current earnings and dividends, Ablin found. "The market's a little bit over its skis here," Ablin said. "It's certainly anticipating some pretty strong earnings and dividend growth." Data on U.S. consumer prices due next week will give investors another snapshot of the economy. A stronger than expected number, on the heels of Friday's jobs data, could further curtail expectations for how much the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in coming months. Futures tied to the fed funds rate on Friday showed pricing of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed's November meeting falling to 5%, from over 30% on Thursday, according to CME FedWatch. BANKS IN SPOTLIGHT Major financial firms highlight next week's earnings reports, with JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) due on Oct 11. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the state of delinquencies and loan demand, said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. More broadly, VanCronkhite will be looking for signs that the Fed's initial 50-basis point cut - delivered at its monetary policy meeting last month - is already having an effect on the economy through such channels as rising auto sales and other big ticket purchases. Ideally, such activity will be sustained even if expectations for further rate cuts fall further following Friday's strong jobs report. Following the first rate cut, companies ideally will show leading demand indicators are strengthening, VanCronkhite said. "That would probably give me confidence that we're heading more towards that soft landing," he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Jio Financial and U.S.-based BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) got in-principle approval from India's markets regulator to act as co-sponsors and set up a mutual fund business in the country, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group company said on Friday. Jio Financial said the Securities and Exchange Board of India will grant the final approval after the two companies fulfil certain requirements, on which it did not elaborate. Days after its demerger from Reliance Industries in July 2023, the company had announced the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with BlackRock to launch asset management services in India. The companies signed a second joint venture in April to set up a wealth management and broking business in the country.

Title: Irish women’s team braced for another tough WXV 1 assignment as Canada await on home soil

Ireland face one of the most difficult challenges in rugby late on Saturday night (Irish time) in trying to follow up beating the World Cup winners New Zealand with another win over hosts Canada on home soil. Currently ranked the number two side in the world rankings, Canada are also seeking their second win in the WXV 1 tournament in Vancouver, having beaten France in their first match. Both unbeaten sides go into the game with wind in their sails and with a weather eye on the World Cup next year in England. That, at least, is how Canada’s head coach Kevin Rouet is thinking. “We made some adjustments to the team after France because it is important that we continue to build depth in our squad,” said Rouet. “The Rugby World Cup will be a long journey and if we want to accomplish our ultimate goal, we will need a squad full of experienced and talented players. It will take more than just a group of 23 players.” Ireland coach Scott Bemand and his side go into the match with forced and unforced changes, and importantly without their captain Edel McMahon, who has been ruled out after sustaining a knock in training earlier in the week. That is a blow to Ireland, not least of all for McMahon’s leadership qualities on the pitch. Blackrock College’s inside centre, Enya Breen deputises and leads Ireland out for the first time. Breen’s Blackrock team-mate Emily Lane is another adjustment to the starting side and makes her Irish debut at scrumhalf beside Dannah O’Brien to complete the halfbacks. Olympic Sevens player Erin King, who came up big from off the bench in the game against New Zealand, is rewarded for her two tries. She starts this week at blindside flanker with Aoife Wafer, who also scored two tries last time out and was named player of the match, switching to openside in the absence of McMahon. The Kiwis did not know Wafer’s name before their game and referred to her as the red scrum cap. After two tries against Australia a few weeks ago and two against them last weekend, they do now. If Ireland can back up their win with even a draw against Canada, they will climb one place to fifth in the world so long as the current fifth-placed Scotland fail to beat Japan in their meeting this afternoon at The Athlone Sports Stadium in Cape Town. Ireland have not played Canada in eight years, but in beating France and scoring seven tries, Bemand is in no doubt about the difficulty of facing the hosts. France defeated Ireland 38-17 in their last meeting in this year’s Six Nations Championship. Like Ireland, two players scored twice for Canada last week including right wing Fancy Bermudez, who won the silver medal with the Canadian Sevens team in Paris last summer, and Laetitia Royer. Asia Hogan-Rochester is another one of the five Sevens players in the team, who also touched down last week. Of the double scorers just Burmudez starts against Ireland with Royer selected among the replacements. After breaking the all-time Canadian women’s cap record in May with her 68th cap, captain Tyson Beukeboom will hit another significant milestone against Ireland with her 70th. “A number of players have earned their opportunity in a green jersey on Saturday having worked hard to compete across the week and it will be a special moment for Enya to lead the team for the first time, supported by our leaders,” said Bemand. “A strong Canada outfit will provide a different challenge for us and we’re looking forward to testing ourselves against one of the best teams in the world.” The likelihood is Canada will defend with much more aggression than New Zealand did last week with several of the Irish tries, including King’s score at the end of the match, coming from passive defending on their line. It is a rare opportunity for Canada to play in front of home support, and this week their intentions could not have been made clearer. Ireland: Stacey Flood (Railway Union); Eimear Considine (UL Bohemian/Munster), Eve Higgins (Railway Union), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Emily Lane (Blackrock College); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Clíodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Erin King (Old Belvedere), Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: BlackRock Calls Bitcoin 'Global Monetary Alternative'

U.Today - The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has changed its official perspective on Bitcoin, now referring to it as a global monetary alternative. This is according to Jay Jacobs, the U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, during a recent digital assets conference. The presentation described the features of Bitcoin in comparison to conventional financial assets like U.S. gold and Treasuries. The presentation's main conclusions indicate that in contrast to the U.S. markets' variable supply, BlackRock views Bitcoin's supply as fixed. S. Treasury bonds and the gold supply are somewhat fixed. But in contrast to the relatively low volatility of U.S. stocks, volatility for Bitcoin is still high. The short track record of Bitcoin, in contrast to the medium and long histories of gold and Treasuries, is another significant distinction. However, Bitcoin differs from U.S. currency in that it is a decentralized asset akin to gold's money reserves. The presentation's second section concentrated on Bitcoin's volatility and relationships with other assets, especially gold and stocks. Since Bitcoin and the stock market have little historical correlation, Bitcoin is a desirable portfolio diversifier. Even though it is highly volatile, its volatility has declined over time, which has added to its increasing market maturity. The last section focused on the potential effects that even modest Bitcoin holdings could have on a conventional portfolio. Proposed were scenarios in which Bitcoin was allocated 1% to 5% of the portfolio. The results indicated that despite higher volatility, portfolios with Bitcoin experienced better returns and risk-adjusted metrics. Better returns are achieved with higher Bitcoin allocations, but risk metrics such as drawdowns are sharper. The wider market may continue to develop, bridging the divide between cryptocurrency and more established financial systems, as institutional players like BlackRock begin to include Bitcoin in their portfolios and see it as a viable alternative to traditional assets.

Title: Hurricane Helene and the ‘Known Unknown’ of Climate Costs

Time Published: 2024-10-04T14:58:41Z

(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.) Hurricane Helene is a significant human tragedy with more than 200 deaths reported as of Oct. 4. Thousands more have been left homeless, with North Carolina hit particularly hard. And the property damage will be difficult for the thousands of homeowners to manage without adequate flood insurance. Estimates of the economic damage vary. Moody’s initially put the price tag as high as $34 billion. Others, which take into account lost economic output, say the toll could top $100 billion. Despite the magnitude of these numbers, it’s easy to let them go in one ear and out of the other. After all, historically a mix of government institutions and insurance companies have absorbed the cost of a few of these disasters every year, paying out to rebuild. But past results are not necessarily indicative of future outcomes. As the number of billion-dollar disasters rises as a result of climate change, the economic toll of extreme weather will be increasingly difficult to absorb. Governments may hesitate to pay yet another disaster relief bill and insurers will likely continue to drop coverage in vulnerable areas. The result is a grim reality: many communities, individuals, and companies are susceptible to climate-driven economic tumult. This is a “known unknown.” We know it’s going to happen; it’s just a matter of when, and, to some degree, where these challenges will hit. When they do hit, investors, businesses, and individuals will want to ensure that they’re not left holding the bag. To understand the known unknowns of climate risk, it’s helpful to look at the numbers. In 2023, climate-related disasters cost the U.S. about 0.4% of GDP, according to a report from reinsurance giant Swiss RE. As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, those costs are only expected to grow. This cost represents a drag on economic growth that affects every corner of the economy, but not every community, company, or firm will be equally hit. Repeated disasters in one area may result in a dramatic spike in insurance prices for the local community or for insurers to pull out altogether. In either case, residents may choose to leave an area, driving down asset prices and depressing the local economy. Local firms will be affected directly and indirectly. A 2023 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at the effect of climate events on counties across the country. Severe storms, the study found, lead to a capital depreciation shock that drives down the value of local assets. Meanwhile, heat waves lead to a negative productivity shock that contributes to lower output. Both contribute to localized economic stagnation in the long-term. Some of this may already be reflected in the price of assets, but much of it likely isn’t. After all, it’s hard to know when, where, and how extreme weather events will play out—even if we have a general understanding of the contours of a climate-driven downturn. This is a reality that insurance companies and asset managers have been grappling with for years now. “The degree of capital reallocation and the speed of that is going to be larger and happen more quickly than most market participants expect,” Brian Deese told me in 2020 when he was the head of sustainable investing at BlackRock. At a national level, the most important solution to climate risk is to cut the emissions that are causing the problem. But with significant warming—and resulting climate disasters—already baked in, governments also need to double down on adaptation. Swiss RE says that one dollar invested in adaptation can save $11 in avoided climate disaster down the road. With those figures in mind, it would be foolish to wait for the government to get to work on adaptation. Companies can look at ways to harden their physical infrastructure where it works—and, in some cases, to move to safer locations. Investors, too, can help nudge portfolio companies and assets to adapt. And anyone located in a risky area should have appropriate insurance—at least for as long as they can get it.

Title: Through the Lost City of Tol’vir and onto Coren Direbrew

We had one normal mode dungeon left to do when we logged on last weekend. The Lost City of Tol’vir was all that was left to be checked off the list. Ready for the last normal mode dungeon For that final normal mode mission we had the same group as the last time around. The group this week Ula was still a ways from level 85, so we couldn’t queue for Coren Direbrew as an opener, so it was off to Uldum for the dungeon. A few of us went there directly as Ula wanted to get a tabard from the expansion to earn a bit more faction, so she took the Stormwind portal to get the Ramkahen tabard, it being handy and on the way. I assume they have something nice at revered, but at exalted you can get a riding camel. The Lost City is clearly visible on the map and just south of the Ramkahen settlement that forms the nexus of the zone, so she and Potshot flew down to the summoning stone to grab Liftkit and myself. We’ll figure out how to summon some day… We went on in, got ourselves setup, and started into the instance. Relative to the previous week’s run at the Halls of Origination, the lost city was simplicity itself, the whole thing on just one map with all bosses clearly marked. The Lost City of Tol’vir Sure, there is a bit of a winding path and some points where you can go left or right and Lockmaw, the second boss, who is off on his own dead end path… but it is all right there to see. There were even a couple of quests to do… which was not always the case in Cata dungeons. You had to, as an example, do pretty much all of Vashj’ir in order to get the dungeon quests for Throne of Tides, and I still have a Stonecore quests that I finished but can’t find the NPC to turn it in to. The whole things starts off with clearing some mobs, including a mass of tigers, in order to get to General Husam. Guide to the Lost City of Tol’Vir We cleared everything, if only for rep and some xp for Ula, even though it felt like we could skip some of it. And so we landed at the General. Hi General! I looked through the guide briefly and concluded that we could just “get him” and so we did. And we won, ignoring whatever special mechanics he had going for him. General mayhem For the first boss in an instance, that seems normal enough, though I was also interested to see if our recent burst of trying to gear up via Wintergrasp was going to trivialize normal mode for us. I mean, we struggled a bit back at Grim Batol, and had to go back for a second run to get the last boss. But here we were headed on across a bridge and down an open area clearing trash before realizing we were headed for the third boss. So we backtracked a bit because the second boss, Lockmaw, is off on a side path across another bridge. Eyeing Lockmaw and his herald Augh You start with Augh, who looks like he might be a mini boss, but then he disappears mid fight and you just move on to Lockmaw, during which Augh pops in to call in some adds. This put me into my favorite moment of pally tanking, which is “AOE all the things!” I move my attention to that section of my hotbar and unleash. In fact, it is hard to restrain me from that and I have broken more than my allowance of crowd control situations by trying to hit everything. I should tank for randoms on Dungeon Finder. All you need to do is keep running and hitting your AOE skills, right? I mean, that is my observation. Anyway, this time it worked and Lockmaw was done. I like the alignment of his jaw on death That done, we explored the building at the end of the path, just to be sure… and it was all just there for show. So we went back the way we came and looped around to High Prophet Barim, who happens to be about in the location where you start off in Uldum, having to escape from the Lost City. I appreciate a call back like that. The guide had all sorts of things to say about the fight with the High Prophet, including stuff to stay out of, things to run away from, and an add you will need to battle mid-fight. I was trying to digest that, but the voice in the back of my head, still high on the Lockmaw fight, was all, “Shoot them. Shoot them both.” So we just did it… and won. The High Prophet at a loss So yeah, maybe we had geared up a bit. And then it began to rain. Way to confuse people from California. But the sudden change in the weather was all part of the theme of the final boss, Siamat, Lord of the South Wind. And the weather also created some twisters we could jump on to ascend to his platform. We sent Liftkit in first, he having the most experience with this mechanic Up there we beheld the final boss on his raid slick domain. There he is… also, time for health stones This fight was lively, involved adds and a shocking number of special abilities. Literally shocking that is… some chain lightning going on there In the end however, we were able to outmatch him and he was defeated. Roll the achievement. These should be bumper stickers… Time for a victory shot… pity about the rain. We have been to the lost city Once done we were able to take the twister down the other side and head to the front of the instance to turn in the quests. Time to turn in With the quest turn in, Ula hit level 85… and you know what that meant. Time to go see Coren Direbrew… once I queued us up for the right instance. I accidentally queued us for a random dungeon, then quit that and got it right. Queued up for the Brewfest battle That put us once again in the Grim Guzzler in Blackrock Depths where this time Coren was waiting for us. Coren ranting about Brewfest There isn’t much to it… I went to speak to Coren, delivered the insult, refused to apologize, and it was on. It was also another “AOE All the Things!” fight, so I was happy to let loose. Battling Coren That went quickly and soon we had defeated him. Then there was some discussion about how, in past years, each one of us could insult him so we were allowed to battle him five times to get five shots at the best drops… those being the Brewfest mounts in my opinion. That didn’t seem to be an option… but then I queued us up again for him and we reloaded and there he was again. Core still on about Brewfest So we battled him again, and then once more for good measure. Some lolo put me in a barrel No mounts this time, but we can queue up again. Ula opened up a portal to get us to Brewfest to turn things in… and then another portal to get us to where Brefest is actually located. TIL: Mages can have multiple portals running Of course, now that we’re done with normal mode dungeons, we have only heroic options before us. Personally, I am not too keen to re-run things we did on normal, but there are a few heroic only instances like Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep that we do want to peek into. Of course, I checked on that before the group parted for the evening… and we have a bit of gear work to do. Ula is so close So we’ll get to that before we… you know… just jump into heroic. TIL: Mages can have multiple portals running Uh… ::blink:: I used to do that all the time back in Vanilla Classic. I didn’t realize people thought that wasn’t a thing. LikeLike I didn’t think about it at all until I saw Ula put up two. Not a mage player here. LikeLike “AOE All the Things!”: a strategy I can get behind ;) LikeLike Indeed one of the most devious things you can do as a mage is open two portals without moving in between. It looks like you’re going to place A, but IIRC, it would send people randomly to either A or B. Hilarity would ensue, naturally. LikeLike If I’m remembering it correctly, you can still zone in to a heroic if you walk in the front. It’s only group finder that gatekeeps you by ilevel. I could be wrong, though, as there’s so many changes to this stuff over the years. I just remember doing it that way early on in expansions when we were undergeared, but were trying to get everyone ready for raiding. It was painful at times, but we managed to make it through eventually. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Election 2024 coverage presented by The U.S.-listed bitcoin (BTC) and ether {ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are doing their part in contributing to the downward price pressures of crypto this week, with bitcoin down 6% and ether down 10%. Investors drained $54.2 million from bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 3, the third consecutive day of net outflows, taking the three-day tally to $361.2 million, according to Farside Investors. The main contributions on Thursday were Ark's ARKB, at $58.0 million, and Fidelity's FBTC, at $37.2 million. BlackRock's IBIT saw an inflow of $36.0 million. Grayscale's GBTC remains relatively muted, with just $5.9 million in outflows this week. That said, the 11 ETFs have amassed a total of $18.5 billion in investor money since inception. Besides, investors are up on average on their investment around 3-10% with an average deposit cost basis between $54,911 and $59,120, according to Glassnode data. The methodology used by Glassnode uses price stamping of bitcoin deposits to ETFs for the top three ETF issuers, which provides a rough break-even point for ETF investors. The data suggests, investors in Fidelity's FBTC has a cost basis of $54,911, Grayscale at $55,943, and BlackRock $59,120. In 2024, these cost basis have provided excellent price support for bitcoin, testing the lower bound multiple times during bull market corrections. At the same time, ether ETFs experienced a net outflow of $3.2 million Thursday. Outflows came from Grayscale's ETHE of $14.7 million, which has now seen a total of $2.9 billion in withdrawals. BlackRock ETHA saw a $12.1 million inflow. Ether ETFs now have a total outflow of $555.4 million, according to Farside Investors data. Still, the performance of BTC and ETH ETFs is impressive compared to industry standards, according to Nate Geraci, President of the ETF store. "Out of 525 ETFs launched in 2024, 13 of the top 25 are either bitcoin or ether related," Geraci said. As of press time, bitcoin was trading at $61,608, while ether was changing hands at $2,391, according to CoinDesk data. Edited by Omkar Godbole.

(Reuters) - It's a packed week ahead with U.S. inflation data, the start of Q3 earnings, a French budget and possibly a big rate cut from New Zealand. Investors are also on edge as Middle East tensions escalate, while Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is in the spotlight. Here's all you need to know about the week ahead in global markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo. 1/ ONE YEAR OF WAR One year on from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the region looks on the brink of a sprawling war that could potentially reshape the oil-rich Middle East. The conflict, which has killed more than 42,000 people, the vast majority in Gaza, is spreading. Israeli troops are now in neighbouring Lebanon, home to Iran-backed Hezbollah; Iran launched a large scale missile attack on Israel earlier this week. Global markets have remained broadly unfazed. Oil prices, the main conduit for tremors further afield, have jumped about 8% this week, but soft demand and ample supply globally have kept a lid on gains. A further escalation between Iran and Israel could change that, especially if Israel strikes Iran's oil facilities, an option that U.S. President Joe Biden said was under discussion. The scars of the conflict are visible on Israel's economy, which has suffered a number of sovereign downgrades and seen its default insurance spike and bonds slide. 2/ BUSY TIMES U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, posing a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at elevated valuations. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report on Friday. Other results earlier in the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased Q3 earnings by 5.3% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. Thursday's September U.S. consumer price index, meanwhile, will be closely watched for signs that inflation is moderating. Investors are already anticipating hefty rate cuts, after the Federal Reserve kicked off its easing cycle last month. Elsewhere, investors will seek to gauge the economic fallout from a dockworker strike as U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports reopened on Thursday. 3/ A RECKONING France's new government presents its long-awaited budget to parliament on Thursday. It's planning a 60-billion-euro belt-tightening drive, around 2% of GDP, next year. It reckons spending cuts and tax hikes should bring the deficit, seen rising to 6.1% this year in the latest upward revision, to 5% by end-2025. The target date for reaching the euro zone's 3% deficit limit is also being pushed back to 2029 from 2027. That's bad news just ahead of rating reviews kicking off with Fitch next Friday. Markets are not impressed. Having eased slightly, the extra premium France pays for its 10-year debt over Germany's widened back to just under 80 bps, near its highest since August. Ultimately, what may matter more is whether Prime Minister Michel Barnier can pass the budget, given a divided parliament that has investors questioning how long his government will last. 4/ FEELING SHEEPISH A reluctant joiner to global easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is catching up fast. It meets on Oct. 9 and traders reckon the central bank could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The RBNZ cut rates by 25 bps to 5.25% in August, a year ahead of its own projections. Markets price in a drop below 3% by end-2025. This will still be above where traders think U.S. and euro area rates will be. Shorter-term investors are neutral towards the kiwi, but hedge funds have lapped it up this year. Positioning and potentially higher rates than others might insulate New Zealand's currency. So could the return of so-called carry trades and in this case, essentially a bearish bet on the yen in favour of bullish ones on high-yielders such as the kiwi. 5/ POLL POSITIONING When Shigeru Ishiba surprised markets by winning the contest to become Japan's prime minister, investors rushed to re-position themselves for higher interest rates. A week on and the landscape looks different, as Ishiba back-flipped not just on monetary policy, but on prior market-unfriendly support for higher corporate and capital gains taxes. It's perhaps not surprising for a hawk to hide his talons with a snap election looming on Oct. 27. Even so, Ishiba was unabashedly blunt, saying after a meeting with the Bank of Japan - whose independence Ishiba has pledged to honour - that the economy is not ready for further rate hikes. The yen, which had been surging, slid past 147 to a six-week trough by Thursday. Japanese stocks rebounded from their steepest slide since early August. Check back in a month from now for any further policy flip-flops. (Graphics by Kripa Jayaram, Pasit Kongkunakornkul, Vineet Sachdev; Compiled by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Sonali Paul)

While Fidelity and BlackRock dominate the performance charts, which ETFs are lagging behind? As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a broader downturn, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are not immune to the prevailing trends. Recent reports from Farside Investors reveal that BTC ETFs experienced significant outflows, amounting to $52.9 million on 2nd October. However, amidst this challenging landscape, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has identified two standout Bitcoin ETFs—BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC—as top performers of the 2020s. Both funds have achieved “stud level” status, boasting over $10 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), highlighting their resilience and appeal to investors even in turbulent times. In his X (formerly Twitter) post, Balchunas noted, Source: Eric Balchunas/X Echoing Balchunas’ sentiment, an X user added, Source: Charles/X This trend was further confirmed by data from Farside Investors, revealing that since its launch, BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed a staggering $21.5 billion in total inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC has attracted $9.9 billion. These two ETFs have set the pace, leaving other funds trailing. However, October, traditionally viewed as an “Uptober” month following a declining September, has brought mixed results. On the 1st of October, IBIT experienced an inflow of $40.8 million, contrasting sharply with FBTC, which faced outflows of $144.7 million. IBIT recorded outflows of $13.7 million on the 2nd of October, while FBTC rebounded with inflows of $21.1 million, illustrating the volatility and shifting dynamics within the ETF landscape. Conversely, the performance of Ethereum [ETH] ETFs has also been underwhelming. On the 1st of October, cumulative outflows for ETH ETFs reached $48.6 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA experiencing no inflows or outflows, while Fidelity’s FETH saw outflows of $25 million. ETHA continued to struggle, posting outflows of $18 million on the following day. Whereas FETH maintained a steady position with no flows recorded. This trend highlights the challenges facing Ethereum ETFs in the current market environment. Amidst there was another X user who asked a very concerning question, “Would this not then make #GBTC one of the worst performing ETFs of this decade?” This observation is further substantiated by the latest update from Farside Investors, revealing that Grayscale’s GBTC has experienced a staggering total outflow of $20.1 billion since its launch. Similarly, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF, ETHE, had faced significant outflows totaling $2.93 billion, which surpassed the combined outflows of all other ETH ETFs. On the price front, both cryptocurrencies were experiencing a downward trend, with Bitcoin trading at $60,480.03, reflecting a decline of 0.98% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum was trading at $2,347.81, showing a more substantial dip of 4.35% over the same period.
