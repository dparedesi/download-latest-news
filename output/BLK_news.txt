The involvement of such a high-profile Gaelic games personality as Jim Gavin in the race for the Áras underlines how infrequently the GAA has been a significant factor in the careers of past presidents. Gavin’s life as a public servant in both the armed forces and aviation sector has been combined with civic involvement. Between chairing Dublin’s North East Inner City programme implementation board and the Citizen’s Assembly on a directly elected mayor for the city, he has decent credentials for a run at elected office. How he fares in the bear pit of securing the Fianna Fáil nomination is one thing, and if successful, the circumstances of having his life forensically scrutinised will be another matter. But he has clearly prepared for this and will have detailed plans to take it on one step farther. At Oireachtas and government level, there has never been any shortage of GAA-gene pool politicians, especially in Fianna Fáil. Current Taoiseach Micheál Martin is a committed Nemo Rangers supporter. His predecessor Brian Cowen played football for Offaly. The exemplar of the connection is Jack Lynch, winner of six successive All-Ireland medals and a lifelong supporter of Gaelic games. Given the strength of that connection, the broader question of why the GAA has been so sparsely represented in the Phoenix Park comes into focus in the week of Éamon De Valera’s 50th anniversary. His assertion that hurling and rugby were the games most suited to the Irish temperament is well known and this newspaper had a role in Dev’s most famous, or notorious, statement about Gaelic games, made just two years before he became president. Speaking at the southern branch of the Blackrock Past Pupils’ Union annual dinner, held at Shannon Airport in April 1957, he regretted that hurling was no longer played in the school. There was also a lament that he had felt unable to attend a rugby match since 1913 because he didn’t “want it raised as a political matter and having rows kicked up about it but I will not deny that I am a keen listener to rugby commentaries”. An Irish Times reporter was on hand to detail the following controversial statement. “For Irishmen there is no football game that could equal rugby and if all our young men played rugby,” he said, “we would not only beat England and Wales, but France and the whole lot of them together.” It was hardly surprising that in the one county guaranteed to have a view on what football game was paramount, the then-taoiseach’s views came under scrutiny. At a meeting in Tralee on May 11th, Kerry county board squabbled over whether De Valera’s comments were or were not “worthy of discussion”. County chair FJ Sheehy said that he was afraid that “the taoiseach was letting too many statements go by the board”. James Barrett, of the well-known Tralee family, said that the taoiseach was being taken out of context and had issued a denial and clarified his original statement to the effect that “Irishmen in international rugby would have made a name for themselves but that hurling was their game”. The chair wasn’t convinced, saying that if the original report had been correct, it was “an outlandish statement”. JJ Sheehy, the 1920s All-Ireland winner and well-known republican, was reported as saying that it was “not the games they were comparing but the things for which they stood. The GAA fighting for the freedom of the country, the language, the games and everything distinctive of Irish nationalism”. In the end, the board decided against issuing a statement by 13 votes to eight. In a postscript, the editor of The Irish Times said the paper was satisfied that their reporter’s version of the original speech was correct. De Valera was still a fixture at All-Ireland finals during his presidency. He was never a member of the GAA, though. This was significant during the association’s most notorious interaction with the presidency during the very first term of office of Douglas Hyde. In November 1938, Hyde together with taoiseach De Valera, attended an Ireland-Poland soccer match at Dalymount Park. The president was also patron of the GAA and his presence at the international was a breach of the then operative ban on foreign games. The GAA could do nothing about De Valera’s attendance, as he wasn’t a member but Hyde was removed as patron of the association. [ Jim Gavin profile: Is the former Dublin GAA manager a good fit for president?Opens in new window ] It is ironic that the most successful of the movements for cultural independence that took root at the end of the 19th century, was the sporting one – the GAA – but despite its local community base, it has had limited success in providing candidates for the presidency. Perhaps the underlying exclusiveness of the association for many years – it’s little more than 50 years since the ban was abolished and even less time since the prohibitions on British security force membership and the use of GAA grounds by other sports, followed it – impacted at a broader level. It is true that a recent president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin, former Antrim player and Sigerson Cup winner with Queen’s, are very much from that background and the former president is currently grappling with the knotty challenge of integrating the women’s and men’s Gaelic games associations. But McAleese’s background was as a lawyer with political connections to Fianna Fáil when initially elected in 1997. Given that a successful presidential term can make it harder to get out of the Áras than into it, whoever wins in October might well be in office until 2039, taking it beyond the centenary of the presidency, which was originally devised in the 1937 Constitution. Has the time come for a successful candidate whose primary profile arises from Gaelic games? sean.moran@irishtimes.com Get an in-depth look at the weekend's action and the best analysis of upcoming fixtures in our weekly newsletter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘The judge told me I would die in prison’ – Irishman to share his story of being held hostage in Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block’

Bernard Phelan, in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom from Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block,’ where he was held for over 200 days. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. An innocent Irishman held hostage in ‘Satan’s Block’ in Iran for over 200 days, told an RTÉ documentary a judge informed him: “You will die in prison.” The harrowing jail term saw former tourism worker Bernard Phelan, aged in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom. Mr Phelan went from working in tourism IT and co-owning a well known LGBTQ+ bar in Paris - to being imprisoned, wrongly accused of providing information to an enemy country. You Will Die In Prison, An Irishman’s Hostage story, airs tonight at 10.35pm on RTÉ One and unearths the mental and physical toll one innocent man withstood and his survival against the might of the Iranian regime. Born in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, Mr Phelan grew up in Blackrock, South Co Dublin. He was living in Paris, before being taken hostage in Mashhad, Iran in October 2022. “I was taken to an interrogation centre in a car, blindfolded and handcuffed and that's when the nightmare really started,” Mr Phelan told the RTÉ documentary. “As I left the room, the judge said to me, through his translation: ‘You will die in prison.’ That was a big shock.” After visiting the country as a tourist, Mr Phelan struck up a business relationship with a company offering adventure tours. And in September 2022, he visited Iran to meet the business owners. However, the dual Irish-French national was, he admits, in the “wrong place at the wrong time.” The country had just witnessed a watershed moment, an uprising for women’s rights, after the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. The young woman was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with Iranian Government protocol. She died in police custody, sparking huge protests, the likes never witnessed in Iran. As he visited the exterior of the holy Imam Reza Mosque in Mashhad, where his business partner was taking photographs, Mr Phelan was arrested and taken to an interrogation centre. He was blindfolded and handcuffed and “that’s when the nightmare really started,” he said. Mr Phelan was kept in chains and named Number 67 in Arabic. When his number was called, he had no idea if he was to be given bread or have his throat slit. He described being moved to Mashhad Prison, meant to hold 1,500 prisoners, but where he believed there may be as many as 20,000. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 3rd 2025 A judge warned him he may die in the jail. But determined to secure his freedom, Mr Phelan launched a campaign from his prison cell. His father Vincent Phelan hand delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy in Dublin calling for his release. Mr Phelan befriended a political prisoner, Taj Muhammed Khormali, eventually executed on April 8, 2025. “Sometimes you heard them crying,” Mr Phelan said, of the prisoners condemned to death. “You don’t know when you’re going to die, it could be tomorrow morning or two years time,” he said. “I imagined my health would give up,” he said. “I wasn't in good health, I had high blood pressure, HIV… I take medication to avoid stroke. I take tablets for depression. My mental state was very fragile. I really had very black thoughts." He told the documentary he went on hunger strike but was forced to relent when his father begged him to stop. "Please don't do this to me, I want to see you alive,” his father wrote. “If my dad died while I was in prison, I’d have gone back on hunger strike,” Mr Phelan, who still suffers from PTSD, said. The tide only began to turn when President Michael D Higgins wrote twice to his father, promising he would do all he could to assist. The family then pressured the Irish Government via the media on its plans to open an Irish embassy in Tehran. This led to Irish-French negotiations with Iran, with Mr Phelan’s release being the linchpin to future embassy plans. “If I’d had my visa and my Irish passport, I’d not have been arrested,” Mr Phelan believes. He was finally released in May 2023 and flown back in a medical bed to Paris. His husband, Roland Bonello and family, greeted him at the airport. In October, 2024, Vincent Phelan finally got to meet President Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, with his son. But just one week later the 98-year-old passed away. “My dad was so proud he got to see Michael D. The next day he had an accident and passed away a week later, shortly before his 99th birthday,” he said. “But he got to see the president and got letters from the president. He had a good life, an unusual end of life because of me. It was a full life.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Holds Back on XRP as ETF Rumors Heat Up for Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink

Time Published: 2025-09-03T02:00:30Z

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has opted not to file for a U.S. spot XRP ETF in 2025 despite the SEC reclassifying XRP as a digital commodity and settling its lawsuit with Ripple. The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

The index tracks the seven largest US technology companies, Coinbase's own stock, and BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase will launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure, according to a Sept. 2 announcement. The product will debut on Sept. 22, arriving less than two months after Coinbase began offering CFTC-regulated perpetuals to US customers in July. The hybrid index tracks 10 equally weighted components: the seven largest US technology companies, known as the “Magnificent Seven,” Coinbase’s own stock, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Each component represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weightings. The Magnificent Seven stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. The cryptocurrency exposure is provided through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), offering indirect access to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. Coinbase positions the product as addressing investor demand for dual exposure to traditional financial instruments and digital assets. The company stated that no US-listed derivative previously offered access to both equities and cryptocurrencies within a futures product. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via The monthly cash-settled contracts represent $1 multiplied by the index value. At an example index price of $3,000, each contract would carry a notional value of $3,000. MarketVector serves as the official index provider for calculation and maintenance. The launch builds on Coinbase’s derivatives expansion following its July introduction of CFTC-regulated perpetual contracts for US customers. Those products offer up to 10x leverage with 0.02% fees on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coinbase frames the equity index futures as marking “the next evolution of our product suite” and paving the way for multi-asset derivatives that broaden access and efficiency for investors. The company promises to expand availability to retail users in the coming months after the initial launch through partner platforms.

Alphabet shares popped 6% in extended trading. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice, including selling off its Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads. “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,” the decision states. “Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The Problem Is Solved by Art, Not Science

Time Published: 2025-09-02T20:00:00Z

Editor Solutions Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey A. Tucker So much of what is considered science today is really just art. It’s a subjective interpretation of the meaning of data. Data does not speak for itself. It does not tell you cause and effect. It provides no predictive map for the future. It’s often incorrect or merely a proximate rendering of the full reality. Even the best and most experienced experts and invested stakeholders cannot overcome this problem. The implications of this insight are vast. Let’s start with an easy example. Did you see Gladiator II? It had many of the same actors as the first movie that swept the awards and captivated audiences worldwide. It had bloody fight scenes. It had great music. It had creepy relationships, wicked power plays, feats of derring-do, displays of all kinds of cruelty and heroics, plus CGI of a recreated Roman Colosseum, this time with the floor flooded with water for a sea battle. And yet the movie left audiences with not much. The experience was overall evaporative and the message elusive. The magic was missing. That special story arc of drama that swept us up in the first was strangely absent. At some point halfway through – and speaking as someone who loved the first – it struck me that I could walk away and not really care how it ended. This often happens with sequels. It’s not just because the directors and producers see an easy buck by roping in audiences to throw down for tickets, hoping to relive the experience of the first. Sequels are often a pale copy of the first because the producers, scriptwriters, and directors are themselves not entirely sure why the first one was great. The movie makers can workshop this all day and for weeks. They can gather focus groups. They can talk to experts. They can pay the actors the big bucks. Everyone will have a theory, and they can try to recreate and reboot the thing as best they can. But at some point, no matter how hard they try and with many millions on the line, they leave the magical creative world of art and enter into the mundane task of recreation. With all their efforts, the drama is drained away. No one knows for sure when or how that happens. This example comes to mind in the midst of the continued meltdown over the logo change at Cracker Barrel. It seems obvious in retrospect that eliminating Uncle Herschel (a real person who was the uncle of the founder) and the barrel was a bad idea. It comes at a time of rising nostalgia and deep public suspicion of major corporations and their perceived attack on basic values. Maybe it is not entirely clear why this one logo change would have ignited populist fury in normal times but when you consider the loss of trust in everything, this struck people as deeply offensive. We learn from deeper reports on the decision that it was not arbitrary. The new CEO Julie Felss Masino, hired in 2023, was tasked with bringing back customers and the stock price after it was slammed during Covid lockdowns. That’s a huge challenge for anyone, especially given the roaring inflation that followed the money printing of the period. Julie reached into her communications undergraduate degree and her Master’s of Business Administration and found a possible answer. The goal is to attract a younger generation. She had heard from her social set many times that the union of the word “cracker” with a white guy in overalls has racist overtones. Maybe it refers to cracking the whip. Maybe it is a signal that only whites are allowed. Maybe the overalls suggest it is only for farmers or aging nostalgists. In any case, it seemed obvious to her that an update was in order. Further, the executive team brought in focus groups. They did customer surveys. They assembled all the empirical evidence they could find. In the end, they discerned that they would win more with a change than they would lose from those who would miss the old sign. This intuition was further backed by a plan for interior changes. Down with all the bric-a-brac on the walls and up with a cleaner look of an Apple store. After all, this is where interior design seems to be headed. Shouldn’t Cracker Barrel keep up? And yet, once the announcement was made, the customers and the public were invited to respond. What they saw was one of the few franchises with symbolism that drew on cultural memory and its replacement by the soulless, barren, and deracinated symbolism that has defined so much of what everyone hates about public life today. It suggested that yet another huge corporation was trampling on history, tradition, and meaning. Consumers these days are interested in testing their power in ways akin to voters. They will buy or decline to buy as a way of rewarding or punishing companies that make decisions that affect the aesthetics of public life. We’ve seen this with Jaguar, Bud Light, Target, and many other companies that have run afoul of the emerging public mood that trends toward a kind of restoration. To reward or decline to do so is the very essence of the capitalist experience. It is a manner of taking back power for the people. Companies make mistakes all the time. That’s because marketing is not science. It is art, an extension of human judgment, just like making movies or writing songs. We can flatter ourselves that the answer is always in the data. They can do surveys and focus groups. But often all those techniques can lead managers astray to the point that they land far afield of what could be called common sense. If anyone from Cracker Barrel’s management had entered a restaurant and shown the two images side by side to an average customer, they could have anticipated the uproar. The problem is that ideology is blinding toward reality that any average person can see. The same is true of high-end credentials and impressive resumes. They confer not wisdom but exaggerated confidence in subjective judgment. The career of the new CEO took her from Sprinkles Cupcake to Starbucks to Taco Bell. Surely she has the requisite experience. But what if that experience consisted of working within a tight bubble of influence of people from her social and professional class? After all, she kept trading up in her career and now pulls in $6.8 million a year – not exactly in keeping with the medium family income of the typical customer of Cracker Barrel. The point is that her class and social bubble affected her judgment, as well as those around her. All the data, surveys, and focus groups did not dislodge her prevailing theory that modernization was the key to return to profitability. The test happened in real life: the decision was a calamity. Maybe it pleased BlackRock, which is the largest single stockholder. Maybe it pleased her social set. She was certainly pleased with the decision. But the general public flew into fury. Management and marketing in graduate school is often rendered as empirical sciences. That’s ridiculous but such is the bias of our age. Everyone thinks there is some system, some mechanism, some machine, some data set, that will point the right way. This applies in every area, including infectious disease, pharmacology, government, and thousands of other fields. The belief that the data speaks for itself is the religion of our time. The trouble is that it does not. We are just as controlled by value systems and subjective judgment as were men in the ancient world. All our techniques have changed nothing about this. This week, for example, Brownstone Institute found itself embroiled in a highly technical argument over the RSV shot for babies. An outside committee of the CDC approved it with only two no votes, one member of whom reported real doubts about the data. Sure enough, Brownstone reported the problems, which are highly technical. Then it got worse as more data scientists weighed in. Now there is a genuine question about whether the committee was presented with truthful data. The larger issue is that the manufacturer wanted the shot approved and so did the CDC. The study and data and appearance of science was secondary, a mere veneer to a larger agenda that was driven by a value proposition. They wanted the shot out there. The science was just the excuse. But then it fell apart or, at least, did not hold up to the promise. Now we find ourselves again in the awkward position of having trusted the experts and discovering that this was not a good idea. One of the great books of our age is Tom Harrington’s The Treason of the Experts. He writes from the point of view of the humanities, explaining many of the above points. He explains that everyone is working hard to find the science of what is really an art. This point applies to the healing arts as well. Why did anyone think that locking down society would be good for health? It’s nuts and anyone could have known that, unless the person had a head full of models and maths. The fake science literally blinded the entire world. What’s happened to many brands and to many countries traces to the adoption of a superstition with a scientific veneer. Fortunately, the people have some limited means of making a correction, smacking the fake experts around a bit, and resetting the world to operate in a way that is more humane and intuitively truthful. This could be the next stage of history. With the experts and the science having led us to a place of disaster, the principles, arts, and ethics of old can lead us back to a better place.

Title: AI chatbots for doctors are hot. But there’s plenty of value ‘down the stack’ too, argues Corti CEO

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Among the most interesting AI stories this week was an item about a Boston-area startup called OpenEvidence that uses generativeAI to provide answers to clinical questions based data from leading medical journals. The free-to-use app has proved enormously popular among doctors, with some surveys suggesting at least 40% of all U.S. physicians are using OpenEvidence to stay on top of the latest medical research and to ensure they are offering the most up-to-date treatments to patients. On the back of that kind of viral growth, OpenEvidence was able to raise $210 million in a venture capital deal in July that valued the company at $3.5 billion. OpenEvidence is also the same company that a few weeks back said that its AI system was able to score 100% on the U.S. medical licensing exam. (See the “Eye on AI Numbers” section of the August 21st edition of this newsletter.) All of which may explain why, just a month later, the company is reportedly in talks for another venture deal that would almost double that valuation to $6 billion. (That’s according to a story in tech publication The Information which cited three unnamed people it said had knowledge of the discussions.)A lot of the use of OpenEvidence today would qualify as “shadow AI”—doctors are using it and finding value, but they aren’t necessarily admitting to their patients or employers that they are using it. They are also often using it outside enterprise-grade systems that are designed to provide higher-levels of security, data privacy, and compliance, and to integrate seamlessly with other business systems.Ultimately, that could be a problem, according to Andreas Cleve, the cofounder and CEO of Corti, a Danish medical AI company that is increasingly finding traction by offering healthcare institutions “AI infrastructure” designed specifically for medical use cases. (Full disclosure: Corti’s partners include Wolters Kluwer, a huge software company that markets a clinical evidence engine called UpToDate that competes with OpenEvidence.) AI infrastructure is a pivot for Corti, which was founded way back in 2016 and spent the first decade of its existence building its own speech recognition and language understanding systems for emergency services and hospitals. The company still markets its “Corti assistant” as a solution for healthcare systems that want an AI-power clinical scribe that can operate well in noisy hospital environments and integrate with electronic health records. But Cleve told me in a recent conversation that the company doesn’t see its future in selling a front-end solution to doctors, but instead selling key components in “the AI stack” to the companies that are offering front-end tools. “We tried to be both a product vendor for healthcare and an infrastructure vendor, and that meant competing with all the other apps in healthcare, and it was like, terrible,” he says. Instead, Corti has decided its real value lies in providing the “healthcare grade” backend on which AI applications, many of them produced by third parties, run. The backend Corti provides includes medical AI models—which others can wrap user-facing products around—as well as the platform on which AI agents for healthcare use cases can run. For instance, it has built an API called FactsR, which is an AI reasoning model that is designed to check the facts that medical notetaking scribes or clinical AI systems produce. It uses a lot of tokens, Cleve says, which would make it too expensive for general purpose voice transcription. But because of how much is riding on clinical notes being accurate, it can be worth it to a vendor to pay for FactsR, Cleve says.Another example: earlier this summer Corti announced a partnership with Voicepoint, a speech recognition and digital transcription service that is used by doctors across Switzerland. Voicepoint will use Corti’s AI models to help with tasks such as summarization of conversations into medical notes and possibly, in the future, with diagnostic support. To do this though, Corti had to set up dedicated AI infrastructure, including data centers located in Switzerland, to comply with strict Swiss data residency rules. Now, Corti is able to offer this same backbone infrastructure to other healthcare companies that want to deploy AI solutions in Switzerland. And Corti has similar AI infrastructure in place in countries like Germany that also have strict data residency and data privacy rules.Cleve tells me that healthcare is increasingly part of the discussions around “sovereign AI.” This is particularly true in Europe, where many governments are worried about having their citizens’ medical information stored on the servers of U.S. companies, which might be subject to U.S. government pressure, legal or otherwise, to provide data access. “None of these things are doable today, because the majority of all the AI apps are running on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, and they are all American companies over which America asserts jurisdiction,” Cleve says.But even within the U.S., strict cybersecurity and patient privacy requirements often mean that using an off-the-shelf, general-purpose AI system won’t cut it. “A lot of customers have requirements like, ‘Hey, we will never want to have data leave premises, or we will never share a tenant, or we will never co-encrypt with our consumer customer on the GPU rack, because we want to know where our data is because we have to prove that to legislators,’” he says. Cleve also tells me that he thinks the giant, general purpose AI builders—the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—are unlikely to conquer healthcare, despite the fact that they have been making moves to build models either fine-tuned or specifically-trained to answer clinical questions. He says this is because healthcare isn’t a single vertical, but rather a collection of highly-specialized niches, most of which are too narrow to be interesting to these tech behemoths. The note-taking needs of a GP in a relatively quiet office who needs to summarize a 10-minute consultation are quite different from a doctor working in the chaos and noise of a busy city ER, which are different again from a psychiatrist who needs to summarize not just a 10-minute consultation, but maybe an hour-long therapy session. As an example, Cleve says another Corti customer is a company in Germany that makes software just to help dentists automate billing based on audio transcripts of their sessions with patients. “They’re a vertical within a vertical,” he says. “But they are growing like 100% a year and have done so for several years. But they are super niche.” It will be interesting to watch Corti going forward. Perhaps Cleve is correct that the AI stack is wide enough, deep enough and varied enough to create opportunities for lots of different vertical and regional players. Or, it could be that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google devour everyone else. Time will tell. With that, here’s more AI news. Jeremy Kahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.com@jeremyakahn Correction, Sept. 3: A previous version of this story misreported the year Corti was founded.

The company said it has begun publicly testing MAI-1-preview, its first large foundation AI model built fully in-house, as well as MAI-Voice, a fast voice generation model that is small enough to run on a single GPU. The new models mark a significant step by Microsoft to reduce its reliance on OpenAI, despite remaining a major investor in the AI company. MAI-1-preview was trained with 15,000 Nvidia H100 chips, according to Microsoft, and will be rolled out for some Microsoft Copilot text tasks in the coming weeks. In the LMArena, a public benchmark for LLMs, the model currently ranks below rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others. You can read more from CNBC here. OpenAI says it will add parental controls and additional safeguards to ChatGPT. The company said it would, within the next month, allow parents to link their accounts to those of their teenage children, giving them more control over the kids' interaction with ChatGPT. It also said that it would soon institute better safeguards in general, actively screening interactions for signs of emotional distress on the part of users and routing these conversations to its GPT-5 Thinking model, which the company says does a better job of adhering to guardrails meant to prevent the model from encouraging self-harm or delusional behavior. The moves come after a high-profile lawsuit accused the company's ChatGPT model of encouraging the suicide of a 16-year old teen and several other cases in which people allege ChatGPT encouraged suicide, self-harm, or violence. You can read more here from Axios. Anthropic valued at $183 billion after $13 billion venture capital round. The AI company announced that it had raised $13 billion Series F funding round led by the venture capital firm Iconiq, and "co-led" by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners. A long list of other investors—including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, Jane Street, and T. Rowe Price, among others—also participated. The company, which was previously valued at $61.5 billion in a March funding round, said it now served more than 300,000 business customers and that its Claude Code coding model was currently generating at least $42 million in revenue each month. Anthropic's blog post announcing the funding round is here. X.ai enters the battle for coders with new AI “agentic coding” model. The company debuted its first AI coding model, called grok-code-fast-1, which is supposed to be both “speedy and economical,” according to the company. It is being made available for free for a limited time and is both available on GitHub and through coding “wrappers” such as Cursor and Windsurf. The model is an indication that X.ai founder Elon Musk is serious about taking on OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind across the entire range of AI applications, not just in the consumer chatbot space. It also shows just how intense the competition to capture marketshare among software developers is becoming. You can read more from Reuters here.X.ai sues former engineer for allegedly taking trade secrets to OpenAI. Elon Musk’s AI startup x.AI has filed suit against former engineer Xuechen Li, alleging he stole trade secrets about its Grok chatbot and took them to his new job at OpenAI, Reuters reported. Li was not immediately available to respond to the allegations. The lawsuit follows other legal battles Musk has launched against OpenAI and Apple, accusing them of monopolistic practices and straying from OpenAI’s original mission.Anthropic says it will begin training AI models on user chats unless they opt out. The move is a major shift in data privacy policies for the AI model maker, which also said it was extending the length of time it retained user data to five years. Users can opt out by September 28. Some users and data privacy experts criticized the decision, noting that the design of Anthropic’s “Accept” button could cause many to agree without noticing the toggle that controls data sharing. Others speculated that Anthropic was making the move because it is running out of other ways to obtain enough data to train models that will compete with OpenAI and Google. Enterprise users of Anthropic’s Claude model, as well as government, education, or API users, are not affected. Anthropic says it filters sensitive information and does not sell user data to third parties. You can read more from The Verge here. More evidence emerges that AI may be leading to job losses. Last week in Eye on AI, I covered research from economists at Stanford University whose research indicated that AI was leading to job losses, particularly among entry level employees, in professions that were highly-exposed to AI. This week, more evidence emerges from another well-designed study, this one carried out by the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Although this study did not look at whether younger and older workers were affected differently, it did examine the link between occupations that had adopted AI most intensively and job losses and found a distinct correlation. The impacts were greatest in occupations that used mathematics and computing intensively, such as software development, and much less in blue collar work and fields such as healthcare that were less prone to being automated with AI. You can read the St. Louis Fed study here. Both the Stanford and St. Louis Fed research suggest that job losses from the implementation of AI are likely to be concentrated in some sectors, and not economy-wide. That said, as good as these studies are, I still think both fail to disentangle the effects of AI from the possible effects of the unwinding of the tech hiring boom that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, many large companies bulked up their software development and IT departments. Major tech firms such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft hired tens of thousands of new employees, sometimes hiring people before there was even any work for them to do just in order to prevent rivals from snapping up the same coders. Then, when the pandemic ended and it was clear that some ideas, such as Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, were not going to pan out, these same companies laid off tens of thousands of workers. I don’t think I’ve seen research yet that can separate the technology sector’s shedding of jobs created during the pandemic from the impact of AI. But I am sure someone is working on it and when they crack that nut, we’ll definitely report it here. Sept. 8-10: Fortune Brainstorm Tech, Park City, Utah. Apply to attend here.

Preventing 'parasocial' chatbots.’ It’s increasingly clear that chatbots can encourage ‘parasocial’ relationships, where a user develops a harmful emotional attachment to the chatbot or the chatbot encourages the user to engage in self-harm of some kind. The parents of several teenagers who took their own lives after conversations with chatbots are now suing AI companies, saying they did not do enough to prevent chatbots from encouraging self-harm. And, short of suicides, there is other mounting evidence of people developing harmful chatbot dependencies.Well, a new benchmark from researchers at Hugging Face, called INTIMA (Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark), aims to evaluate LLMs on their “companionship-seeking” behavior. The benchmark looks at 31 distinct behaviors across four different categories of interaction and 368 prompts. Testing Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4, researchers found that models more often reinforced companionship than maintained boundaries, though they varied: for instance, Claude was more likely to resist personification, while Gemma reinforced intimacy. You can read the Hugging Face paper here.At the same time, researchers from Aligned AI, an Oxford startup I’ve covered before, published research showing that one LLM can be used to successfully screen the outputs of another LLM for parasocial behavior and then prompt that chatbot to steer the conversation in a less harmful direction. Aligned AI wanted to show that major AI model producers could implement such systems simply, if they wished (but that they were too often choosing to “optimize for user engagement” instead.)

A man in his 40s has been arrested after cocaine with an estimated value of €140,000 was seized in Dublin. Around two kilograms of the drug was seized in Blackrock by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, DMR East Divisional Drug Unit and Revenue officers. The man is currently detained at a garda station in Dublin under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996. The drugs have been sent for analysis and investigations are ongoing. Revenue said in a statement that the seizure is part of its "ongoing work targeting smuggling and shadow economy activity". "If businesses, or members of the public have any information, they can contact Revenue in confidence on Confidential Phone Number 1800 295 295," it added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former scout leader died by suicide day before trial on sex abuse charges, coroner finds

Time Published: 2025-09-02T17:53:12Z

A verdict of suicide has been recorded at an inquest following the death of a former scout leader who had been accused of the historical sexual abuse of boys in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s. Neville Kearns (69) died in a single-vehicle collision in Churchtown, south Dublin, shortly after 6am on April 7th last year. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He had been due to stand trial the following day on 113 counts including charges of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape and attempted rape. These related to allegations, made by five complainants, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. Dublin coroner Dr Clare Keane recorded the verdict on Tuesday, noting the cause of death was thoracic and musculoskeletal injuries consistent with a collision. The inquest heard that when emergency services arrived at the scene they found a red 2002 Toyota Hiace van had crashed into a tree on the wrong side of Churchtown Road Upper. Garda John Culleton said the weather was dry on the morning in question and there was no evidence “whatsoever” of braking on the road. Damage to the vehicle was “concentrated” on the driver’s side, he said. The inquest heard how Kearns was not wearing a seat belt. Emergency services had to remove the door to get Kearns from the vehicle. Paramedics performed CPR, but Kearns was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.34am, the inquest heard. [ The Dublin scout leader who died a day before his trial and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Gda David O’Brien inspected the van after the crash. He said, despite how old the vehicle was, it was “serviceable” and the tyres and brakes were in “good condition”. Gda Culleton said the evidence indicated Kearns most likely turned the van “towards the tree” and the damage caused to the tree indicated the vehicle was “travelling well above the speed limit”. At the time of his death, Kearns was a caretaker at Edenvale Apartments, a gated apartment complex on Grange Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin. He lived in a campervan on the grounds, the inquest heard. The van involved in the collision was a different vehicle to the campervan in which he lived. Biba van Belle, Kearns’s niece, told the inquest she removed his personal belongings from the campervan and a storage facility at Edenvale Apartments following his death. Among the belongings were documents which were later handed over to gardaí. Ms van Belle last spoke to her uncle more than 20 years before his death, the inquest heard. Sergeant Robert Scott from Blackrock Garda station said he spoke to a number of people who had contact with Kearns prior to his death and it appeared Kearns was “trying to get affairs in order”. Sgt Scott told the inquest the documents found in the campervan and shed included a note in which Kearns said he was “tired of it all” and “must bring closure to it all”. A will was found on a table in the campervan, Sgt Scott said, as well as documents showing Kearns’s funeral had already been paid for. These receipts dated from 2020 when gardaí first contacted Kearns about the abuse allegations, the inquest heard. Sgt Scott said gardaí believed the location of the crash was significant as it was close to where Kearns held unofficial scout meetings decades earlier. He said there was “no third-party involvement or anything of a suspicious nature” related to Kearns’s death. He said he believed Kearns had taken his own life. Detective Sergeant Barry O’Connor identified Kearns’s body the following day at the mortuary at St Columcille’s Hospital in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin. Det Sgt O’Connor told the inquest he had met Kearns several times before the man’s death. [ PODCAST: Now he can be named - the Dublin scout leader and the men who accuse him of abuseOpens in new window ] Kearns was a member of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the 1970s prior to setting up his own unofficial scouting group. One alleged victim told The Irish Times in June how Kearns’s death was “his final act of cowardice”. Imagining what he would have said to Kearns in court, he stated: “You had the opportunity to face up to what you had done, but you chose not to and so you have left a despicable legacy of abuse over decades.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Anthropic Hits $183 Billion Valuation After Series F Funding

AI research company Anthropic has secured $13 billion in Series F funding to reach a $183 billion valuation, highlighting investor confidence in its accelerating growth and product strength. The funding round is led by ICONIQ alongside key contributions from Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, and makes Anthropic one of the most valuable startups in the world. Among the backers are Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, and Insight Partners, among others. The company’s financial performance has surged in recent months. At the beginning of the year, Anthropic reported an annual run-rate revenue of around one billion dollars. By August, that figure had soared to more than 5 billion dollars, a 5x increase in less than 9 months. Anthropic also revealed that it now serves more than 300,000 business customers. The number of large enterprise clients generating over $100,000 in run-rate revenue has grown nearly 7 times in the past year alone. Claude Code, a tool aimed at developers, has emerged as one of its most successful products, generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue. The Series F raise follows a Series E round earlier this year, when Anthropic collected $3.5 billion at a valuation of $61.5 billion. The leap to a $183 billion valuation in just a few months underscores how quickly confidence in the company has grown. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, the company has consistently emphasized building systems that are reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values. With the new capital, Anthropic plans to expand its enterprise footprint, accelerate research into AI safety, and extend its international reach.

Iconiq co-led the round with Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to the company’s blog post. Other backers include a string of institutional investors, VCs, sovereign wealth funds, private equity, and asset managers, such as Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, Insight Partners, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, and more. “We are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,” Anthropic CFO Krishna Rao said in the post. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.” Anthropic last raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation in March 2025. This latest fundraise comes after reports that Anthropic was nearing a deal to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in funding at a $170 billion valuation. It also follows impressive growth from the AI startup, which reported a jump in annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion over the course of 2025 amid accelerated API usage and enterprise adoption. “Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year,” the company said in the company blog post. Claude Code is also a developer favorite and one of the main impetuses for Anthropic’s growth. The company said its vibe-coding product already generates more than $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in the last three months. But maintaining that growth and competing with rivals like OpenAI, Cursor, and others requires more money, as its CEO Dario Amodei recently confessed in a memo, reported by Wired. He said he wasn’t “thrilled” about taking money from sovereign wealth funds of dictatorial governments, but that it’s difficult to run a business by excluding “bad people” from investing.

Title: 4 ways to play the market as stocks enter their worst stretch of the year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-tips-recommendations-outlook-sp500-equity-playbook-september-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-02T16:09:51Z

It hasn't been an amazing start to the month for stocks. The market is kicking off September in the red, with the Dow dropping more than 500 points on Monday as investors cashed in some of their recent gains and fretted over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But that would be considered par for the course for the stock market, which has historically struggled during the month of September — commonly referred to as the market's weakest month of the year. Historically, the S&P 500 has shed an average 0.7% over the month of September for the last 75 years. In months when the benchmark index lost, the average drawdown for the month was 3.8%, according to an analysis from LPL Financial. But that isn't to say there isn't room for investors to get into or stay in the market, so long as they're willing to stomach some volatility. "Seasonal data represents the typical climate for stocks but not the weather," Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL financial, wrote in a recent client note. "And currently, the weather for the S&P 500 is filled with blue skies and record highs. When accounting for momentum and trend, which we believe is much-needed context, September doesn't look so bad." Here are four ways traders should be looking at the month ahead, according to the combined recommendations from seven investing pros: A stock sell-off this month could be your friend, if you're willing to look at the decline as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In a note to clients on Tuesday, strategists at Morgan Stanley said they remained "buyers of dips should they come" in the coming months, despite weak seasonal trends for stocks. That's partly because the bank doubts the market has fully priced in the bullish impact of the Fed's expected rate cuts, with central bankers most likely teeing up a 25-basis-point cut at the end of the month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "We push back on the idea that rate cuts are already priced as equity returns tend to be strong during rate cutting cycles, and rate-sensitive areas like small caps are barely off the relative lows," a team led by Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote. Other forecasters on Wall Street have also expressed faith in the market's long-running upward trend. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel said he believed the bull market still had further to go, pointing to incoming Fed rate cuts, strong corporate earnings, and historically normal valuations in the S&P 500 when excluding the Magnificent Seven companies. "September being historically really the worst month of the year. Listen, you know, certainly we could have a pullback," he said. "I still think the bull trends are intact." Now could also be a good time for investors to diversify their portfolio in the bond market, strategists at Société Générale wrote in a note last week. The European bank pointed to a thinning gap between the performance of equities and bonds in recent months. A separate analysis from Apollo Global Management found that investment grade corporate bonds and short-term US Treasurys had been outperforming expected returns in the S&P 500 in recent years, based on the index's forward earnings. "Diversification into bonds is becoming beneficial again, especially in the US," SocGen wrote. In its latest weekly commentary, BlackRock also said it had a strategic, five-year call on bonds. "We are overweight short-term inflation-linked bonds as US tariffs could push up inflation," strategists wrote in a note last month. "The bottom line is that fixed income remains more attractive than the implied yield levels in public equity markets at the moment," Torsten Sløk, Apollo's chief economist, wrote last week. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, said she liked areas of the market that were considered to be less expensive compared to the broader S&P 500 index. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, she highlighted housing in particular, given that activity in the sector is showing some signs of ramping up. Existing home sales in the US crept up 2% on a seasonally adjusted year-over-year basis in July, thanks partly to the small improvement in housing affordability, the National Association of Realtors said. Housing stocks have also tended to do well at a time when earnings across the broader market have struggled, Link noted. "I am a big housing bull. I think that we're just starting to see a recovery in housing," she said. "We have maybe a rocky six weeks. So I think you take advantage of that," she added of the broader seasonal weakness in markets. "I think the fourth quarter is going to be very strong. And so I think you want to be buying some of the volatility." Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said he was favoring the market's leading large-cap names as stocks head into their historical period of weakness. That's because there's potential for inflation to climb higher, which means the Fed may cut rates less than markets currently expect. Anticipated rate cuts are a major reason why small and mid-cap stocks have rallied in recent weeks. "What does that mean? Well, I stick with who brought you to the dance. Those large caps," he told CNBC last week, adding that he also had exposure to areas like industrials and financials. "We're not overweight small- and mid-caps here." "You look at the kind of leadership, I love it. What's even lagging, like even more," he added, pointing to large-cap laggards in areas like consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Stocks also had strong momentum heading out of August, which is a positive sign for equities even amid seasonal weakness, Detrick said. At the end of the second-to-last week of the month, 90% of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were in the green. That's an extremely rare occurrence in financial markets, with only 12 instances of that happening since 1980, he said. "So even if we have a little seasonal weakness, after a 30% rally, I think it's going to be contained," Detrick said of any coming pullback. Jump to

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 2, 2025)

Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:53:06Z
Full Content:
The explosion of competition in semi-liquid funds could lead to fee compression, according to FundFire. The ETF market is becoming flooded with “slop”, writes ETF.com. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 2, 2025 What’s Next for Semi-Liquid Funds? Fee Compression “Managers rushing to develop alts strategies for the advisor market have not only been chasing vast sums of high-net-worth capital but also the prospect of higher fees than they can generate from mutual funds or private vehicles. And managers have mostly found investors willing to pay the base fees for semi-liquid alts funds.” (FundFire) ETF Slop: How Wall Street Flooded the Market With Gimmick Funds “Just as AI slop means endless articles, videos, and posts that are easy to create and empty of substance, ETF slop means endless new tickers that deliver little of lasting value. So far in 2025, issuers have launched nearly 700 ETFs, already close to last year’s record with four months still left to go. With more than 4,600 ETFs now listed in the U.S., about 15% of the entire market has been born this year alone. And much of it is slop.” (ETF.com) What Investors Need to Know About Private Assets Managers “Traditional public market asset managers have partnered with alternatives managers to develop strategies. For the managers, it seems like a win-win situation: Public market asset managers get quicker and probably cheaper access to private asset deals and operational insight, while private market managers get an “in” to public market asset managers’ existing retail or wealth channel distribution networks.” (Morningstar) Vanguard Hires Nuveen’s Stout to Head Private Markets Strategy “Vanguard Group hired an outsider to head its strategy for private markets, signaling that Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji intends to make a bigger push into the asset class.” (Bloomberg) Why You Should Pay Attention to Active ETFs “Active managers long held out on ETFs because of their daily transparency. Some companies went to great lengths to create nontransparent ETFs for this reason. But the benefit of opacity is unclear for investors.” (Morningstar) Why Apollo CEO Marc Rowan says the traditional investing model is ‘broken’ “With the stock market increasingly driven by passive investing and indexing, and dominated by a handful of mega-tech stocks, investors seeking diversification will need to start turning to the rapidly expanding private markets, Rowan told CNBC.” (CNBC) Alts Demand Driving Up Specialist Pay, Divisional Head Hires “Asset managers are ponying up more to hire product specialists as demand for alternative investments intensifies – and they're bringing on additional divisional leaders to support the growing mix of specialists and generalists. Average total compensation for advisor-facing specialists reached $322,563 in the second quarter of 2025, up nearly 13% from a year earlier, according to data from Cerulli Associates.” (FundFire) US sliding towards 1930s-style autocracy, warns Ray Dalio “Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned Donald Trump’s America is drifting into 1930s-style autocratic politics — and said other investors are too scared of the president to speak up.” (Financial Times) How BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are bringing Wall Street’s hottest asset class to 401(k)s “Wall Street’s largest firms are championing a new cause. They are bringing alternative assets — once reserved for the ultra-wealthy — to the portfolios of individual investors.” (CNBC) REITs Own 570,000 Properties in the U.S. “Data centers had the largest year-over-year increase, up 15% from 2023 to 352 properties at the end of 2024. Retail, storage, and apartment property types all had increases of 30% or more since 2018, with retail up 39%, storage up 33%, and apartment up 30%. Retail also had the second highest annual increase, up 9%.” (Nareit) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: Prospective Thames Water rescuers make big promise

A consortium of Thames Water creditors is seeking the agreement of the regulator for its updated operational investment proposals to avert the prospect of being wiped out, should their rescue bid fail. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 September 2025 00:12, UK The group of Thames Water lenders aiming to rescue the company have set out plans for £20.5bn of investment to bolster performance. The proposals, submitted to the regulator for consideration, include commitments to spending £9.4bn on sewage and water assets over the next five years, up 45% on current levels, to prevent spills and leaks respectively. Of this, £3.9bn would go towards the worst performing sewage treatment sites following a series of fines against Thames Water, and other major operators, over substandard storm overflow systems. It said this would be achieved at the 2025-30 bill levels already in place, so no further increases would be needed, but it continued to argue that leniency over poor performance will be needed to effect the turnaround. The creditors have named their consortium London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Thames is on the brink of nationalisation because of the scale of its financial troubles, with debts above £17bn. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of oversight, is looking at the operational plan separately to its proposed capital structure. The latter is expected to be revealed later this month. Sky News revealed on Monday that the consortium was to offer an additional £1bn-plus sweetener in a bid to persuade Ofwat and the government to back the rescue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mike McTighe, the chairman designate of London & Valley Water, said: "Over the next 10 years the investment we will channel into Thames Water's network will make it one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country. "Our core focus will be on improving performance for customers, maintaining the highest standards of drinking water, reducing pollution and overcoming the many other challenges Thames Water faces. "This turnaround has the opportunity to transform essential services for 16 million customers, clean up our waterways and rebuild public trust."

A major challenge for the consortium is convincing officials that it has the experience and people behind it to meet the demands of running a water company of Thames Water's size, serving about a quarter of the country's population.

Title: Texas Suit V. Blackrock Et Al Could Undermine Trump’s Energy Agenda
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/02/texas-suit-v-blackrock-et-al-could-undermine-trumps-energy-agenda/

ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. In a move demonstrating that big oil companies aren’t the only targets of energy-related lawsuits, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas AG Ken Paxton recently sued major investment firms including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The complaint, filed last December in a Texas federal court, alleges that the defendants illegally colluded to buy up stock in various coal companies and force them to lower output via implementation of internal ESG-focused policies. Mr. Paxton said in a press release introducing the lawsuit that the big investment firms have created a “cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” adding, “their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But U.S. coal prices have dropped dramatically since 2023, and overall coal production has been in decline throughout the 21st century. Despite coal’s decline, America’s mineral energy renaissance has transformed our country’s outlook, enhancing its energy security in the process. Once heavily dependent on foreign suppliers to meet demand, last year the U.S. produced more mineral energy than ever before – and output is projected to increase further this year. This extraordinary turnaround is in large part the result of free markets being allowed to do what they do best: compete. This is certainly the case in the oil and gas business, where thousands of producers ranging from small mom-and-pop operators to the biggest major integrated companies in the world compete in a vibrant marketplace. It has even remained true in the coal industry despite an array of command-and-control interventions enacted during both the Obama and Biden presidencies. Mr. Paxton and some of the Republican AGs who have signed onto the plaintiff coalition have been outspoken proponents of President Donald Trump and his efforts to reverse much of the Biden and Obama regulatory morass. So, regardless of the merits of the complaint, it is at least interesting that the group’s lawsuit proposes a big government solution. That proposed remedy asks that that the government force these asset managers to divest their holdings in coal companies entirely, a move that could strip the industry of nearly $18 billion in capital. That could be ruinous to a sector which has been in decline for decades. It would also present real trouble for Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s goal of delaying planned retirements of more than 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, which he discussed in President Trump’s August 26 cabinet meeting. After all, it costs real money to pay for the upkeep and operations of that many coal power plants. Somebody has to foot the bill, and it won’t be the federal government. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as Energy Secretary throughout the first Trump presidency from 2017-2021, called the lawsuit "misguided" last month in a Washington Times op-ed. Perry warned that a decision for the plaintiffs would likely undermine Trump's energy agenda, calling the case “not conservative. That’s not pro-business. And it’s certainly not pro-energy dominance.” Surely, there must be more constructive ways to debate energy policy. In fact, the last election served in many ways as a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration’s aggressive green agenda – one that Trump and his cabinet officials say made a mess of America’s energy security. Should the plaintiff states prevail in this case, what would that mean for the many oil and gas companies who adopted many of the same ESG-focused internal policies which these coal companies implemented in their efforts to adapt to the political and market realities of the moment to maximize investor returns? Those companies were advised every day of every week for years to move in that direction by an array of major advisory firms for whose advice they paid millions of dollars. This kind of litigation also raises the specter of the tables being reversed whenever the political pendulum swings back in the other direction, which it inevitably will do. The resulting tit-for-tat governance might chill investment and raise the cost of capital at precisely the time when large-scale energy investments are most needed. During the 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to reinvigorate “beautiful, clean coal” as part of an all-of-the-above energy plan – a laudable goal to meet America’s rapidly growing energy needs. Shoring up resilience and reliability on the nation’s power grids by ensuring the maintenance of adequate 24/7 baseload generating capacity is a major piece of that agenda. Secretary Wright and other Trump officials believe coal still has a big role to play in that space. Achieving the President’s vision will require serious investment by the private sector as government subsidies are gradually removed from the equation, and much of that capital investment must be provided by the defendant firms in this case. Policymakers should be working to unleash capital markets, not jam them up. But, despite that reality, the Trump Justice Department’s antitrust division and Federal Trade Commission tacitly endorsed the lawsuit in July with the filing of a statement of interest, saying the actions by the defendants could reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. This begs the question of who the agencies believe will step in to pony up $18 billion in new capital to fund the ongoing operations of the 100 gw of coal plants Sec. Wright wants to keep in operation if the government forces this mass divestiture. It isn’t as if alternative investors are clamoring at the gates to invest in the coal business these days. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this litigation targeting Blackrock and other big investment houses, it serves to vividly illustrate the complexities endemic to investing big money in the energy business in the United States today. None of this is simple or easy: If it was, everybody would be doing it.

Title: St John of God Brothers to end involvement in hospital and healthcare group as new group chief is announced

New CEO Jerry Dempsey St John of God religious order Brothers are to step away from its health and hospital organisation as a new group chief executive was announced today. Jerry Dempsey will take over the St John of God Hospitaller Services Group (SJOG HSG). It includes the St John of God Hospital in Dublin and St John of God Community Services, which deliver intellectual disability and community mental health services at various locations throughout Ireland. It was announced today that Mr Dempsey will bring 25 years of executive management experience with a background spanning healthcare services, pharmaceuticals and environmental services in Ireland, the UK, and the USA. New CEO Jerry Dempsey Today's News in 90 seconds - September 2nd He has “extensive experience leading mission-driven organisations in regulated multi-stakeholder environments where trust, compliance and service quality are paramount", according to a spokesperson. “Previous roles held include Managing Director of Greenstar, CEO of Ashfield Healthcare USA and Chief Commercial Officer of healthcare and life sciences company Complete Laboratory Solutions. Jerry has led organisations through periods of significant growth and transformation while successfully balancing commercial acumen and financial sustainability underpinned by a strong person-centred approach,” they said. “His breadth of experience positions him to professionally progress the ongoing transformation of St John of God Hospitaller Services Group and its affiliated entities, while championing the enduring values of compassion, hospitality and respect that are central to the mission and purpose of St John of God.” A spokesperson said the announcement coincides with further changes in board membership arrangements in line with ongoing governance reforms. The formation of SJOG HSG commenced in 2006 when the Hospitaller Order of St John of God (the Order) began planning for a future where the Brothers would no longer lead the mission, due to advancing age and declining vocations. A series of developments over the intervening years has led to a planned reduction of Order involvement across both the operations and governance of the SJOG entities, they said. “The next phase of the ongoing transition process will see the remaining Irish and UK Brothers now stepping down from the SJOG HSG and SJOG Malawi Boards and transitioning off all remaining entity Boards by the end of 2025. This will mark a pivotal moment in the organisation's evolution, entrusting leadership and governance fully in the hands of committed lay people,” they added. Mr Dempsey said: "I am honoured to take up the role of Group CEO at this transformative time for the St John of God Group. The Order has laid a remarkable foundation for the task ahead with over a century and half of dedicated service and leadership. "I am confident we can continue to fulfill the mission of Saint John of God by building a cohesive, resilient and sustainable future, adapting to emerging requirements and meeting unmet need while delivering impactful, compassionate care to those in need. Ensuring the dignity and well-being of the people we are entrusted to support and helping them to reach their full potential, remains our central focus." Dr Tony Hanna, chair of the board added: “We are delighted to confirm Jerry Dempsey’s appointment as Group CEO. He brings a wealth of professional experience and corporate expertise to this role as we enter a new era in the Group’s development. We acknowledge the invaluable contribution the Order has made over the past 150 years in helping the most vulnerable in our society. We will continue to lead the services with the utmost respect and commitment to that legacy.” In June, Aidan Clohessy, a former school principal was convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30 year period and jailed for four years. He was principal of ST Augustine’s School in Blackrock from the early 1970s to 1993. He entered the St John of God religious order in 1958. In a statement, the Order of Saint John of God said it has “long recognised the need and desire for lay people to exercise greater leadership roles in the governance of the works and services of the West European Province, which includes Ireland”. The Order also recognised that there was a desire of lay people to play an active and leadership role in promoting, expanding and furthering the mission and that lay people would bring "particular and valued experience and expertise in meeting the needs of people and also enhance overall governance”. To support this vision, and mindful of the declining number of Brothers and their age profiles, a process was initiated with the primary aim of ensuring the continuation into the future, of the mission and work of the Order of Saint John of God, it added.

Title: Rising star catch-up: Anna Ashurov details her journey from Goldman Sachs to Anheuser-Busch to BlackRock

Time Published: 2025-09-02T09:02:01Z
Full Content:
Anna Ashurov has been busy. A 2018 member of Business Insider's rising stars list, Ashurov has changed companies twice since her stint at Goldman Sachs, going from the investment bank to the world's largest beer brewer and then to the world's largest asset manager, where she's worked since 2021. Ashurov now oversees growth strategy and client relationships for Aladdin, BlackRock's widely used risk analytics and portfolio management tech. She told Business Insider, she's focused on "driving growth holistically" instead of structuring deals and advising clients. We caught up with her on her career changes, and she shared advice for those considering a big leap. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. BI: What has your career been like since Business Insider featured you on our 2018 rising stars list? AA: When I spoke to your colleagues last, I was at Goldman, in leveraged finance and capital markets. I purposefully wanted to be more on the operating side, and I transitioned into a role within the financing division at Goldman — it was essentially a chief of staff for the financing division. And that gave me a perspective on the operating side within the firm. From there, I was hired by AB InBev to lead their commercial strategy and transformation. And that was essentially my introduction to being on the operating side, leading commercial strategy, leading market build-out. We had a ton of interesting work that we were doing in our beyond beer strategy, doing some interesting acquisitions. And as I was getting deeper into the operating field, I had an inbound from BlackRock to join the Aladdin business, which to me was absolutely fascinating. And I decided to make that move. Ultimately, what drove me or drew me to BlackRock was its unique position at the intersection of finance, technology, and innovation. I've always been interested in how technology can transform industries. So to me, that was a perfect opportunity to join the fintech world, and I've been here since then. It's been a fun ride. This story is part of a new series catching up with finance pros we once spotlighted as Rising Stars of Wall Street to see where their careers have taken them. See all of our past Rising Stars lists here. BI: What core skills from your time at Goldman do you still use today? AA: My background in finance has been foundational for my current role, and I even think in my role at AB InBev. So early on, I built deep relationships with institutional clients, which taught me how to understand their needs and different challenges, and to deliver solutions. That sort of client-centric perspective is what I brought with me, and that is essential to creating long-term value. At AB InBev, I had the opportunity to drive commercial strategy and lead those transformational initiatives, so that also gave me the hands-on experience of aligning business priorities and delivering operational execution that I brought here as well. I had to learn all about technology, which I haven't done before, but I think some of the foundational skills and being a client-facing executive are something that I'd ultimately apply anywhere. BI: You've been tasked, in an operating role, with growing brands that many would consider to be the leaders in their space. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, while AB InBev is the world's largest brewer. How do you grow established brands while retaining what got them to this point? AA: It's easier to do when the organization has foundational cultural values, right? AB InBev is a big conglomerate, but at the same time, it was absolutely flat in terms of structure. I had direct access to Michel Doukeris, who's the CEO of the organization, and direct access to the head of strategy — the organization was so agile and nimble that you were able to make decisions and drive change. Same thing at BlackRock. In order for you to be able to actually impact the organization, impact its growth, impact the strategy, and make the difference that you are there to make, you need to have the proper cultural foundation to be able to actually effectuate that change. Both of the organizations have that. BI: You've now worked in different industries, including some known for long hours and grueling schedules. Have you kept a similar routine as far as your day-to-day as you shifted between jobs? Is there something you've kept the same even as your roles have changed? AA: I do read during my commute. That's actually probably the only time when I have time to read. So I love when I have like an hour-and-a-half commute, I read both ways or I listen to podcasts, but often I read. I like fiction, I like murder mysteries. That's my time to decompress and release and do something different, because I am kind of on all the time. BI: What advice would you give someone who is thinking of making a big career move? Maybe someone who has had some success in their career but is thinking of changing industries or firms, as someone who has taken that leap. AA: If I reflect on my journey and look back at my career, the one sort of constant is that I've grown through change. Do not be afraid of change. For me, it's always been important to not become complacent and to continue to feel challenged. It's important to continue pushing yourself. Jump to

Title: Labor group holds first Labor Day parade in Boston: ‘Workers are fed up with billionaires’

Union members rallied in Boston Monday during a Labor Day parade hosted by the Greater Boston Labor Council. Organizers cast the event as a “historic display of worker solidarity” that replaced the city’s customary Labor Day breakfast at the Park Plaza. GBLC President Darlene Lombos said the parade was “a statement.” “Workers are fed up with billionaires who hijack our democracy while pushing brutal cuts to the very programs that create jobs and keep our communities strong — everything from infrastructure investment to education and health care,” Lombos said in a statement. Political figures from across Massachusetts joined the event, including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Gov. Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. The march started on Boston Common near the State House, and then continued to the first public school in the country on School Street, the BlackRock corporate offices on State Street, Faneuil Hall on Congress Street, a site run by SEIU Local 32BJ on Sudbury Street, the JFK Federal Building on Sudbury Street, and Boston City Hall Plaza. The march in Boston coincided with a number of Labor Day-related events happening across the country, including a rally in front of Trump Tower in New York.

Title: BlackRock has finally come for our utilities

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/01/2025 1:21:40 PM PDT by E. Pluribus Unum BlackRock has finally come for our utilities.Here’s this, from a new article by Katya Schwenk at Jacobin:BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has its tentacles in all facets of American life. The behemoth is buying up grocery brands, dental practices, apartment buildings, and nursing homes. But the opaque industry of private equity has mostly stayed away from electric utilities, the regulated companies that supply power to homes and businesses, because they often don’t yield quick returns.That’s changing. Last year, the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and a Canadian pension fund announced a $6.2 billion deal to buy Minnesota Power….That deal faced tremendous pushback, and is not yet official, but here’s where things get really conspiratorial: after a judge issued a heavyhanded ruling against the acquisition, unions and “clean energy” advocacy organizations have come out of the woodwork to support the BlackRock takeover—Schwenk writes that when the proposed deal was announced, BlackRock executives “put the climate transition at the center of their pitch.” The “clean energy” groups with their “climate crisis” boogeyman strike again.Schwenk also uncovers some rather incestuous connections too:In at least one instance, union comments bear the fingerprints of an attorney working for BlackRock, document metadata shows.And:One of these [clean energy] groups is currently advertising a benefit event sponsored by Minnesota Power and the law firm representing BlackRock in the deal.And, it’s not just BlackRock. Another big player on Wall Street, Blackstone, is also in on the game, which recently announced its plans to acquire “a major electric utility in Texas and New Mexico” if permitted to do so.So why are these global investment firms turning their attention to our energy suppliers?

But I have to say, the way the 21t century is going, I have serious doubts. I want individual Americans to own a home. That’s the American Dream. It’s hard to do that now, in part because BlackRock seems to own most of the real estate in the US. You will own nothing. And now BlackRock will own power companies, apartment buildings, and who knows what else. If individuals lack the means to own basic things like their own home or their own business, then we have nothing like capitalism. We own nothing, and they will force us to declare how happy we are about the whole thing. Where has the American Thinker been? Blackrock has been positioning themselves to do this over the last few months. These Blackrock bastards are evil. Black Rock needs to be broken up and dismantled. What we have today sure is not a free market. BlackRock isn’t a private equity firm—it’s a massive asset manager and fiduciary. It invests on behalf of clients through mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts. I don’t like BlackRock either, but let’s keep the critique accurate. Mislabeling it only weakens the argument. They have the voting rights of the stocks they own on behalf of other entitities and thereby control their boards of directors. That’s why all the corporations went woke. It worked for Enron in California, didn’t it? “In at least one instance, union comments bear the fingerprints of an attorney working for BlackRock, document metadata shows.” There’s a clown here who claims that labor unions are HARMLESS. We’re in bad enough shape now, and unless unions are sent to the ash heap of history, we’re TOAST. https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/leadership/larry-fink Black Rock, Larry Fink and the World Economy Forum. “I’ve always been a free market guy.” Huge but subtle difference between the “Free Market” and “Capitalism”. Under Capitalism/Federal Reserve System, the politically connected have access to unlimited amount of cheap or free money. In short the underlying money system is not honest and puts honest people at a huge disadvantage. Free Markets Yes, but we seriously need to reform this corrupt system or one day we’ll end up like the Roman empire where the richest man in the empire bought the government. The army then got rid of him. I don’t understand an asset management company that drives down the value of their assets. I.E. Cracker Barrel. I live in an area of Kentucky that has been labelled the 2nd most impoverished voting district in the nation. The main power supplier just announced a 15% increase in power costs to the public. If Blackrock or others buy them up (if they haven’t already) I can’t even imagine what they would try to do to powercosts here. I can handle it since I’m a well-compensated engineer. But MANY here won’t be able to handle it. This is terrible. I thought there were laws against monopolies. The entire Woke problem with corporations isn't just due to fiduciaries like Blackrock.

Title: Ethereum Over Bitcoin? Matt Hougan Says Institutions Sometimes Start With ETH

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has stated that a growing number of professional investors are skipping Bitcoin and turning directly to Ethereum as their first crypto investment. This has long been regarded as the entry point into digital assets, and Bitcoin is now sharing the spotlight with Ethereum. In Ripdoteth’s update on X, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has revealed on live that an interesting trend is emerging. He claims that many professional investors are bypassing Bitcoin and going directly to Ethereum, whose utility in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and Web3 applications is increasingly drawing institutional capital. The reason he explains is rooted in how institutions already think about portfolio construction. According to the expert, most professional investors don’t actually own gold. This is because Gold is considered a niche asset, with perhaps only 15% to 20% of institutions holding it, while the vast majority of 80% or more invest in stocks and bonds. Since Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, its appeal is limited for many professionals who never allocated to gold in the first place. “A lot of people look at Bitcoin like it’s digital gold. I don’t own gold, but I do own technologies,” Hougan stated. ETH fits naturally into the portfolios of those who already allocate to innovative technologies. With tokenization and stablecoins gaining traction, he expects institutional flow into ETH to continue building momentum. While institutions see Ethereum as the exposure to the technological backbone of a digital economy, Wall Street FOMO has hit historic levels, as the US institutional appetite for ETH is reaching unprecedented heights. Crypto trader Bull Theory has highlighted that in August 2025 alone, Ethereum Spot ETFs purchased $3.87 billion worth of ETH, driven almost entirely by professional investors chasing long-term exposure. Leading the charge is $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which allocated $3.38 billion worth of ETH and $707 million in Bitcoin, highlighting a clear preference for ETH over BTC. This wave of institutional buying pushed Ethereum to new all-time highs in August. Importantly, the majority of these purchases are intended for long-term holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and supporting sustained price momentum. If ETH closes above $4,630, it will mark the highest monthly close since the 2021 bull run. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transaction volumes surged past $320 billion on-chain, reflecting broad engagement across decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, staking continues to attract Wall Street attention, with nearly 36 million ETH, which is 29% of the total circulating supply, now locked in staking contracts. With 3% staking rewards, Ethereum provides institutional investors with a steady dividend, making it more appealing for long-term portfolios.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: “No More Bears”: Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin Charging Toward $1 Million Milestone
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/no-more-bitcoin-bears-saylor-says/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T13:00:04Z

The current bearish wave seems to have significantly disrupted the bullish action of Bitcoin, which has forced the largest cryptocurrency asset to revisit downside targets like the $108,000 price mark. While this action has triggered speculations about a potential bear market phase, Michael Saylor’s latest statement suggests that this period of volatility could be laying the groundwork for a notable surge. Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has dropped a bombshell on the ongoing bearish period and the future price target for Bitcoin. During an interview on Bloomberg, the chairman declared that the bear market is not coming back and BTC’s price could rise to a million-dollar value. Saylor, who has long defended Bitcoin as the best digital gold substitute and ultimate store of value, thinks that the cryptocurrency is the cornerstone of the contemporary financial system. This status is being cemented by its increasing institutional adoption, tightening supply dynamics, and growing demand worldwide. In the interview shared by Trending Bitcoin, the chairman emphasized that the market has gone past the bearish phase, indicating that the market is entering a new era. During these moments of heightened volatility, Saylor believes that BTC is heading to $1 million if it does not fall to zero. The founder has attributed this anticipated price target to several key factors, especially in the political landscape. According to Saylor, BTC has secured notable support from US President Donald Trump, the Cabinet, Scott Bessent, Paul Atkins, among others, as the crypto king matures into a global reserve asset. As BTC gains mainstream recognition, Saylor is confident that banks, particularly in the US, will eventually start to custody Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin has gone through its riskiest period, and the accounting has been corrected. BTC’s supply continues to shrink, with only 450 BTC available for sale each day by natural sellers, also regarded as minors. When these coins are bought at a rapid rate, demand for BTC is likely to increase, and its price will grow sharply. Institutions are significantly demonstrating interest in BTC as they set out to add the asset to their treasuries. Saylor revealed that these big firms, such as BlackRock, are acquiring a huge portion of the daily natural supply of BTC. Considering these factors, Saylor remains confident that BTC’s price is moving higher, hitting between $500,000 and $1 million. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy,” the founder added. However, in the event of a bearish phase, he claims that BTC could crash to the $250,000 range. Saylor’s latest remarks reflect Strategy’s robust interest and conviction in BTC’s long-term potential. Despite the current waning price action, the firm continues to accumulate the asset at a rapid rate. The founder recently hinted at another potential buy this week, as he highlighted that Bitcoin is still on sale while sharing a chart of Strategy’s BTC holdings.

Title: I was a VP at BlackRock before I started my own company. I saw 2 types of people in finance that helped me decide to pivot careers.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-blockrock-vp-pivoted-from-finance-healthcare-lifeforce-ceo-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-09-01T12:40:02Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 40-year-old Dugal Bain-Kim, a former BlackRock executive who founded a longevity startup in 2021. It has been edited for length and clarity. My first job in finance was the lowest rung on the European equities team at BlackRock. I was young, had a full tank of energy, and was just generally excited to have moved from my home in Australia to London. I was pumped to be living in what felt like the center of the world, working in finance. There was a lot of energy that came from the novelty of being able to earn my first real paychecks, having serious conversations, and just going out and making the best of London outside work. Around my fourth year at BlackRock, I became a VP at the firm, making low six-digit pounds. It felt great. Making decent money was something that was genuinely important to me for my career. It is for a lot of people. But I started to notice a shift in my energy at work. I'd been focused on getting the promotion for a while, and I got it. Then there was a bit of a come-down. There always is, but it sort of turned more into a bit of a funk. As I thought about it, I noticed that there were some people in the office who you could tell genuinely loved working in finance. On the weekend, they read The Financial Times cover to cover, and they chatted to each other about financial statements in the cafeteria. You could just tell that they were doing what they were meant to be doing, and they got a lot of energy from it. Then you could see that there were other people who, even if they were still pretty good at their jobs, were forcing it. They were doing it from extrinsic motivation, not intrinsic motivation — extrinsic motivation being money, status, promotions, perks, whatever it might be. As I started to notice that distinction, I definitely saw myself fitting into the second category. Finance wasn't what I would be thinking about in my own time. It's not what I wanted to talk about with people. I also felt that, at least on the investment-management side, a lot of the time, you were sort of this expert observation group that looked at people in the field, building and running companies, and then judged whether they were doing a good job. In those conversations, I noticed myself getting more and more curious-slash-envious abound the people who were actually in the field. I was in my late 20s when I left finance. It was kind of a sweet spot in my career, where I'd gotten paid decently along the way, but my lifestyle hadn't expanded so much that I was tied to the paycheck. I realized that I wanted to be in a sector that gave me multiple ways to win in my career. Meaning that if I worked on something, I would still be proud of the work I've done at the end of my career, regardless of success or earnings. I also wanted to work on something I felt was net beneficial for society and problems that I felt were important, which is a very personal decision. I have a history of people very close to me having very serious health issues. It's been a dominant theme for my family: How do you navigate the healthcare system, how do you advocate for yourself, how do you get access to the things that people can get access to if they have a lot of money and connections? When I started reading about the first generation of digital health companies using technology platforms to solve that problem, it hit very close to home. In 2021, I founded Lifeforce, a longevity medical program. There was a little bit of fear at first. It's a little bit like skiing — when you're standing on the top of the mountain about to tip your skis over. But honestly, by that point, the greater fear had become the regret of not having tried. I'm really pleased with the decision. It was definitely the right move and the ideal place for me to be. I don't regret my time in finance. It gave me a really good foundation for thinking about companies, how to think about markets, and even how to think about the workplace — what that's like and how to navigate different office dynamics. For example, how do you present yourself to more senior people? How do you work with other colleagues? It was a very professional, high-performance training ground that I think was generally very good for me. I would totally be open to my daughters working in consulting or finance for at least a few years to start their careers. I think it would give them a valuable set of fundamentals that will be useful in so many other ways. But I would also counsel them to be open-minded about whether it's a long-term or short-term thing. Those years in the professional world also helped me find out how I'm wired to think about work and what motivates me. Not everyone wants to work in a deeply mission-driven organization that happens to align with the cause that's most important to them. Frankly, it's not actually how a lot of people are wired. There are a lot of people who can actually do really well based on extrinsic motivations. They can feel happy about that, and that's awesome. Good luck to them as well. Once you understand that, it starts to inform what sort of "athlete" you are and, therefore, where you should take your career. Jump to

Title: Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Aoife Ryan\u002DChristensen Brainstorm Analysis: Property prices are still rising, not just because of supply but because of wages, demographics and population size Property prices in Ireland continue to be on the rise. The latest Property Price Index figures from the Central Statistics Office show that prices increased by 7.8% overall (8.0% on houses and 6.6% on apartments) in the 12 months to June 2025. The figures also show prices have been going up every month for two years now. The figures use the median price rather than the average: this gives a more accurate picture because the median isn't skewed by extreme outliers in the figures. While the median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June 2025 was €370,000, there are big differences across the country: The highest median price for a home (house or apartment) in the 12 months to June 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The region with the highest median price was Dublin, with a median price of €486,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the median price was €675,000. The least expensive area within Dublin was Fingal, which had a median price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €450,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, which had a median price of €425,000. The least expensive region over the last 12 months was Leitrim, where the median price paid for a dwelling was €190,000.

This data shows the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000.

"Because for the last three years 95% of all new housing in Dublin, for example, has been apartments, and 95% of those have been for rent, what you're going to see is house price inflation outside, in the greater Dublin area and going further out to your Westmeaths and your Longfords and places like that," says Dr Lorcan Sirr, Senior Lecturer in TU Dublin and housing policy analyst. "You're going to see more of that as people move further away from the urban core to buy homes, because there's nothing to buy in in the large urban areas. It's the same in Cork but to a lesser extent. You're going to see house price inflation continue, because the drivers of house price inflation aren't just the number of houses. It's also things like wages. Then there's demographics, the population is going up."

"So there's a whole load of other factors aside from the actual number of houses that we have, that influence house prices - and none of those are going in the right direction [for house prices to come down]." "There's nothing there that indicates to me that house prices are going to come down," he says. "The other factor is, people forget that of all the houses we build every year, in the last four or five years, less than 30% of them actually come to your estate agent for you to go and buy. The rest of them are snapped up by the State, or one-off homes and so on. There’s less and less actual supply on the market." "I suspect what you'll find is price inflation gathering pace further and further away from urban cores, as people move because nobody wants to rent. Yet government policies are directed towards incentives to rent. It’s bizarre."

Title: AI Agents Are Already Reshaping Business Leadership And Decision Making
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/09/01/ai-agents-are-already-reshaping-business-leadership-and-decision-making/
Time Published: 2025-09-01T05:28:46Z
Full Content:
ByBernard Marr, Contributor. When it comes to the work that can be carried out by AI agents, we often focus on repetitive and routine tasks. The types of tasks that machines can get really, really good at if they perform them again and again. Examples include writing and scheduling social media posts, solving routine customer service issues, or labelling and categorizing unstructured data. In case you’re not up to speed, agents can be thought of as generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT but with virtual arms, legs and the ability to take action on our behalf. A slightly more technical definition is that they are large language models (like ChatGPT’s GPT-5 engine) capable of connecting with other tools, including web browsers, to carry out more complex and sophisticated tasks, with minimal human intervention. But it would be wrong to think that agentic AI is only useful for low-level, tactical decision-making on the shop floor; What time should you send an email newsletter? Or which piece of machinery needs maintenance work? In fact, it’s increasingly being used by business leadership to make strategic or management decisions. One McKinsey study recently found that 53 percent of C-suite executives and 44 percent of middle managers use GenAI at work, putting them well ahead of the total overall figure. So here, I’ll take a look at some of the ways that agents are already making their way into business management functions. I’ll also provide some tips for anyone who wants to make sure they’re prepared for the convergence of agents and business leadership. No one will expect the average CEO to be ready to hand over control of their company to a machine any time soon. But there are many theoretical and a growing number of real-world use cases for agents in leadership and high-level decision-making. One of the most visible is through integration with the decision support systems often used to augment human decision-making by ensuring we have the information and guidance we need. For example, luxury goods manufacturer LVMH recently announced its decision to build a platform that will use agents to monitor and surface signals so decision-makers can react more quickly. Asset managers BlackRock have developed their own agentic platform, called Asimov. Asimov can work through the night, gathering research data in real time, monitoring market activity and scanning company filings, ready to present an actionable report to executives in the morning. And Citi Group has talked about its plans to divert some of its $12 billion tech budget into agentic AI, which could be used to connect different business AI initiatives, improving strategic oversight. Enterprise software vendors like Microsoft and Salesforce are increasingly building agentic functionality into their tools, to assist decision-makers with strategic advice, or deploying their own agents. This means we’re likely to see agents being used in exciting new ways as adoption grows among leadership in different industries. For example, in healthcare, agents could be used to monitor and oversee an increasingly sprawling connected health infrastructure. This helps leaders understand what's generating value, what's being underused, and what’s just a waste of resources. And in manufacturing, agents can track production operations, supply chain effectiveness and energy efficiency, creating opportunities to make strategic plays. While agents aren’t yet taking the wheel on business decision-making, they’re increasingly in the passenger seat, ready to help us navigate or warn about trouble ahead. So if you’re a leader or a decision-maker, what steps should you be taking to make sure you aren't left behind? Business decision-makers who’ve already had experience with deploying generative AI will be at an advantage here. But agentic AI requires a different approach, more suited to the long-term strategic planning tasks agents are built for. Agents are more big-picture and goal-oriented, and your thinking should be too. While ChatGPT can draft you an email, an agentic platform like Manus or Operator can create an email marketing strategy and build the infrastructure to deliver it. At least, in theory, it can, but it has to be noted that early adopters of those tools frequently report that they don’t always get it right just yet. From a general usage point of view, it's important to remember that AI agents are not simply evolved AI chatbots. They’re not really designed to chat or knock ideas back and forward about the best way to create something, which is something ChatGPT is good at. Agentic AI can be expensive because the "thinking" chews through a lot of tokens. So it’s best to go in with a clear idea of what you want and instruct the agent explicitly on how you would like it to achieve it. One of the great strengths of agents is that they can use digital tools just like we can, from using a web browser to shop online to controlling complex industrial machinery. Preparation for this might involve ensuring that proprietary and legacy systems can be persuaded to play nicely with agents. Or making a commitment towards open-source technology, where standardization is common and popular tools are likely to be quickly patched to work with an agentic ecosystem. Next tip: to fulfil their full potential, agents will need access to fast streams of high-value, timely data via well-documented APIs. Organizations that don’t have their house in order here are likely to miss opportunities as they attempt to catch up. And, absolutely critically, leaders must take steps to ensure they understand the principles of secure, responsible and ethical AI use. As we take steps to give AI the power to make more decisions on our behalf, the need for guardrails, oversight and accountability is more important than ever. Will we get to a point where machines are so good at predicting the right course of action that humans just aren’t needed? Could we even become a liability? Well, maybe one day. It’s pretty hard to know where this technology will be in two or three years, let alone ten years. But one thing we do know is that human brains are still immensely more complex than the best artificial brains. That additional complexity allows us to understand nuanced situations, navigate complex interpersonal relationships and make complex, long-term, strategic plans in ways that computers probably won’t be able to do for some time. This means that human leaders probably aren’t ready to delegate their powers entirely just yet. Instead, they will look to agents to help them become better leaders and more effective decision-makers.

Title: BlackRock has finally come for our utilities

BlackRock has finally come for our utilities. Here’s this, from a new article by Katya Schwenk at Jacobin: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has its tentacles in all facets of American life. The behemoth is buying up grocery brands, dental practices, apartment buildings, and nursing homes. But the opaque industry of private equity has mostly stayed away from electric utilities, the regulated companies that supply power to homes and businesses, because they often don’t yield quick returns. That’s changing. Last year, the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and a Canadian pension fund announced a $6.2 billion deal to buy Minnesota Power…. That deal faced tremendous pushback, and is not yet official, but here’s where things get really conspiratorial: after a judge issued a heavyhanded ruling against the acquisition, unions and “clean energy” advocacy organizations have come out of the woodwork to support the BlackRock takeover—Schwenk writes that when the proposed deal was announced, BlackRock executives “put the climate transition at the center of their pitch.” The “clean energy” groups with their “climate crisis” boogeyman strike again. Schwenk also uncovers some rather incestuous connections too: In at least one instance, union comments bear the fingerprints of an attorney working for BlackRock, document metadata shows. And: One of these [clean energy] groups is currently advertising a benefit event sponsored by Minnesota Power and the law firm representing BlackRock in the deal. And, it’s not just BlackRock. Another big player on Wall Street, Blackstone, is also in on the game, which recently announced its plans to acquire “a major electric utility in Texas and New Mexico” if permitted to do so. So why are these global investment firms turning their attention to our energy suppliers? Well, because the AI demand is set to drastically drive up energy consumption, and in a world of wind turbines and solar panels, that energy is going to be expensive. From Occupy Wall Street to “Don’t touch my globalist corporate overlord and his profits!”, leftists have a dizzying intellect (if it can even be called that). They really are the useful idiots we keep accusing them of being. Image from Grok. BlackRock has finally come for our utilities.

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Shares in Trip.com, the online travel site that has emerged as one of the China’s most successful private sector start-ups in the past quarter century, climbed to their highest Nasdaq close of 2025 on Thursday after the company said growth in bookings in the April-June quarter lifted revenue and profit. Trip.com closed at $75.03 at the Nasdaq on Thursday – its best since December, before falling back by 1.7% on Friday. Its U.S.-traded shares were still more than 13% higher than a week earlier, and have gained nearly 60% in the past year. In Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading, Trip.com closed up by 4.7% on Friday to HK$578, also its highest finish since December. Trip.com, then known as Ctrip, was founded in 1999 as a disruptor in China’s travel services industry, entering at a time when the field was dominated by offline state-owned companies. Beginning with hotel rooms, it began an Expedia-like online expansion into airline tickets, corporate travel services and even railway tickets. From its $250,000 in start-up capital, Trip.com’s market capitalization at the Nasdaq was $48 billion on Friday. That compares with $26 billion for Expedia. Trip.com said on Wednesday net revenue in the second quarter of 2025 rose by 16% year-on-year to $2.1 billion, helped by stronger travel demand, particularly during holidays. Accommodation reservation revenue for the second quarter rose by more than a fifth to $869 million, it said. Inbound travel bookings surged by more than 100% year-over-year, while outbound hotel and air ticket bookings topped 120% of the pre-COVID level for the same period in 2019. Those gains helped to lift net profit by more than a quarter to $676 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to company figures. "Our strategy focuses on capturing growing demand from every demographic, with special attention to inbound travel,” CEO Jane Sun said in a statement. Sun ranked No. 16 on a list of China’s top businesswomen published by Forbes China earlier this year. The company’s co-founders include billionaire venture capitalist Neil Shen, currently the founding and managing partner of HongShan (formerly known as Sequoia China), and Ji Qi, chairman of U.S. listed hotel company H World. Trip.com holds stakes in a number of hotels and resorts, including Atour, whose Nasdaq-traded shares have more then doubled in the past year. Shareholders include Chinese search engine Baidu, which owns about 7% of Trip.com and funds associated with BlackRock, 5.3%. Trip.com over the years has built up a network of more than 1.7 million hotels and flights from over 600 airlines, according to company figures. The site is available in 24 languages and offers 35 local currencies, Trip.com says. Trip.com shares trade at a forward price-earnings multiple of 20, compared with 15 for Expedia, according to media estimates. Expedia’s rises to 27 when you take out “extra items,” per Reuters.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat’s Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions. “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.” As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014. Responding to Tom Lee’s bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails. JPMorgan, for example, has used Ethereum-based technology for its permissioned blockchain projects for about a decade and is joined by Goldman Sachs, Onyx, and a growing roster of major banks launching stablecoin and DeFi initiatives on Ethereum. Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves. When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum’s supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption. And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via VanEck’s CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street’s token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs. As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative: “Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.” In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Ethereum’s surging momentum doesn’t come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum’s toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016. The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices. Still, bullish fundamentals remain. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states: “The one quibble that I have with what Tom has been saying, and I keep telling him this: he is not nearly bullish enough.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Could Ethereum be gearing up to outshine Bitcoin? Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs saw sharp outflows on the 29th of August, with ETH funds losing $164.6 million and BTC funds $126.6 million, amid renewed macroeconomic pressure. Ethereum’s [ETH] impressive streak of ETF inflows in August has come to a halt, closing the month on a note of heavy withdrawals. According to data from Farside Investors, ETH ETFs registered a sharp outflow of $164.6 million on the 29th of August. It effectively ended six consecutive days of strong inflows that had drawn nearly $1.9 billion into the market. Grayscale’s ETHE product led the retreat with $61.3 million in outflows, followed by $51 million from Fidelity’s ETH fund, $28.6 million from Grayscale’s other ETH offering, and $23.7 million from Bitwise. Other issuers, including BlackRock, saw no net flows on the day. The reversal coincided with Ethereum’s price action, trading at $4,442 after a 6.75% weekly decline, though it managed a slight 1% recovery in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. A similar trend played out on the Bitcoin [BTC] side, where ETFs recorded combined outflows of $126.6 million, the first day of losses since 22nd August. The largest outflow came from 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $72.1 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $66.2 million withdrawn, while Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $15.3 million in exits. However, the pain wasn’t universal, as BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $24.63 million and WisdomTree’s BTCW added $2.3 million, though most other issuers reported flat activity. This aligned with Bitcoin slipping 5.32% over the week but was changing hands at $108,783.89 with a modest 0.6% rebound in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The timing of these outflows further aligned with fresh macroeconomic data out of the U.S. In July, the Federal Reserve’s favored measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, increased by 2.9% compared to last year, marking its fastest rise since February. The hotter-than-expected print raised speculation about prolonged tight monetary policy, dampening appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, despite the near-term jitters, optimism around Ethereum’s long-term prospects remains intact. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin echoed the bullish thesis of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, both projecting that ETH’s valuation could climb by as much as 100 times over the coming years. Lubin noted, “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more. Yes, Ethereum/ETH will flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Lookonchain’s on-chain analytics highlighted that a long-term Bitcoin investor recently moved 2,000 BTC, valued at $217 million, into Hyperliquid to swap it for spot Ethereum. This shows a growing conviction among some seasoned players that Ethereum could outperform in the next cycle. In fact, as per AMBCrypto’s recent analysis, many market watchers believe that Q4 could ignite an Ethereum-led rally, with ambitious projections of a possible climb toward $10,000. If this becomes the case, then the recent outflows may be little more than a pause before Ethereum reclaims center stage in the crypto market.

Title: ETH And BTC ETFs Reverse Gains With $291M In Outflows Ahead Of New Week

US-based crypto ETFs have witnessed a change in dynamics in August, which has seen inflows tipping towards Ethereum ETFs. However, last week’s trend of strong inflows ended with substantial outflows on Friday, with Ethereum ETFs leading the retreat with $164.64 million and Bitcoin ETFs following with $126.64 million. This sudden reversal coincides with an interesting timing of stubborn inflation data that seems to have rattled institutional investors. According to data from Farside Investors, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs ended the week with $164.64 million in outflows. The outflows came from Fidelity’s FETH with $51 million, Bitwise’s ETHW with $23.7 million, Grayscale’s ETHE with $28.6 million, and Grayscale’s ETH with $61.3 million. BlackRock, on the other hand, witnessed neither inflows nor outflows into its Spot ETH ETFs, alongside 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton Ethereum ETFs. Friday’s outflows were a jarring departure from the steady gain that had defined Ethereum’s Spot ETFs since August 21. Ethereum’s six-day inflow streak, which had added about $1.876 billion, was brought to an abrupt end with the outflows on Friday. As a result, total assets under management for Spot Ethereum ETFs dipped to $28.58 billion. Ethereum ETF Flow: Farside Investors Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded their first daily decline since August 22 with $126.64 million in outflows on Friday. As a result, their total assets under management dropped to $139.95 billion. However, not every issuer felt the pressure with Bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $66.2 million, followed by ARKB’s $72.07 million and GBTC’s $15.3 million in outflows. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT still managed $24.63 million in inflows and WisdomTree’s BTCW drew in $2.3 million amid the wider outflows. Bitcoin ETF Flow: Farside Investors The underlying cause of the outflows can be attributed to investors digesting the latest data on inflation released on Friday. Notably, the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index climbed 2.9% year-over-year in July, the fastest pace since February, creating fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off on rate cuts. As a new trading week begins, Spot ETF flow in both Ethereum and Bitcoin is likely to depend on how investors continue to interpret the data. If inflation pressures persist, institutional investors may retreat further at the beginning of the week. However, any signs of cooling could see inflows resume mid-week, particularly into Ethereum, where fundamentals are currently favorable. On the price side of things, Bitcoin’s hold above the $108,000 price may offer some relief. However, it needs to stay above $110,000 in order for any upside move to gain momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,910. For Ethereum, a daily close above $4,500 could confirm the return of bullish confidence, whereas a slide below $4,400 might signal further weakness. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,470, up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: I missed out on my first choice in Trinity. Will CAO points drop in round two?

I missed out on my first-choice course – business, economics and social studies in Trinity – by 23 points in last Wednesday’s round of CAO offers. I have been offered another business degree programme in Dublin, but really want to study Bess in Trinity. What are the chances points will drop in later rounds? The chances of a high-demand course such as Bess at Trinity dropping in points by this margin is remote, based on trends over previous years. This means you have until 3pm on Tuesday, September 2nd, to accept the lower preference offer you received last Wednesday. After that, the offer lapses. If you are appealing grades in this year’s Leaving Cert, remember, there is usually a one-in-four or one-in-five chance of getting an upgrade, based on previous trends. If your mind is really set on securing a place in Bess at Trinity and you don’t accept your lower preference offer today, you have a number of options: 1. Repeat the Leaving Cert, hoping to secure higher scores next year. This route, once popular, has diminished in numbers in recent years. 2. Apply for a place in one of the business or law programmes offered by further education colleges in the next few days. You can access a list of all such level-five PLC (post-Leaving Cert) programmes online (Qualifax.ie). These programmes are usually assessed through a series of eight modules or assignments which students submit monthly from October-May. Further education (FE) or PLC courses as a route into university are probably one of the best-kept secrets of the education system. Many students – and parents – still don’t know enough about them, even though they offer an excellent route to third level, outside the pressure cooker CAO points system. In fact, there are more than 1,000 CAO courses across all areas which admit PLC students. In your case, I am aware of FE students who, having completed their level-five business or law programme, secured an offer of a place in Bess at Trinity. But in every case that I am aware of, the applicant secured distinctions across all eight modules in their course. This is a very useful pathway for students who need a year to prepare themselves for the challenges of university life. In PLC courses, students tend to have the time and space to develop more independent learning skills, learn to work in teams and deliver projects on time and to a high standard. So, if your heart really is set on Bess, why not seek a place on a locally based business PLC programme immediately. Blackrock Further Education College, for example, offers separate level-five programmes in both business and law. In the unlikely event you receive enough upgrades in the Leaving Cert, or the points requirements drop significantly in the coming weeks, you will receive a late offer from the CAO, which you could then accept.
