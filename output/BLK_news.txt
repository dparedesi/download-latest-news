Gould’s position would see him lead the regulator that monitors large national banks. The news was reported by Politico and Punchbowl News, citing a document sent to the Senate on Tuesday. Gould did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for him to confirm the reports. Gould is currently a partner at the Jones Day law firm, and apart from his previous role at Bitfury, he has also worked at BlackRock and as the senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel at the OCC, according to his LinkedIn page. Tech firm Bitfury produces Bitcoin mining equipment and describes itself as the world’s “full-service blockchain technology company.” The Trump Administration has selected a large number of tech and crypto-friendly individuals to regulate the financial space. On Tuesday, news dropped that former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz was nominated to rejoin the agency as its chief. Quintenz currently heads crypto policy at the crypto arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z. President Donald Trump campaigned to help the digital asset and AI sector and received financial backing from bigwigs in both industries. Now, top regulators are expected to take a more friendly approach to both burgeoning industries. The Securities and Exchange Commission has even launched a crypto task force aimed at developing new regulation for the industry—and cleaning up the “mess” that the SEC created under President Joe Biden, as Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote last week.

Title: The New York Stock Exchange is coming to Texas

The Lone Star State is on track to become a business hub, rivaling the likes of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange announced Wednesday that it would be relocating its Chicago headquarters to Dallas. The fully electronic exchange will serve as a platform for companies to list and trade securities. "As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere," NYSE Group president Lynn Martin said in a statement. The NYSE did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Over the past decade, hundreds of businesses, including Charles Schwab, Oracle, and HPE, have established a base in Texas, their leaders citing business-friendly taxes and regulations. Billionaire Elon Musk has added momentum to the migration. He moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021. In July, he announced that he would also move X and SpaceX to Texas, and said that other companies would follow suit. Texas is now home to more than 3.3 million startups and small businesses and 1 in 10 publicly traded companies in the US, according to a fact sheet from Texas governor Greg Abbott. At $2.6 trillion, it's the eighth largest economy in the world, surpassing countries like Russia, Canada and Italy. "Texas is the most powerful economy in the nation, and now we will become the financial capital of America," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement on Wednesday. "With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage." The arrival of the centuries-old NYSE signals that Dallas may be emerging as the state's financial capital. In January, the Texas Stock Exchange — a smaller competitor backed by major financial institutions like BlackRock, Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab — announced that it had filed its Form 1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and was targeting a 2026 launch.

Title: Ethereum: 4 reasons why ETH has room for more growth
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-4-reasons-why-eth-has-room-for-more-growth/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T23:30:28Z

Despite increased negative side factors, demand for Ethereum remains high and positions ETH for recovery. Since reaching $4.1k two months ago, Ethereum [ETH] has failed to maintain an upward momentum. Over this period, it has experienced extreme volatility, even dropping as low as $2.1k. These market conditions have awakened strong sentiments among crypto analysts, with some being optimistic while others are highly pessimistic. One of those who have shown high optimism despite the price struggle is CryptoQuant’s analyst Mac, who has pointed out that Ethereum still has room for growth. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, despite the prevailing negative supply side factors, Ethereum’s potential for upward growth remains significantly high. Source: CryptoQuant This upward potential can be seen through four major factors. First, Ethereum’s current realized price was around $2.2k at press time, which was considerably undervalued, compared to its price of $2.6k. 2.2k serves as a strong support level, as such, the circulating MVRV based on the realized price yields a value above 1. At this level, it indicates that ETH is highly undervalued. Second, Ethereum’s number of permanent holders who have accumulated Ethereum and never sold has experienced a sustained rise. While some whales may have closed their positions, permanent holders have absorbed this selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant Third, Ethereum has seen the selling pressure in the futures market reduce. This indicates that although prices have declined, the selling pressure has also decreased, suggesting a relative inflow of buying power. Source: CryptoQuant Finally, institutional investors are aggressively accumulating Ethereum. When ETH’s price plunged, institutions turned to buy the dip. Thus, BlackRock bought 100.5k ETH worth $276 million, Cumberland ETH worth $174 million, and other institutions such as WLFI are actively buying. This buying pressure is key as it’s acting as a factor offsetting downward pressure. Therefore, although Ethereum is struggling to sustain gains, there are positive factors from the demand side. Notably, ETH was experiencing positive sentiment from the demand side. At press time, Ethereum’s Taker buy-sell ratio flipped positive to reach 1.05 after being negative for the past five days. This implies that buyers have reentered the market and are outweighing sellers. Source: CryptoQuant Additionally, Ethereum’s Fund market premium has flipped positive for the first time this week. When FMP turns positive, it suggests that investors are bullish and longs are paying shorts to hold their trade as they anticipate the market to rebound. Source: CryptoQuant Finally, Ethereum’s exchange reserve is at a yearly low, suggesting that investors are actively accumulating ETH. As such, more ETH is moving off exchanges, suggesting that investors are keeping their assets in cold storage. Source: CryptoQuant In conclusion, although Ethereum is struggling on the supply side, the demand is high. With a high demand, ETH could see the market strengthen to reclaim a higher resistance. Therefore, with the supply and demand sides still fighting for control, ETH will continue to trade sideways until the markets and macroeconomic conditions are strong enough for an uptrend.

Title: Trump nominates Jonathan McKernan as director of CFPB

Jonathan McKernan / Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Wikimedia Commons President Donald Trump has nominated Jonathan McKernan as the new director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a major move in the administration’s broader government restructuring.

President Donald Trump has nominated Jonathan McKernan as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a major move in the administration’s broader government restructuring. The nomination has been sent to the Senate and is expected to be approved. McKernan, who previously served as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and senior counsel of policy at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), announced his departure from the FDIC just a day before his nomination. If confirmed, he will rejoin the FDIC board in a secondary role. McKernan takes over the CFPB after a series of acting directors, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. On Feb. 6, Vought was confirmed by the Senate to lead the Office of Management and Budget just three days after firing Biden-era CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As acting director, Vought quickly moved to scale back CFPB operations, following Trump’s executive orders aimed at shrinking the federal government by: The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CFPB employees, responded by filing two lawsuits against Vought on Feb. 9. One suit challenges Vought’s order to stop work, calling it “unlawful,” while the other argues that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) should not have access to CFPB employee data, citing potential risks of misuse. Before McKernan’s nomination, he pushed for stronger oversight of large asset managers at the FDIC, arguing that their influence could distort bank management, according to Banking Dive. Though generally aligned with Republican priorities, he has backed bipartisan efforts to tighten regulations on firms such as Vanguard and BlackRock. His prior experience includes serving as a senior financial policy advisor for Sen. Bob Corker, former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and holding counsel roles with the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the U.S. Treasury. According to the FDIC, McKernan also co-chaired a special committee that oversaw an independent review of workplace misconduct and issues with workplace culture from November 2023 to May 2024. Peter Idziak, a senior associate at mortgage law firm Polunsky Beitel Green, said many in the lending industry are hopeful that McKernan’s nomination signals that rather than shutting the CFPB down, the Trump administration intends to revisit policies and practices that have allegedly increased costs for consumers and stifled innovation. “Given McKernan’s policy expertise and significant tenure within government, his nomination may signal that the Trump Administration ultimately intends to reform the CFPB rather than ‘deleting’ it,” Idziak said, in a statement. The Trump administration “may have realized that simply hollowing out the Bureau would leave regulations crafted by the Biden administration in place to be enforced by states and the courts.” The CFPB polices illegal kickbacks in the real estate industry, in addition to protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive lending practices. The legislation that created the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, transferred regulatory oversight of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the CFPB. RESPA includes restrictions and prohibitions aimed at preventing mortgage lenders and settlement services providers from paying real estate agents and brokers for sending their business their way without providing proper disclosures to consumers.

Listed on the Nasdaq, the $594 million money market fund is tokenized, meaning its shares are issued as digital assets across various networks. Investors are able to access FOBXX using Franklin Templeton’s Benji Investments mobile app, which serves as a digital wallet. First launched in 2021, FOBXX enables investors to gain exposure to U.S. government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. Maintaining a share price of $1, the fund’s BENJI token closely resembles a yield-bearing stablecoin. New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on @solana! Solana is a fast, secure and censorship resistant Layer 1 blockchain encouraging global adoption via its open infrastructure.

It faces stiff competition from BlackRock and its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, aka BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last spring. Among $3.6 billion in tokenized treasury products, BUIDL’s market cap has swelled to $637 million, muscling past BENJI’s total value last April, according to rwa.xyz data. Franklin Templeton’s decision to issue BENJI on Solana, however, places the product within one of crypto’s buzziest ecosystems for decentralized finance, or DeFi applications. BlackRock’s BUIDL has, so far, not been issued on the speedy layer-1 network. Though the metric is considered somewhat crude, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has grown to $9 billion, making it the second most valuable DeFi ecosystem behind Ethereum’s $56 billion landscape (not including Ethereum scaling networks), according to DefiLlama data. Encompassing real-world assets like bonds, real estate, and gold, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once dubbed tokenization the “next evolution of markets,” enabling near-instantaneous settlement and reduced fees. While tokenized markets are still in their infancy, British bank Standard Chartered projected last month the tokenization sector could grow to as much as $30 trillion by 2034. In November, BlackRock expanded BUIDL’s footprint to five new blockchains, issuing shares on Aptos, Avalanche, and the Ethereum scaling networks Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. First available on Ethereum sidechain network Polygon and the layer-1 network Stellar, BENJI expanded to Ethereum last year, as well as Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and the Coinbase-launched Ethereum scaling network Base.

Title: Acting SEC Chair Says Climate-Related Disclosure Rule Is Illegal

FILE - The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters, June 19, 2015, ... [+] in Washington.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. The final rule required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, greenhouse gas emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The rule was immediately met with legal challenges and was delayed while the court heard the cases. On February 11, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda began the process to permanently end the rule, leaving climate advocates and businesses that heavily invested in reporting reeling. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions. On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. Now it appears the delay will become permanent. Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. It was clear that his exit, effective the day President Trump took office, would significantly alter the SEC’s approach to those topics. On February 11, acting SEC Chair Uyeda, a Biden appointee, effectively ended the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. In the statement, Uyeda said, “The Rule is deeply flawed and could inflict significant harm on the capital markets and our economy.” “Both Commissioner Peirce and I voted against the Rule’s adoption. Commissioner Peirce said that then-existing disclosure rules were sufficient and that the ‘[R]ule’s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs.’ She argued that ‘only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.’ I stated that the Commission was ‘without statutory authority or expertise’ to address climate change issues and that ’this [R]ule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission’s seal.’” “The Commission’s briefs previously submitted in the cases consolidated in the Eighth Circuit do not reflect my views… I also question whether the agency followed the proper procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt the Rule.” As a result, Acting Chair Uyeda has asked the court for a delay in the proceedings while the SEC takes action to rollback the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. As a result, climate reporting at the national level is effectively dead. The focus now turns to the states and international actions.

Title: NYSE Plans Texas Exchange as Financial Firms Flock to State

The New York Stock Exchange plans to start an equities exchange in Texas, the latest firm seeking a slice of the financial services industry in a state where the taxes are lower and regulation looser. NYSE said it will reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas and will launch the fully electronic exchange in Dallas, pending regulatory filings. The exchange will serve companies from Texas and around the world, it said. NYSE’s move underscores the heightened allure of Texas for corporations and financial firms seeking to benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment than blue states like New York and California. Dallas is host to the Texas Stock Exchange, which counts BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities among its backers and plans to begin trading in early 2026. Nasdaq last year reorganized its listings business into three regional divisions including Texas. “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” NYSE President Lynn Martin said in a statement. The NYSE’s plans give another boost to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which already has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is building a new campus in Dallas that will house about 5,000 employees. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Although the state is known for its business-friendly approach, the Texas Stock Exchange has faced some other challenges. It was already contending with an uphill climb to secure listings. Its promises to avoid what could be seen as political requirements, like board composition requirements, have lost punch as companies have begun rolling back diversity and environmental pledges. It would also need to bite off business from private equity. “They’re not only competing against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,” said Andrew Silverman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re also competing against Blackstone. They’re also competing against Apollo. They’re also competing against Berkshire Hathaway.” TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, recently closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement. “We have known all along that Texas is the best place to do business.” NYSE and its biggest rival Nasdaq dominate the IPO market, which is rebounding after a lengthy slump on geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and higher interest rates. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said last month she expects a strong environment for IPOs in the second quarter and rest of the year. NYSE’s move to Dallas is “going to bring more financial firms with it, and force Texas to reinforce its infrastructure,” said David Choate, chief operating officer of Dallas-based brokerage firm CAPIS. “You’re always wanting to be on the cutting edge of technology if you’re hosting financial firms like exchanges,” he said.

Title: NYSE comes to Dallas with rebranded branch as Texas Stock Exchange eyes launch

Business By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter The New York Stock Exchange will reincorporate its Chicago branch in Texas, it announced on Wednesday, rebranding it as NYSE Texas and moving to Dallas. With the upstart Texas Stock Exchange taking shape and the Nasdaq expanding its reach in the Lone Star State, the Dallas region is about to find out if “Y’all Street” is big enough for three players. Timing of the Big Board’s “fully electronic” Texas equity market will depend on regulatory filings, the NYSE said. The announcement comes as a number of big companies flock to Texas as a whole, drawn in by its low taxes and business-friendly regulation. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” Lynn Martin, president of NYSE Group, said in a statement. “We are delighted to expand our presence in the Lone Star State, which plays a key role in driving our U.S. economy forward.” New York’s NYSE and Nasdaq have had a near duopoly on the U.S. securities market for decades, but both apparently see a formidable challenger in the Dallas-based upstart TXSE. The startup has gotten $161 million in initial backing from financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, and is on track for an early 2026 launch. Late last month, it filed for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The TXSE’s goal is to lower the costs of getting listed while also raising standards for who gets to be listed, in order to reincentivize companies to go public while taking advantage of Texas’ robust business community. “The Texas Stock Exchange is harnessing this momentum to build a national securities exchange in our home state. We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement responding to NYSE’s announcement. “The mission of the Texas Stock Exchange is to bring competition back to the markets, and we look forward to cementing Dallas as one of the financial capitals of the world.” Recently, the Nasdaq announced a new regional management division based in nearby Irving, just months after TXSE founder and CEO James Lee announced he’d raised over $100 million in capital. “Texas is the most powerful economy in the nation, and now we will become the financial capital of America,” said Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage.” Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News.

Title: Ukraine regaining pre-2014 borders is 'unrealistic objective,' Hegseth says in first NATO visit

But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering." -snip- "A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again," Hegseth said Wednesday. "The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops." "If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact," he continued. "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine." -snip- Hegseth also said he is in Brussels today to "directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being primarily focused on the security of Europe." "The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must -- and we are -- focusing on securing our own borders," he said. "We also face a peer competitor in China with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific." (Excerpt) Read more at foxnews.com ...

The results are in: The Democratic Party’s Bidenomics strategy produced a disastrous score of just 160,000 extra jobs for Americans during each year of President Joe Biden’s presidency. President Joe Biden’s dismal Bidenomics also created jobs for 4.7 million migrants — including almost three million illegals, according to federal data collected by the Center for Immigration Studies and reported on February 7. So Bidenomics created 7.3 migrant jobs for every job gained by an American, even as it also exploded the national debt by $8 trillion. Bidenomics also flatlined wages, spiked housing costs, and slowed workplace investment. The Bidenomics 7:1 policy — 4.7 million jobs for migrants, 645,000 for Americans — was deliberate. Bidenomics deliberately stranded millions of working-age Americans outside the workforce, without jobs or prospects, often homeless and on drugs, and usually dependent on expensive government aid. “The share of working-age (16 to 64) U.S.-born men not in the labor force — neither working nor looking for work — is likely 22.1 percent in January 2025 and remains near a historic high for an economic expansion,” the Center for Immigration Studies reported February 7. The 22 percent — one in five! — is far above the 16.6 percent seen in January 2000. If Biden and Congress had cared, roughly 5 million working-age American men could have been found, trained to use work-multiplying machinery, de-toxified, put back on their feet, and hired into starter jobs. But Biden’s deputies repeatedly showed that they favored importing more migrants than the once-normal option of helping millions of ordinary Americans get ready for high-productivity jobs. “As our economy grows, we need workers that we just don’t have enough of,” Katie Tobin, the senior director for transborder security on the National Security Council, told a D.C. audience in May 2023. “So it is in our interest to bring people in and to stay competitive globally.” “We look to the north, with Canada,” migration czar Alejandro Mayorkas told a Texas audience in September: Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. During their four years, Buden’s deputies replaced those Americans with a flood of roughly 9 million southern migrants, roughly three million legal airport migrants, and roughly 4 million temporary migrants. Those airport arrivals included roughly 1.5 million white-collar workers carrying H-1B, J-1, L-1, and OPT/EAD visa documents that allow them to take jobs from American college graduates. That huge inflow displaced many Americans from jobs, cities, and the workforce. The displacement was so massive that the share of Americans who held jobs arguably declined during Biden’s years. In a chart posted by Harvard economist Jason Furman, the other countries that did badly on that measure were the migration-flooded United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Mayorkas, Tobin, and Biden’s other deputies had several reasons to prefer inviting migrants over helping their fellow Americans. First, migration is a rapid way to expand the national pool of consumers, workers, and renters before the next election. Migration means there is no need to wait 25 years for Americans to marry, raise their kids, and get them into jobs. Their get-rich-quick policy worked; The inflow of migrants quickly expanded the economy, creating a rush of extra profits and new stock values for investors — even as the rush of migrants pushed down wages and pushed up housing costs for ordinary Americans. RELATED — White House Despairs: ‘Pollsters Are Not Asking the Right Questions’ About Biden’s Economic Policies Second, the rush of migrants held down the wage-driven inflation once the gusher of Biden spending spilled into pay packets and weekly wages. That was good for the White House’s friends on Wall Street. For example, Goldman Sachs celebrated the inflow of wage-cutting migrants because it would reduce inflation. Third, Biden’s deputies favored more migration because it reduced the pressure on employers to divert their profits and stock values toward greater workplace productivity. Normally, productivity improvements — such as better-skilled workers, swifter robots, and subtle software — are very desirable because they generate both extra profits for CEOs and higher wages for workers. However, productivity improvements are expensive, so they reduce near-term quarterly profits, stock values, and executive bonuses. This means that most investors are loath to invest in productivity — especially because the government has deliberately helped them by extracting millions of workers and consumers from poor countries since 1990. The results of this cheap labor vs productivity trade-off can be tracked over a few years. For example, the loss of migrant labor during Trump’s first-term crackdown and the coronavirus disease “spurred approximately an additional $55 billion in investment in the U.S. economy,” the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Loius reported in June 2024. But the investment fell — and so did productivity gains — once Biden’s deputies flooded the labor market with cheap migrant workers. Basically, Biden’s team stuffed the economy with more federal dollars, unproductive workers, consumers, and renters — and the stock market zoomed to record levels. MorningStar.com reported: The 46th president of the United States is bringing his time at the White House to a close with the S&P 500 SPX up over 55% since he took office on Jan. 20, 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA advanced more than 39% over the same period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped nearly 46%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. But there was a flaw. The migrant workers also need to sleep and eat, and so they fuelled rent, housing, and food inflation far more than Biden’s deputies expected. “On net [after inflation], real wages have fallen since January 2021.” former White House economist Furman wrote in a February 10 article for Foreign Affairs. Once inflation ate into wages, ordinary Americans averaged a wage gain of less than half a percent during Biden’s four years. Furman’s economic analysis is titled “The Post-Neoliberal Delusion And the Tragedy of Bidenomics.” The analysis is echoed by one of Elon Musk’s investor friends, Chamath Palihapitiya. He is an immigrant from Sri Lanka who founded Social Capital, which seeks to make money from the health, financial services, and education sectors. Ironically, Trump and his GOP deputies gained many new jobs in January 2025 when the understandably angry voters defenestrated Biden and his deputies in November. Despite the obvious damage and chaos, the establishment’s media is still hiding the Biden/Mayorkas economic disaster from citizens, mostly by posting sympathetic stories urging Americans to empathize with unlucky but hard-working migrants. On February 4, the Washington Post reported on two imported workers who Mayorkas “paroled” into U.S. jobs to reduce the pressure on U.S. employers to raise wages: Among them were a 25-year-old man from the Boston area who asked that his name not be used, because he, his wife and their 3-year-old daughter fear losing their temporary protection and being deported to Venezuela. He said they fled extreme poverty and fear under the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro in 2023, and trekked for three months through a hazardous jungle and north into Mexico in order to reach the U.S. border. In Venezuela, he worked as a construction worker for $30 a week, unable to pay for basics such as milk. In Massachusetts, he earns $180 a day working on a demolition crew and moonlights cleaning at a hotel. His wife also has a job cleaning at a hotel. He said Trump is wrongly portraying Venezuelans as criminals. “We came to this country to work,” he said. For the moment, President Donald Trump is helping to fix the mess by blocking the arrival of Mayorkas’ illegal and quasi-legal migrants. He is also helping by deporting perhaps 1,000 migrants a day, starting with criminals and migrants who have lost their legal appeals to stay. Predictably, establishment media outlets worry that Trump’s shutdown of the Mayorkas migration might raise wages for ordinary Americans. For example, Politico.com reported on February 7 that “a broad-based crackdown on immigrants could slow the economy’s expansion and choke off a supply of workers that Kansas City Fed researchers and others say have alleviated staffing shortages and eased wage pressures [emphasis added].” Rationally, business lobbyists are now working to ensure Mayorkas’ roughly 9 million illegals can stay — and to ensure the continued inflow of more migrants and visa workers. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com reported that a “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign seeks to persuade Trump to keep most migrants: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” … In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. Trump’s voters backed him because he seemed to promise he would Make Americans Great Again — not just America. If he resists pro-migration pressure from businesses, he may show Americans how a low-migration policy of “tight labor” can create greater productivity, higher wages, more trade, more innovation, and a stronger economy, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week at his White House meeting with India’s Prime Minister. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Everyone else agrees they’re struggling. But how do men themselves feel about it? We sat down with twelve everyday guys from across America to get their candid opinions—on money, masculinity, Donald Trump—and find out what’s really on their minds. What exactly is going on in the minds of young men? It’s a question that society keeps coming back to these days because, truth is, we’re worried. Everything we’re told about the rising generation of men in America—everything they’re told about themselves, in the media, the academic research, the employment data, the mental-health studies—is about how royally screwed they are. And that has consequences for all of us. You’ve read the headlines. Young men today are angry. They’re lonely and friendless. The data shows that they are falling behind young women in school and at the workplace, living with their parents longer, playing too many video games, watching too much porn, getting married much later in life (or not at all), having fewer kids (or none at all), and facing a lifetime of student-loan debt, credit-card debt, and medical debt. As a result, many of them are adopting increasingly extreme beliefs, getting hooked on opioids, and killing themselves at alarming rates. They feel ignored by politicians, blamed for society’s ills, and forced to keep their toxic, privileged, microaggressive mouths shut about it. But what no one can seem to agree on is why. Is social media to blame? There’s no doubt that growing up in the age of the smartphone has profoundly shaped the lives (and brains) of anyone under twenty-five, and most of the rest of us, too. But that applies to young women as well, and they don’t seem to be drifting as badly as men are. Rather than add our voice to the chorus of speculation about what guys are thinking and feeling about the world, we had a radical idea: Let’s just ask them. Not all of them, of course. There are nearly 16 million men in the U. S. between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four. We weren’t looking to conduct yet another survey. Instead, we wanted to have long conversations with a relatively small group about what it’s like to be a young man in America right now. Our first step was to seek out regular, everyday guys. No influencers or celebrities or lunatics. Just guys like the ones we all know. Guys with so many of their big life decisions still ahead of them. In the end, we settled on twelve men from different parts of the country representing a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. We asked them to submit portrait photos of themselves, and most of them did. As you’ll see, they reflect much of the frustration and alienation we expected—but not always in the ways we anticipated. They were thoughtful and candid. They surprised us. If there was one subject that came up again and again, it was Donald Trump. Timing had a lot to do with it. Our conversations followed Trump’s reelection in November, a victory powered in part by young male voters. Men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a margin of 56–42, a dramatic reversal of 2020, when they voted for Biden over Trump by a 56–41 margin. For the young men we spoke with—guys who’ve come of age in the MAGA era—talking about Trump was often shorthand for discussing class, race, masculinity, and the big subjects that were really on their minds. Here’s what they had to say, in their own words. I noticed the shift in people of color moving conservative a year, maybe a year and a half in advance. I remember a conversation with my mom about seven months before the election—we were in the swimming pool, and she was like, “Oh, this election, I’m not sure what’s going to happen.” And I told her, “Trump has already won the election. I know for a fact.” Because he’d stolen the support of people of color from the Democrats, especially men. You could just see it. The first thing I noticed was how conservative so many young Hispanic men were—it is mind-­boggling to me how conservative. My girlfriend is half Latino, and she kept telling me, “Aidan, Latino men are more conservative than people think.” This notion that Latinos always support Democrats—it’s very false. I was also noticing in my community, a bunch of Asian American men, they were thinking the same way. They were starting to talk out loud about supporting Trump. The first thing was the LGBTQ community normalizing the idea that you can have a bunch of genders, you can have whatever pronouns you want, and that you can introduce that to very young children. And then with Asian men, the Harvard case that overturned affirmative action a few years ago—remember, the people who filed the lawsuit were not white. They were Chinese. They were like, Wait, affirmative action discriminates against us. That’s when the Chinese vote started to go. And then I did not realize this, but my girlfriend’s also Vietnamese, and she was telling me that most Vietnamese people are conservative. So guess what? Now Trump’s got the Vietnamese support. And obviously his white male support is only growing. So in my head I’m like, How is Biden going to win this election? He’s lost half the people of color to Trump. To me, it’s not necessarily that men were drawn to Trump—it’s men pulling away from Democrats. That’s one key thing I really want to say. I think this shift happened not necessarily because of anything Trump was doing. It’s because of what the Democrats did. They decided to let in all this pronoun stuff and this whole idea of censoring young men and emasculating them. And then with people of color, like me, they seem to assume, like, Of course you’re going to vote for us. We’re your allies. We’re going to help you. The Republicans aren’t going to do anything for you. But then the Democrats get in power in 2020, and people of color are kind of waiting, like, Okay, so . . . what are you going to do for us? And then you look at the end and the Black community is still in the same position. Asian Americans are now getting discriminated against in educational systems, and you’re losing Latinos because of this LGBTQ stuff that’s relevant to literally 1 percent of the population and you’re trying to kind of force it on everyone else. I dropped out of community college because I got a job as a butler at the Venetian casino and I was making good money, so I put everything else on the back burner. What a butler does is, from the moment the whales and high-end guests arrive, we greet them, we grab their things, we bring them their food, we do everything they need—personalized and intimate service. The tips can get pretty big. I got $750 once. I know a guy who once got $5,000. But that job didn’t work out. There was an issue where I accepted a tip—for one dollar—and I forgot to write it down on my log at the end of the day. The next day I had to go out of town, and by the time I came back, HR was already involved. Every square inch of that building is monitored. When they saw on my log that I didn’t have anything tipped in, one of the other coworkers was like, “No, no—I was right there when he accepted his tip.” He ratted me out. They went back into the footage and I got fired. I was very, very upset. I was ready to settle down and get really good at that job. I like learning new things, and it was this world of whiskeys and wine and fine dining—all this luxurious stuff that I’d never been exposed to. I grew up lower middle class, so it was an entirely new world. That was the best part about coming into work every day—something new to learn, a new problem to solve. And then all of a sudden I was back at my job at Domino’s. Being a butler definitely jaded me. Look, I feel like successful people should be able to appreciate the fruits of their labor. That doesn’t bother me. And a lot of rich people aren’t insanely rich—they’re millionaires, not billionaires. They’re normal people when it comes down to it. But when you start dealing with old-money people—how they treat the people around them and the people under them—it opens your eyes. I would overhear conversations around a poker table where executives are talking like, “Well, if we get rid of this department here and we lay off six hundred people here, we can put that money here.” Meanwhile they’re playing poker with $100,000 a hand. The most insane thing I can remember was buying suitcases for a guest because they bought all these bottles of liquor from us and they needed something to take them home in. Two suitcases full of approximately $300,000 worth of wine and liquor. It’s the frivolousness that’s the breaking point for me—the way they can spend all that money and have no repercussions, but those repercussions spread to us, lower down. It’s fucking bullshit. I have friends going hungry, not because they don’t want to work but because they’re not given enough hours to be full-time and get health insurance. Five years ago, if you had a job that paid fifteen to twenty dollars an hour, you were set. And now it doesn’t feel like that anymore. Your dollar just doesn’t go as far. Real estate has doubled here in Vegas. The eleven-hundred-square-foot apartment that I rented with my girlfriend in 2018 for $1,100—I looked a few weeks ago, and now it’s going for $1,950. It’s so hard to build savings right now. I spent years building up enough for a down payment on a house, and I’d just gotten to the point where I could feasibly do it, and then I needed to pay for a car repair earlier this year and a lot of that money went away. You learn to live with this fear and paranoia, like, What if I shatter my leg and I can’t work? What would I do? I am not a fan of Donald Trump—I’d say I lean very left—but at the end of the day, he understands that Americans are angry and upset, and he’s really good at channeling that. As Americans, we’re all feeling the same pressures, we all see prices are rising, we’re all making less money. We all notice it. But the Republicans are a lot more ready to say, “This is the reason. It’s that guy. This is who you should be mad at.” The bigger split in America for me is not left or right. It’s class—it’s whether you’re bourgeois or you’re proletariat. It comes down to whether you make enough money to be in their special club. There’s this pastor I like to listen to named Voddie Baucham, and he talks about how men think the definition of manhood is the Three B’s: the billfold, the ball field, and the bedroom. Like, it’s all about how much money you make, how well you perform at sports, and how many girls you can get with in the bedroom. And I think that’s . . . not totally wrong? I mean they are signs. If you can perform on the ball field, that shows power and strength and your ability to protect yourself, which is important. If you’re making money, that doesn’t automatically mean you’re competent, but it shows signs of competency. And then bedroom—I don’t know, that one doesn’t make as much sense. But his point was that the Three B’s are how the culture is defining manhood today, and the correct way is how the Bible defines it, which is all about love and family and sacrifice. My friends say I’m a based Christian guy—“based” like based in truth, someone who’s more realistic and objective. I appreciate the objective truth of conservatism, but I also understand the compassion of liberals. Overall, I’d say I’m like 60 percent conservative, 40 percent liberal. Maybe 70–30. And Christianity is a really good guide for being conservative, because there’s this objective eternal being at the center of it who’s been unchanged the whole time. And I do believe some things are just objectively true, like: I am a man. It doesn’t really matter if someone wants to be called a man—that doesn’t change what you are. Sorry, that’s it. You weren’t assigned it by a doctor. You were assigned it by God. And going against that is rebellion. If God’s making these rules, it’s not because He wants to be a cosmic killjoy. If I’m going to trust anyone about the world, I would trust the person who made it. It’s like going against the video game developer’s ideas for how to play the video game. You’re just going to lose. For thousands of years, men have been the rock of society. And now because there have been so many tyrannical leaders, people want to take that power away from men and say it’s for everybody. Just because some men did it the wrong way. Like, it’s kind of unfair to men to say, “We don’t need you anymore because of how well you did at building a society.” And I’m like, “Well, we kind of built this country and fought and died for it . . .” I didn’t vote, because I didn’t feel like going through the process, and I didn’t see the point, because Biden was going to win California, even though it was way closer than I thought. But if someone had put a gun in my head and told me to vote, I would’ve voted for Trump. I think minority guys are tired of feeling like they are expected to vote a certain way just because of their color. Even Obama, who basically shamed Black guys for not voting for Kamala—I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe this party nothing. I’m not going to get reprimanded by you when I’m an autonomous man who can make decisions for myself. I don’t need you to browbeat me like I’m your son. Sometimes I think we’re like an anti-welfare state. We’re not really into helping people in this country. I just feel like we live in a very individualistic society, and so it’s all about “How do you stand out as an individual? How do you make yourself stand out from the pack?” You can even see this with car culture in our country—young men always want to buy the most massive truck and drive around in it. I live outside Denver in a town called Golden, and the Colorado School of Mines, which is a big petroleum and gas college, is here in Golden. So a lot of guys come out here from Texas and they drive these giant lifted pickup trucks—these massive old F-150’s that’ve been jacked up so there’s like three feet of separation between the wheels and the body. I grew up with a lot of these guys in Bozeman, Montana—cowboy-type dudes. That’s manhood out here in the western states: Every man wants to be a cowboy. They want to buy cowboy boots and the cowboy hat and drive an old pickup truck, or the new pickup truck if they’re wealthy. And they vote for Republicans. I didn’t really like those guys. I grew up with two sisters, so I guess I’ve always been more comfortable around women. If you’re not overconfident, it’s really hard to get ahead in this country. You really have to act like you know what you’re talking about all the time. And that’s definitely not something that I was doing in the past. I hate talking about myself, promoting myself. But when I decided to go to grad school, I just kind of made up my mind that I was going to start. I made this separation in my brain between my home life and my work life—at work, I was going to be this alternative person who was really competitive and confident all the time and could talk about himself very easily. And as soon as I made that switch, people were a lot more attracted to me. I’m getting treated better by this country, by our systems, our culture. That’s how America works. People in this country love confident people who seem like they’re smart, who seem to know what they’re talking about, even if they don’t. And Donald Trump is the embodiment of the confident man who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s like: Take what you want, grab it, it’s yours—everyone else is telling you you’re not supposed to be this way, but you’re allowed to be this way because I’m this way. He’s kind of a reaction to all the beta cucks out there—men like me, I guess. But I don’t think that it’s just my generation of men that’s angry. I think it’s all of them. It’s the emotion that men are taught. It’s the one that we get. It’s not manly to feel all the other ones. But anger is for sure. My generation—I don’t think we have very much power, so maybe that’s part of our anger. Our lives are being dictated by people who are decades and decades older than us, and they just don’t get it. They just don’t understand that the world has changed, that you can’t buy a house for three lucky magic beans anymore. I feel like our generation is just waiting for our moment to take up our power, but I don’t know if we’re ever going to get there, because it seems like these boomers are trying to hang on forever. I see it in my work, too—anytime you go to a public hearing or a city-­council meeting, they dominate those meetings, because they have time and resources to show up. They’re really dictating our future even though it’s not going to affect them. And that’s really frustrating. It’s like they were raised in a time of bounty and we don’t get a slice of the pie. They have the entire pie. I was born in Nicaragua and immigrated with my parents to the United States when I was really young. We lived in Miami for a few years, then in 2004 we moved to El Paso, Texas, and that’s where I grew up. Now I teach at an all-boys Catholic private school in California, and my kids are juniors—the age where they think they know everything and can get away with anything. Before the election this past November, some of them were asking me political things, like, “Yo, Mr. O”—that’s what they call me, Mr. O—“what do you think of Trump?” And I’d always say, “That’s not your business.” I’d tell them that the faculty handbook says I have to be nonpartisan. And one of them said, “But we need to know! Please don’t tell me you voted for Kamala!” And this was actually a Black student, by the way. Not that just because you’re Black, you should be voting for Kamala—it was just a little more unexpected. I come to find out that a lot of my students, and I mean a lot of them, are very conservative. Our school is very, very sports heavy. Our academics are amazing, don’t get me wrong—but sports are where it shines. Out of about 1,100 total students, maybe 900 are student athletes, and of course football is king. There was even a movie about our team that came out like a decade ago. I’ve been there three years now, but when I first started, I was this five-foot-eight, soft-spoken Hispanic teacher, and I’m teaching all these sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds who were six-foot-five, these enormous—like, what are they putting in the water here? Think of a hobbit in the Shire—that’s me, and everyone else is the elves. My first year, especially, was really hard because they could get very disrespectful. I had students yell at me, berate me just for asking them to put their phones away. It’s like, “Why am I being abused right now?” They wouldn’t necessarily make it obvious that it was because they think I’m less of a man or because I’m smaller. But I could tell it didn’t help. For a lot of these kids, their norm was coaches who would yell at them, which is not how I roll. There were days when I broke down in front of the students. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. It was like they were experimenting with dominance. And I mention all this because I think they really want that dominance to continue. I think they like getting away with talking very, very confidently. And I think they see Trump talking what I think is nonsense, but they’re like, “Oh, wow—he gets away with saying that!” And so they want to emulate that. They want that power. There was this friend group in my class that year—all of them were athletes for different sports, and they actually ended up becoming one of my favorite groups of students. The next year, they told me I was their favorite teacher. Even the ones who gave me a lot of issues said that. And I was like, “Wow, thank you—but if I’m your favorite teacher, why did you behave like this to me? Are you only going to follow the people who berate you? Are those the only people you’re going to respect? Because that’s kind of a crappy way to live, no?” And they said it was because my class was the only break they got from hard teachers and hard coaches. It was like a period of peace. They’d spend the rest of the day getting taught that weakness must be stamped out and eradicated. And then they meet me and I flip the whole thing on its head. Sometimes I do think to myself, Why am I like this? I’m not going to get anywhere being like this. I do get resentful sometimes. I’m not going to lie. I do feel—not marginalized, but I feel like when people think of men or masculinity, I’m not the image that comes to their head. I’ve always felt that way. At the same time, so many people, whether it be my classmates, my friends, my relatives, my students, my coworkers, everyone has said, “Jacinto, you’re one of the kindest people I’ve ever met—please don’t ever, ever change.” And it’s like, “Okay, see? So we do celebrate this other side of the coin. Sometimes.” When the election happened, I was so blindsided and distraught that for a month or so I just kind of turned that whole part of my brain off. I guess I live in a bubble, right? I go to NYU—a very liberal school, very performatively progressive, though I think the key word there is performative. But needless to say, I don’t have anybody close to me who voted for Trump or even considered voting for him. I guess that’s why I really thought Kamala was going to win. I wasn’t even that worried, because in my mind, I was like, We already went through four years of this douchebag. We know the type of person that he is. I just really thought that people were sick of him, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum. And then I was watching those numbers on election night, and that sinking feeling started, just like in 2016. I’m trying to make sense of it now. I’ve really tried to put myself in the mindset of just your average twenty-year-old Latino dude, because I know that’s where he gained a surprising advantage, and that shocked me the most. I guess a couple things jump out. Like, whether you like it or not, Trump does fall into that ultramasculine, ultra-fragile-ego archetype, and he disguises the fragility with machismo, with bravado, with boldness. Saying things with his chest. No matter how wrong he is, he carries this energy of absolute confidence. And I think that when you’re an impressionable young man, that’s appealing. It’s like, “I want to be a guy who’s not afraid to say whatever I want to say.” I’m the son of a Mexican immigrant who’s legal now—he has a green card—but for a while, he wasn’t. And I remember being a young kid in 2016 and hearing Trump say those things about Mexicans being rapists and criminals. And so obviously I’m like, That’s not who I am. That’s not who my father is. So in my mind, from a young age, there was an immediate fuck-you toward Trump. I identify with the immigrants from all these Latin American countries. I identify with that struggle. I see their pain. But not all Latino people, and especially not all Latino men, think that way. They feel like they’re citizens, they’re good, their family’s good. Whereas the people coming here now—they think they can just walk in, hand themselves over to border authorities, and then get shipped off to a sanctuary city without having to go through all of the pain that my family went through? That’s not fair. I definitely sense this sort of Democrat-­equals-good sentiment among my friends, but I very much do not identify with the Democratic Party. Seeing how people like Joe Biden were utterly indifferent to—actively in support of—Israel’s genocide, like, yes, on paper, at a glance, the Democratic Party has more of a progressive agenda, but in practice, do they? That was how I felt about Kamala, to be honest. Obviously I wasn’t going to vote for Trump—hell no, never—but I wasn’t a fan of Kamala, either. Her history, the fact that she was a prosecutor, that she put so many Black and brown people in jail—she kept showing she had no spine and no actual beliefs leading up to the election. I was debating who to vote for right up until I walked into that stall in the voting station—Harris or a third party. I voted for Kamala largely due to my mom, just how important her victory would’ve been for female reproductive rights and how catastrophic it would be if Trump won. And then he did. I need to make money and be self-­sufficient as soon as I can because my mom turns sixty next year, and if she’s still hustling and working her ass off at eighty, I’m going to feel like I failed. I’ve got to make sure that in some way, shape, or form, I can give back to my parents and start helping them out by the time I’m like thirty. That’s a big priority for me. And I don’t doubt that I’ll make money. I know I have skills, and it’s not like I’m just going to be sitting around. The doubt is about whether I can make enough to support my parents one day, to live an actually comfortable life, to have savings, a 401(k), a retirement plan. The doubt is about living a financially stable life as opposed to just living check to check or gig to gig. I will try my best, but I’m going to be honest, I know that the odds are not good. My generation is not in an optimal position. Honestly, it kind of feels like I was born too late. Like I missed out on something. It feels like I’m living in a generation where we’re cleaning up after someone else’s mess. I like to tell people I went to college undecided and I kind of came out the same way. I graduated in May of 2023. When I came home, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I moved back in with my parents, and that’s where I am now. My mom’s a school librarian, so she said, “Why don’t you try being a para-­educator?” And I said, “Well, I don’t have any other plans,” so now I help with third graders. It’s been a good year, and I’m grateful to have done it, but I don’t think I’d want to be a teacher. And being a para-educator is not a job where I’d be able to move out and afford rent and groceries and such. And you can’t really pay your bills with a philosophy degree. I play a lot of video games. This hat I’m wearing is from a game called Oblivion that came out in 2006. It’s like a fantasy role-playing kind of game. I’ve played several thousand hours throughout that series, and it’s like a lot of online spaces where you find young dudes—whether it’s video games or TV shows or Star Wars or sports or music or whatever. It’s not something you pick up on unless you’re in these spaces a lot. But take Star Wars: A lot of the top creators in those spaces are right-wing people talking about how some new Disney show is woke and bad, or how it’s forcing some lib agenda. Like, the most famous Star Wars YouTuber is a guy named Star Wars Theory, and most of his videos are just trashing all the new Star Wars shows for being DEI, whatever the term of the day is. In a lot of spaces that young men naturally gravitate toward, there’s already kind of a pipeline built, a feeling or environment of “This thing I like is under attack.” I don’t know who said it, but there’s a quote that sticks with me: “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality looks like an attack.” A lot of reactionary sentiment is built on nostalgia. And the Right in America has realized that you can weaponize that natural disenchantment with the world and spin it as: Something that you like is being attacked by the Left. And to me, it’s a uniquely right-wing phenomenon—the ability to infiltrate any space and be able to steer people toward that intellectual viewpoint. Once I noticed it, it was hard not to be aware of it. Whereas I think the Left, broadly speaking, does not have anything remotely equivalent. It’s the same tenor in these manosphere communities about women. I’ve only really had one serious relationship—a long story, but it didn’t work out. I’m not a big fan of the whole manosphere and red pill and all that stuff, but there were definitely times when I’d find myself scrolling on my phone, and I’d come across videos, obviously framed to show how women are bad, and I wouldn’t agree with them, but I could kind of say, at least for a little while, “Yeah, that’s how it feels.” It’s just a lot easier to feel like you’re the victim of some wrongdoing. And if you’re a young man who suffers some sort of ego injury, that online ecosystem is very easy to plug yourself into. That pipeline is ready and waiting. I want to be champion, bro. My life is very difficult right now, and I do that to myself. I have to make it. It’s not about plan B. It’s not about plan C, bro. This isn’t like wrestling or football where there’s scholarships to college. If you don’t make it in MMA, you’re back to square one. That’s kind of the thrill of it, too, if I’m being honest. I had a really tough upbringing, and it turned me into kind of a sad person. My dad’s from Cape Town in South Africa. I had neighbor kids who had all this cool shit, got to play video games for eight hours a day, or who lost a tooth and then the tooth fairy came and dropped a Nintendo DS under their pillow. I never had that stuff. We were living paycheck to paycheck. We couldn’t afford meat every day of the week. My father opened up this gym, but it didn’t make any money for eight years. So he worked another full-time job, and then he also fought a little bit. The gym’s super successful now, but it was tough, bro. Life’s tough. So Coeur d’Alene—I’m pretty sure they say it’s the fastest-growing city in the nation. I mean, it’s just crazy, bro. Like holy smoke. When my dad moved here for college, this was a one-stoplight town, and now it’s just a massive city. We get a ton of people from California who are like, “We don’t like our state anymore—it’s getting dangerous down there. So we’re going to go over to Idaho and change things.” Then they make it more like California. What they’re doing in the schools is just wrong. After Covid, the underclassmen just got progressively worse. Kids wearing weird stuff. Just really borderline satanic stuff. Weird colors. It’s gotten super free, in the wrong sense. Then after I graduated, they started doing the transgender bathroom stuff, so now they got a bathroom for them folks. So that is courtesy of the California people. I can’t name a Democrat in this gym right now. I can’t name a friend who’s a Democrat. I don’t know anybody who voted for Kamala, honestly—anybody that’s sober. Maybe some pothead buddies that aren’t really friends of mine. But the blue side is winning, dude. This younger generation—these kids are getting brainwashed into thinking blue. And blue is definitely not a righteous route. I mean, we still don’t have the full list of Epstein’s folks. A lot of these blue guys are just totally numb to the fact that there’s right ways and wrong ways to do things in life. They just don’t care. But common sense is coming back a little bit—that’s what I thought when Trump won. And I’m so thankful he won, because he says common-sense stuff, like building up the border wall. That sounds offensive, but it makes sense, because we all know where the drugs are coming from, and it’s not Canada. Also, I used to work in construction, so I see all these Hispanic folks that are working for nine or ten bucks an hour, and they’re doing double the work the Americans are doing, because they have to survive. Like, they actually are taking our jobs. They are. So I’m not a fan of immigration in that sense. The neighborhood where I grew up in Philadelphia—it wasn’t the worst, but it definitely wasn’t the best. My mother struggled through so much raising us. I learned from her that it’s okay to falter, but you can’t give up. I went to a horrible, underfunded public school. I wanted to be the first person in my family to graduate college, and I could see that my school wasn’t going to get me anywhere close. So I secretly applied to a private school that my mother didn’t know about. And they were so impressed that they reached out to me, gave me a tour, gave me a financial-aid package, and I started there my junior year. I went from a school that was like 98 percent Black to a predominantly white school—one of the best private schools in the country, where I got exposed to different opinions and learned how to challenge the current ideology that exists in any atmosphere. And that’s really guided me through my political transition to this day. A couple of years ago, like in 2020, 2021, I had blue hair. I was very far-left progressive. I protested for Black Lives Matter. I was 100 percent pro-choice. But the shift really began at this private school—all boys as well. In class we’d talk about things like the American Dream, and does it exist for African Americans? Everyone was saying the same thing: Systemic racism is the issue, and how horrible our country is. And just to be a contrarian, I said, “What if there are cultural or personal-responsibility issues that lead some people to fall short of their dreams? I went to a public school where I saw so many kids, the number-one obstacle in their lives wasn’t not having a father in their life—they just weren’t doing their homework.” The Black students at this private school, who were predominantly wealthy, found that offensive. They said, “You just got here, and you’re giving these white boys permission to think they’re right. You should just shut up.” They started a campaign of threatening me. If I sat next to them at lunch, they’d get up and walk away. I was completely iced out. I even got kicked out of the Black Student Union. They said, “If you come to another meeting, we’re going to have a problem.” And then all the slurs came. He’s an Uncle Tom. He’s just a Black mouth with white talking points. I’m very used to that now—if you call me those things, I don’t really care. But back then I felt like I was a horrible person, so I just bottled up all of my doubt. I basically had to neuter myself. One of the things I started to notice while I was arguing my leftist points to my conservative friends—like about getting vaccinated, supporting Trump—they would just ask me a lot of questions. They wouldn’t get mad at me. One of the conservatives I hated the most was Tucker Carlson, but I finally listened to one of his most controversial takes—about white replacement theory, and immigration—and I thought, “Look, I want to hate the guy, but I can’t really disagree with what he’s saying.” I’d been told for so long not to go look at these sources because they’re racist, they’re regressive, they’re harmful. And actually, it turns out I’m left wanting more. That’s when I did a full factory reset. I tried to relearn things from the ground up. When I look at most of the young men in my life, a lot of them are very sheepish about what they believe. They hold their beliefs to themselves. And conservatives have to talk in a certain way so they don’t alienate you, they don’t polarize, they don’t make it seem as if they’re trying to disrespect you. They’re always on the back burner trying to defend themselves. A few weeks ago in class, we had a group assignment, and this one girl in our group—I knew she was a feminist, I knew she was a control freak, and I knew she was going to sink our grade. But none of the guys in my group, including me, wanted to tell her no about anything. We didn’t want to speak over her. You could tell we were subconsciously teaming up to protect her from the idea that we were trying to mansplain to her, or that we were trying to hurt her feelings. And when I talk to older men who are in the corporate world, they do the same thing. We’re all holding ourselves back from our natural behavior. We’ve ceded so much power. Voting for Trump has made me more unyielding. I don’t necessarily care who I offend. I’m not doing it to harm you. I’m doing it because sometimes ideas have to offend people. They have to invoke some kind of passion. Out of all the hardest things someone can do in life, I think coming out of poverty is first. And then coming out of the progressive trap is probably second. This article appeared in the March 2025 issue of Esquiresubscribe I’m cisgender. I’m heterosexual. I’m not white, but I tick all the other categories that seem to form like the bad straw-man character on the Left, if you know what I mean. In these discourses you see on the Internet, on social media, you’ll have a lot of these left-wing influencers, these feminists just going on tirades against men—like, men are responsible for this, men are responsible for that, yada, yada, yada. Part of the reason why we’re experiencing a loneliness epidemic and we have all these crazy influencers like Andrew Tate out there is because we as a society, I think, have told men that they’re not valued and that whatever natural traits they exhibit are written off as toxic masculinity. We’re told to express ourselves, be vulnerable—but then the moment we are vulnerable, we’re still judged. Like, “Why are you that vulnerable?” Or if you grew up in a really tough, traditional, machismo family, you’re told the exact opposite: Keep everything in. So you either keep everything in and let that balloon grow and grow until one day it pops, or you try to let some of it out, get judged, and then never do it again. I’m not one of those manosphere guys or anything like that, but for a long time I did feel like, as a guy, I was kind of being sidelined. There was a time in my life when I considered myself pretty liberal, but then just the way I’d get shut down if I had a viewpoint that was maybe a little different—like, on abortion, there was a time in high school when I genuinely didn’t know what abortion was because my Indian parents never talked about it. I learned about it in school when Roe v. Wade got overturned. This one girl who I grew up with, I asked her, “Oh, what’s abortion? I don’t know what that is.” And she was like, “It’s when a pregnancy gets terminated.” And I was like, “What do you mean terminated? The baby dies?” And she was like, “Yeah, basically.” And I was like, “Well, isn’t that murder? Why would someone want to do that?” And she got super mad at me. She actually threatened to hit me. I’m a child of immigrants, but you seem to get more benefits as an illegal migrant than if you’re a citizen here. They get housed in hotels, they get debit cards, and yet there’s so many veterans on the streets who don’t get any of it. Last summer I applied for this internship at a major investment firm on their portfolio-management team, and I clicked on this scholarship application where they’ll give $20,000 toward your tuition. And I got an offer for an accelerated interview. So I tell my dad about it—an accelerated interview at the biggest asset manager in the world! And he was like, “What do you mean ‘accelerated interview’? They only give those to marginalized communities—they only give those to people who are LGBT and Black and Hispanic and all that.” He said, “You should email them and tell them you’re not one of those.” So I send an email. I tell them, “Hey, thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I should be interviewed in this way because I don’t fit into those categories.” They were like, “Okay, well, thanks for telling us.” And then a few weeks later, I got rejected. So my initial thought was like, Okay, so they were going to consider me because I ticked a few identity markers—but now that I don’t, they get rid of me? I still have this negative view of affirmative action because of it—because it’s like they were willing to lower the standard for me. It’s demeaning. And obviously you’re never going to be happy because—whether people say it out loud or not—you’ll always be seen as the guy who got in because there was a lower standard. I voted for Biden in 2020, and I voted for Trump in 2024. I didn’t like Trump back in 2020, and I still don’t really like him. He’s got the kind of persona that I despise—that kind of main character, center of the universe, got pampered a lot as a kid, all that. And he was definitely a sore loser in 2020. I voted against him in 2020 because I just didn’t like how the last four years went, the amount of polarization, the way he handled the pandemic. So I voted against him. And then this time I voted against Biden by voting for Trump. It’s ridiculous the way the Left has portrayed Trump as this threat to democracy when they’ve done a lot of things that are just as bad. Like, it was obvious they couped against Biden, and it’s not like they had an open primary where other Democrats could run. They just put Kamala in there. Then Biden pardoned his son after he said he wouldn’t. I also think the Justice Department is politicized. Sure, maybe Trump has some legit cases against him, but why are they trying to fish for everything they can? I definitely admire his resilience. He’s got all these court cases on him, all these convictions, and yet he’s still out there campaigning like crazy. Trump’s also got, what, two assassination attempts on him? Not to mention the entire media machine being against him, the entire political machine being against him, even Republicans. And yet he’s out there winning. There’s a lot of talking points in the world right now about a male loneliness epidemic. And for the most part, I would venture to say the people who focus on it tend to be right-wing grifters trying to make a buck off of male rage. That being said, many of the young men in my life—certainly not all, I wouldn’t even say most, but way, way more than I’d think is normal—have no close friends. Like, they have guys they go out and drink with. But if something is weighing on you, if your mom is sick, I could probably name three or four men in my everyday life who would have no one in their lives to speak to about that. That extends to their relationships with women. A disproportionate amount of the men in my life are single. I’m not a single guy, so I can’t speak to this personally, but I know there’s a lot of incel-­adjacent bitterness around that fact. These guys have spent their entire adult lives single and have grown to resent women for that. And it’s exacerbated when you go online, you go on YouTube and TikTok, and there are men reinforcing this idea that actually you’ve been right all along, you are right to be waiting for the “highest-value woman”—that’s what they call it—and every other woman who won’t date you, those women are bad. They’re sexually promiscuous, they’re ignorant, and you’re right to be angry at them. So many men are hearing this messaging and develop a sense of bitterness that drives them away from the women in their life—not just potential partners, but their mothers, their sisters. I try not to associate with people who harbor real bitterness for women, but I mean, I think about the way that some of them talk in my classes—men who take a gender-studies class just to dunk on the feminist talking points they hear. They view themselves as on some kind of crusade to be the logical voice of reason in the room. Like, in a moment of social reckoning, a moment of reorganization where there are more women in college than men, they view themselves as a last bastion, a final crusader in the quest to defend masculinity from an emasculating society. It’s a really sad thing. It’s embarrassing to watch. And if you asked those men in those lectures what they’re so angry about, they’d say they’re mad that their side of the story is not being told, when in fact their side of the story is the most well-­reported, well-documented, well-studied thing in the history of the world. In this election, it seemed like the Democrats were focusing on just women’s issues and women’s rights, we need a woman in office, everything just centered around women—and I am in no way degrading women, that’s fine—but they left out the entire other gender. There wasn’t anything for young men or pretty much men in general. It was just women’s this, women’s that. And for men, we’re like, “What about us?” The problem with today’s society, and especially with my generation, is everyone just focuses on, “Oh, men have had this and men have had that over the course of history.” They’ve had better benefits or they’ve gotten paid more. And what about women? What about women’s equality? Which I’m not opposed to—I do feel like women should be paid equally. Although if that’s what we want, then women need to start integrating themselves in the jobs that men naturally do. You’re not going to see a woman doing tile work. There’s not a single woman on the job sites that I work in. There’s not a single woman working in the coal mines or the oil rigs. If we want to have an equal society, then women need to start doing these jobs. At the end of the day, who Trump is as a person is not my concern. What he does in his daily life, the way that he acts, his whole demeanor, is not reflective of my opinions. It all goes back to what he will do to better the country. That’s what I’m concerned with—the things that affect my life. So his rants on Twitter and all that stuff, yeah, it’s stupid and I don’t agree with it. He should stop doing it. I mean, it’s kind of funny, but it’s also pretty stupid for a political leader to be ranting on Twitter like that. At the end of the day, though, it doesn’t affect me. What affects me is what he’s going to do for the country. All these Democrats keep saying he’s going to be the fall of America, which is just an idiotic remark to make, because if he was the fall of America, it would’ve fallen already. We still have our democracy, we still have our freedoms, we still have our right to believe in our own values and religion and anything that you want to believe in. I feel like Democrats just have this hatred for Trump himself. They don’t have a problem with what we as Republicans believe in. They just hate Trump. During the four years he was president, all they did was try to indict him, impeach him, get him out of office. And the last few years, they’ve been trying to put him in jail. It’s been really shocking to see what they were doing to him. The Democrats are always preaching about, “Oh, he’s going to be the fall of democracy and the end of America.” Yet they’re the ones inciting a world where you can decide someone’s unfit to be president just because you don’t like them. History will speak for itself, though. Because at the end of the day, in 2030, in a hundred years, whatever, our kids are going to be reading about Trump in their history books. You don’t need to like him as a person, but it’s undeniable the impact he’s had on the country. Whether it’s George Washington or Barack Obama or Donald Trump, our kids in future generations are going to know their names. What in the Mitch McConnell Is Going On?!

Title: How Goldman Sachs Doubling Down on Bitcoin ETFs Boosts New Crypto Like Meme Index
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-btc-etfs-bet-new-crypto-meme-index/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T10:15:36Z
Full Content:
New York-based banking titan Goldman Sachs has more than doubled its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ($BTC EFT) holdings. The company’s latest quarterly report reveals it now holds $1.57B in $BTC ETFs, more than twice its Q3 2024 value. Most of Goldman Sachs’ funds – over $1.25B – lie in BlackRock’s IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust). Sachs also holds a sizable chunk of Ethereum ($ETH) ETFs and other crypto options. Let’s unpack why this matters for the wider crypto market and for new crypto projects like Meme Index. In the previous quarter, Goldman Sachs reported it held $461M worth of IBIT shares, which made it the fund’s second-largest holder, only rivaled by Millennium Management with its $844M pile. Additionally, Sachs bought $288M worth of Fidelity’s FBTC (Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF). Its $3.6M GBTV (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) holdings, however, remained unchanged. Sachs’ other crypto options now total $760M, and its $ETH portfolio grew nearly 19x from $25.1M last quarter to $476.5M. Half of Goldman Sachs’ $ETH exposure is through Fidelity’s FETH (Fidelity Ethereum Fund) and half through BlackRock’s ETHA (iShares Ethereum Trust). Overall, the 12 $BTC ETFs saw $40.46B in net inflows since their launch. BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest fund with $40.87B in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $12.60B inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC suffered $21.95B outflows. The scale of $ETH ETF investments can’t compete with $BTC. Still, institutional interest is evident from $3.17B cumulative inflows. BlackRock yet again leads the pack with its ETHA fund ($4.44B inflows), while Grayscale’s ETHE falls behind with $3.95B outflows. While banking giants build their crypto portfolios, degen investors are reviving old-school TradFi concepts. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is rolling out the world’s first meme coin index. Essentially, it provides exposure to the $120B meme coin market through four baskets that cater to different risk appetites. Each of the baskets contains eight tokens, from OG memes like Dogecoin ($DOGE) to new, volatile players like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). By spreading investment across several projects, you offset potential losses and risk. The $MEMEX token presale kicked off in January and has already hit the $3.5M milestone. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0160993, but the price is set to increase tomorrow. Never before did degens have the opportunity to gain exposure to highly speculative assets in such a safe way. Given this unique positioning, $MEMEX could reach $0.074 by the end of 2025 and bring its supporters even greater gains in the long run. To buy $MEMEX, visit the official presale website, connect your wallet, and pay with $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or a bank card. Alternatively, secure your share of tokens through Best Wallet’s top presales aggregator. Goldman Sachs isn’t just dipping its toes in the crypto waters – it’s diving in headfirst. Wall Street heavyweights investing billions in crypto suggests it is now perceived as a legitimate asset class, which will surely drive broader adoption and innovation. Meanwhile, the crypto community is taking pages from Wall Street’s book, with creative solutions like $MEMEX providing a safer entry into the meme coin market for risk-averse investors. As always, though, we remind you to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. The market is notoriously volatile, and even tools like indexes don’t fully mitigate the risk.

Title: Report: Pro-Migration Lobbyists Plan to Surround, Submerge Donald Trump
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/02/12/pro-migration-lobbyists-plan-to-surround-submerge-donald-trump/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T09:48:58Z
Full Content:
A coordinated alliance of lobbyists are submerging President Donald Trump and selected GOP politicians under many close friends and allies who are urging them to import more low-wage and submissive migrants for jobs that would otherwise go to Americans who can vote in future elections, according to Business Insider. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com described the “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 [H-2A visa worker] guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” The campaign is called “Make America Wealthy Again,” said Business Insider, because it is”designed to appeal to Trump and his business-minded allies.” The headline is “Make America Wealthy Again: Inside corporate America’s ‘quiet’ campaign to change Trump’s mind on mass deportations.” The drive is also submerging congressional legislators under pro-migration voices and advocates, according to the article: In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. The campaign is a direct threat to Trump’s delicate coalition of businesses and employees, investors and families. A power grab by one faction may break the coalition — just as President Joe Biden’s presidency was quietly wrecked by his powerful alliance of pro-migration West Coast investors. The same pro-migration skew crashed the career and retirement plans of Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. It also smashed the career of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) twice lost the Majority Leader post because of his support for migration in 2014 and 2024. Outside Washington, a vast number of ordinary employees and family voters are increasingly opposed to illegal migration, and they carried Trump to victory — will help elect his successor in 2028. Moreover, many of the high-turnout voters needed in the off-year elections are increasingly opposed to the legalized inflow of white-collar Indian migrants via the H-1B and other visa programs. The H-1B program keeps roughly 730,000 foreign graduates in a wide variety of starter and experienced jobs throughout the Fortune 500. Without the H-1B program, those jobs would supercharge another generation of expert, outspoken, and innovative Americans in the leading edge of the U.S. economy. Overall, at least 1.6 million foreign graduates hold white-collar jobs via a variety of uncapped visa programs, such as the J-1, L-1, OPT, E-2, H4EAD, TN, and the H-1B program. Most of the visa workers graduate from low-grade universities, and many are chosen by lottery, so exploding the lobbyists’ claim that they are “highly skilled.” They cannot work as professionals because many are hired by foreign-born managers and all know they can be fired and sent home if they disagree with top managers. Many white-collar illegal migrants also hide in the growing workforce of migrant subcontractors. The result is a growing cascade of high-tech failures and disappointments in American companies and research centers. Those counterproductive programs have pushed millions of American college graduates out of good careers in technology, healthcare, management, and many other professions, and have crippled the innovation and flexibility of the U.S. tech sector. Other countries that also have tried to solve structural problems by importing migrants — Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom — have also quickly fallen behind. In contrast, young Chinese scientists and their companies have quickly earned leading roles in manufacturing technology, artificial intelligence, the auto sector, 5g communications gear, and drug development. The “MAWA” phrase is an elitist version of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Trump’s campaign slogan is only half of what Americans heard — yet many voters also heard him say “Make Americans Great Again” — not just America. If Trump resists pro-migration pressure from his friends, deputies, and donors, he may create a great America for Americans when a “tight labor” economy forces CEOs and investors to grow productivity, raise wages, risk more trade, and tolerate more innovation, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is already zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On December 28, for example, Musk slammed voters who oppose his use of the H-1B program to outsource U.S. jobs to India, saying: “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week when he meets with India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who is expected to demand more Indian immigration in exchange for U.S. exports to India.

Title: Bitcoin May See Gains from Soft U.S. CPI, Major Risk-On Surge in BTC Appears Unlikely

A soft U.S. inflation report later Wednesday will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). But those expecting bullish fireworks may be disappointed. The Labor Department will publish January's consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday at 13:30 UTC. It's expected to show that the cost of living increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January, slowing down from December's 0.4% rise, according to Reuters estimates tracked by FXStreet. The annualized figure is expected to match December's 2.9% reading. The core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have risen to 0.3% month-over-month from 0.2%, resulting in an annualized reading of 3.1%, down from December's 3.2%. Lower-than-expected data, particularly the core figure, will likely bolster expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts, which could lead to lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, ultimately boosting demand for riskier assets. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market currently estimates a 54% chance that the Fed will either cut interest rates once or not at all this year. While a potential adjustment in Fed rate cuts could lift BTC, it is unlikely to be the sole catalyst for a breakout from the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000. This is due to forward-looking market metrics indicating higher inflation in the coming months amid trade war fears, suggesting that the Fed may have a limited window to implement aggressive rate cuts. Data tracked by Mott Capital Management shows that two-year inflation swaps have climbed to nearly 2.8%, the highest since early 2023. The five-year swap is exhibiting a similar trend. Higher inflation swaps indicate that the market is expecting inflation rates to rise in the future, prompting investors to pay a higher premium to protect themselves against potential purchasing power loss by entering into swap contracts tied to CPI. In other words, the ongoing uptick in these metrics indicate that the progress in inflation toward the Fed's 2% target has stalled, and price pressures are likely to increase over the coming years, probably due to Trump's tariffs. Plus, some investment banks believe a soft January CPI reading won't see the Fed move away from its hawkish rate guidance. In his testimony to Congress Tuesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is in no hurry to cut rates. "We don’t expect that progress on inflation will be enough to prompt additional interest rate cuts from the Fed this year," RBC's weekly note said, adding that January's report will show limited easing in price pressures. BlackRock said the persistent services inflation will keep the Fed from cutting rates. "We get U.S. CPI for January this week. Even as December’s CPI report showed signs of inflation pressures easing, wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to recede back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer," BlackRock said. Lastly, BTC may move closer to the lower end of its $90K-$110K trading range should the CPI print hotter than expected.

The trio's collaboration, which was detailed by the MoonPay President Keith Grossman on the ”When Shift Happens” podcast, required MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright to “sign away his life” and the company to “promise” it had no liens on its reserve funds. “The volumes were just gigantic,” Grossman said, “All of the liquidity that we use to sort of wire the crypto was locked in BlackRock accounts in a traditional finance sort of manner… and it's Saturday.” How to borrow $160m in $USDC on a holiday weekend @KeithGrossman, president of enterprise at @Moonpay, reveals the crazy story behind how he managed to borrow $160m with @novogratz and @bgarlinghouse’s help in order to make sure the $TRUMP launch would succeed… And the… pic.twitter.com/8zKugL2idN — MR SHIFT 🦁 (@KevinWSHPod) February 11, 2025 The crypto funds it did have handy were being used up rapidly thanks to the Trump meme coin team’s direction that users could use mobile meme coin trading app, Moonshot, for which MoonPay is the exclusive crypto payments provider. Moonshot simplifies the meme coin buying process, allowing users to sign up with an email address, and allowing them to fund their accounts with credit or debit cards. The app eschews the complexities that crypto novices may face with trading on-chain via decentralized exchanges, making it an ideal option for newcomers. Therefore, when new users were looking to buy the TRUMP token on the app, they were exchanging their funds for MoonPay’s crypto reserves, notably stablecoin USDC, which was then used to purchase Trump’s meme coin on the Solana blockchain. If the company didn't have the liquidity to continue facilitating purchases of the token, then new consumers—of which MoonPay says it onboarded 750,000 of during the week of the TRUMP launch—may not have been able to gain access to the token. That may have hindered the token’s rapid growth in the early days, and impacted other MoonPay users as well. Grossman said the app would’ve said, “Sorry, doesn’t work,” had MoonPay run out of funds. To avoid the issue, Grossman said that he and Soto-Wright worked with MoonPay CFO Mouna Siala to forecast the amount of funds it would require, with the initial estimate of $50 million quickly doubling to $100 million after reevaluating the token’s growth in the first 24 hours. With its reserves locked in traditional financial systems, Grossman said he texted Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, and after a brief conversation, a loan was agreed upon and underway, forcing MoonPay’s teams to scramble on paperwork while verifying it had the funds to pay back a loan thanks to a connection through BlackRock. But the $100 million wasn’t enough. As demand continued to surge for TRUMP the following day, Grossman said that MoonPay turned to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “We underestimated the demand of this Trump token,” the MoonPay team told Garlinghouse, per Grossman. The Ripple chief agreed to help if MoonPay could get Novogratz to agree to the arrangement, given the previous deal in place—and ultimately, Grossman said, the additional $60 million was sent by Ripple to Galaxy, and then ultimately transferred to MoonPay. As traditional financial players came online in Europe and the United States on the following Monday and Tuesday, MoonPay was able to reestablish access to its funds, paying back its loans in full by Tuesday afternoon according to Grossman. The TRUMP token saw more than $20 billion in trading volume on average across its first five days after launch, according to data from CoinGecko, growing quickly to a fully diluted valuation of more than $73 billion in less than 48 hours. In the days after its launch, Trump’s meme coin gained spot listings from notable centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, further aiding the ability for inexperienced users to gain access to the token. A MoonPay representative confirmed to Decrypt that Grossman’s telling of the situation was accurate, though representatives from Galaxy and Ripple did not immediately reply to Decrypt’s requests for comment. TRUMP is now trading at $15.37, down more than 79% from its all time high.

Florida and North Carolina lead U.S. states in Bitcoin adoption with Senate Bill 550. Lawmakers aim to allocate public funds into Bitcoin. As discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin [BTC] Reserve gain traction in the U.S., several states are already exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Florida is emerging as a frontrunner, with lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 550, aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s public investment strategy. Introduced by Senator Joe Gruters, the bill seeks to authorize Florida to allocate up to 10% of specific public funds into Bitcoin. This positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a means of increasing financial autonomy. The Florida Bill SB 550 proposal noted, “Throughout its history, Bitcoin has greatly risen in value and is becoming more widely accepted as an international medium of exchange, and countries around the world, including the United States, hold Bitcoin within their treasury departments […] The bill further noted, Bitcoin is viewed as a hedge against inflation by sovereign nations and prominent investment advisors, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton […] The state should have access to tools such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation.” If enacted, the legislation would empower the state’s Chief Financial Officer to manage Bitcoin holdings through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or direct ownership. Beyond its potential economic benefits, the initiative signals a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level, reinforcing its role as a viable asset. Florida isn’t alone in its Bitcoin push, as interest in cryptocurrency adoption is growing beyond U.S. borders. North Carolina and South Dakota are also actively exploring Bitcoin investments, joining a growing list of states considering digital asset reserves. In North Carolina, the House Speaker’s staff recently engaged with industry advocate Dan Spuller, who asserted that the state aims to secure the “top spot” in Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart is pushing for legislative action, emphasizing that “now is one of the few chances government has at being proactive.” Hence, with at least 18 states currently assessing Bitcoin investments, the momentum for state-level adoption of cryptocurrency continues to build. That being said, a recent Reuters report highlights a surge in crypto usage across South America, particularly in Brazil, where digital assets are playing an increasingly prominent role in financial transactions. Gabriel Galipolo, Brazil’s Central Bank Chief, noted that the country has witnessed a significant rise in cryptocurrency adoption over the past three years, with stablecoins emerging as the preferred choice for payments. While this reflects a shift toward decentralized financial systems, it also raises concerns among regulators regarding oversight and financial stability. Speaking at an event in Mexico City, Galipolo emphasized the need for a balanced regulatory framework to address these challenges while fostering innovation in the digital asset space. He said, “Most of that is to buy things and to shop things from abroad. [This] maintains some kind of opaque vision for taxation or for money laundering.” Thus, as the momentum for state-backed Bitcoin reserves gains traction, Utah is emerging as one of the top states in passing formal legislation on the matter. In fact, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, recently suggested that Utah could be the first state to successfully implement such a policy. Additionally, in a discussion with “Simply Bitcoin” and Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter revealed that 11 states have already introduced bills to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, with expectations that this number could rise to 15 by year-end. This growing interest underscores a broader shift toward Bitcoin’s role in state financial strategies, signaling a potential wave of adoption that could reshape traditional investment models across the U.S. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has named a 40-player extended squad ahead of the 2025 Women’s Six Nations which gets under way next month. Ireland will kick-off their Championship in Belfast on March 22nd, hosting France at Kingspan Stadium. Bemand has included eight uncapped players in the squad, including Sophie Barett, Jane Neill, Beth Buttimer and Jane Clohessy who impressed for the Ireland under-20s last season. Making the jump to senior from the Ireland under-18s panel is Alma Atagamen, while Amy Larn, Katie Heffernan and Caitriona Finn round out the uncapped contingent. Last season’s co-captain Sam Monaghan misses out through injury. “We’re delighted to select a really strong blend of 40 players to assemble and prepare for the start of the Guinness Women’s Six Nations, while also building towards Rugby World Cup 2025,” said Bemand, announcing the squad on Tuesday. “We’ll come together in Dublin next Monday and reconnect as a group, laying the foundations for the opportunities ahead. “Following on from successes during the WXV1 campaign in Vancouver, we have been impressed by the hard work and application of the players as they have returned to club action in recent months. “The focus and determination of players as they’ve attacked Celtic Challenge training with the Clovers and Wolfhounds has been particularly pleasing, and a number of players have earned their opportunity in National Camp off the back of those performances as we grow our wave. “We showed positive growth and evolution over the course of 2024 and the group are excited to get back in together to continue that work as we look towards the opening game against France in Belfast, which will provide a big challenge for us but we’re relishing the opportunity to perform in green while taking the home support along with us.” Forwards (22): Alma Atagamen (Balbriggan RFC)* Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Beth Buttimer (UL Bohemian RFC)* Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Christy Haney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Claire Boles (Railway Union RFC/Ulster) Cliodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs) Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (Old Belvedere RFC/Munster) Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster) Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC) Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby) Jane Clohessy (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster)* Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury) Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke RFC/Ulster) Siobhán McCarthy (Worcester Warriors/Munster) Sophie Barrett (Railway Union RFC/Ulster)* Backs (18): Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster) Amy Larn (Athy RFC)* Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC) Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Caitríona Finn (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC) Enya Breen (Blackrock College RFC/Munster) Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC) Katie Corrigan (Old Belvedere RFC) Katie Heffernan (Railway Union RFC/Leinster)* Méabh Deely (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster) Nicole Fowley (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC) Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC) *uncapped players March 22nd: Ireland v France, Kingspan Stadium, Belfast – 1pm March 30th: Italy v Ireland, Stadio Sergio Lanfrachi, Parma – 3pm April 12th: Ireland v England, Virgin Media Park, Cork – 4.45pm April 20th: Wales v Ireland, Rodney Parade, Newport – 3pm April 26th: Scotland v Ireland, Hive Stadium, Edinburgh – 12.15pm Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/who-owns-world-boom-bust-bailout-process-placed-nations-debt/5879666
Time Published: 2025-02-11T15:42:36Z

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business. By 2000, that number was down to six corporations, with directorates interlocked with each other and with major commercial banks.[23]” For more information see also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

It’s a trend that is already heating up in aerospace. Take Archer Aviation, a California-based startup building eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles). Until very recently, Archer’s go-to-market strategy was an air taxi network across several cities in the U.S. and abroad. Archer’s focus is now more acutely on defense, and it has attracted fresh capital to further that mission. The company, which went public in September 2021 via a special purpose acquisition merger (SPAC), on Tuesday announced a $300 million equity raise from institutional investors like BlackRock and Wellington. The raise brings Archer’s total funding to around $3.36 billion. This fresh capital comes off the back of a $430 million round in December to fund its new Archer Defense program. As part of that program, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. Together, the two are targeting a program of record from the Department of Defense, which is a budgeted acquisition program with guaranteed funding over a set period. “As we dug into the work we were doing on the defense front, we realized that the market was a lot larger than we initially expected, both in terms of scope as well as timing,” Nikhil Goel, Archer’s chief commercial officer, told TechCrunch. “We’re the only company in the space that I think is targeting a sizable defense program of record,” Goel continued. “So we really want to be strategic with the investments we’re making and go full steam ahead on this.” Rivals in the space like Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies also have military contracts to test their aircraft for surveillance, logistics, and reconnaissance missions. Archer has such contracts with the military, but what it’s chasing now via the program of record is guaranteed funding, a path to scale, and a serious competitive moat. Goel confirmed that the $300 million from investors will mainly be used to accelerate the work Archer is doing with Anduril to build a hybrid craft (VTOL), though he didn’t share any updates on the company’s bid with the DOD. Archer’s decision comes at a moment of industry momentum. The Trump administration has vowed to “rapidly field emerging technologies” like AI, drones, and counter-drone systems to modernize the military. The very qualities that make eVTOLs perfect for urban and regional flight are also attractive for defense use cases. Cruising at 300 feet, Archer Aviation’s electric aircraft, Midnight, makes less noise than a passing car on the highway. In an urban environment, it blends into other transportation sounds in a way that helicopters cannot. “The sound profile is why we are so well positioned to [build aircraft] for defense,” Goel said. “If you look at the traditional helicopters that the defense industry uses, they’re very loud and have very noticeable heat signatures. And so that makes helicopters not a great fit for more discreet missions.” Archer’s Midnight is built with 12 sets of engines and propellers – six in the front, six in the back. That distributed propulsion among smaller rotors that spin slightly slower — rather than a single large main rotor and tail rotor that operate at high speeds — creates much less noise. VTOLs are also designed to transition from a vertical lift to a winged horizontal flight like an airplane. When in forward flight, the Midnight generates all the lift from the wing, rather than from downward thrust, which also reduces overall rotor noise, Archer’s CEO and founder Adam Goldstein told TechCrunch during a recent flight demonstration. While Archer is gunning to supply the defense industry with aircraft, the company still intends to launch its first limited commercial air taxi network in late 2025 in the United Arab Emirates. In 2026, Archer says it will expand air taxi services to several other cities and countries, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, South Korea, and India. The company has partnered with major airlines to facilitate air taxi networks like United, Southwest, and IndiGo. In November 2024, a joint venture from Japan Airlines and Sumitomo conditionally agreed to purchase up to $500 million worth of electric aircraft from Archer. But 2026 isn’t that far away, and Archer has pushed out its timelines before. That’s partly because Archer is still working toward validating the safety of its eVTOLs and securing the necessary certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. In the U.S., eVTOL companies need to secure type certification to approve the design of an aircraft, production certification to prove they can mass-produce a vehicle that meets its approved design, and airworthiness certification to ensure an aircraft is safe for flying. Goel says Archer is far along in the process for those certifications but has yet to receive any of them. Nor has Archer flown with a pilot in its aircraft yet, which is a necessary step toward testing the aircraft with passengers. He adds that Archer will put a pilot in one of its Midnights “imminently.” The process of certifying aircraft and scaling production is an expensive one. Construction on Archer’s Georgia factory, built with its strategic investor, Stellantis, is nearly complete, with production expected to begin this quarter. Archer hopes to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030. For this year, though, Archer’s goal is to produce eight to 10 aircraft between the Georgia facility and its prototype facility in California. Goldstein told TechCrunch back in October that most of the capital expenditures to get the factory up and running have already been spent, so the focus is on scaling Midnight eVTOLs while also developing the hybrid defense aircraft. Today’s raise brings Archer’s total liquidity to well over $1 billion, extending its runway for “multiple years” through commercialization and the initial phases of defense work, according to Goel. Archer has yet to share its 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, but the company’s total operating expenses hit $385 million in the first three quarters of the year, or $281 million on an adjusted basis. Archer anticipated adjusted operating expenses for Q4 to be between $95 million and $110 million. It’s not yet clear how much Archer’s development of a hybrid aircraft for warfare will increase the company’s expenses.

Title: Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus

Time Published: 2025-02-11T13:30:03Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 08:30 EST / FEBRUARY 11 2025 by Duncan Riley Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. announced today that it has raised $300 million in new funding via an equity capital raise. The $300 million in funding, raised through a securities purchase agreement, came from Blackrock Inc. and other leading institutional investors. The funding will be used to strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow the company to accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform, particularly for defense applications. While perhaps better known for its attempts to bring a flying taxi to market — which it is still pursuing — Archer has more recently shifted much of its focus to the defense sector. The company announced that it had signed a partnership with Anduril Industries Inc., a startup active in the defense sector, in December, alongside an announcement that it had raised $430 million to develop military aircraft. Archer’s main offering, be it one still under development, is an electric flying taxi dubbed Midnight. The aircraft offers vertical takeoff and landing and is powered by propellers that can cover up to 100 miles per trip at a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Notably, Archer signed a $142 million contract to deliver six Midnights to the U.S. Air Force in July 2023. The aircraft, which can carry approximately 1,000-pound payloads, offers the U.S. military a rapid response aircraft with effectiveness across a wide range of mission profiles, from personnel transport and logistics support to rescue operations and more. As part of its shift into defense, Archer also launched a dedicated unit, Archer Defense, to develop next-generation aircraft for defense applications. The first product from the division is planned to be a hybrid-propulsion vertical-take-off-and landing aircraft. The proceeds from the equity raise today are planned to be used for the development of next-generation aircraft manufacturing capabilities related to the new aircraft, including batteries and composites, with the remainder of the funding going for general corporate purposes. “The opportunity for advanced vertical lift aircraft across defense appears to be substantially larger than I originally expected,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Adam Goldstein. “As a result, we are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to capture this opportunity and more.” THANK YOU Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus EMERGING TECH - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 MIN AGO F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures AI - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 2 HOURS AGO Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches INFRA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 5 HOURS AGO Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 8 HOURS AGO Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 14 HOURS AGO NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 14 HOURS AGO

Posted on 02/11/2025 5:23:56 AM PST by hardspunned KYIV, Feb 11 — US President Donald Trump floated the idea that Ukraine "may be Russian someday”, as his Vice President JD Vance gears up to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later this week. Pushing for an end to the nearly three-year war with Russia, Trump discussed the conflict in an interview with broadcaster Fox News that aired yesterday. "They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said. Trump also emphasised reaping a return on investment with US aid to Ukraine, suggesting a trade for Kyiv’s natural resources, such as rare minerals. (Excerpt) Read more at malaymail.com ...

Their hatred for Ruzzia blinded them from reality. Reality is about to slap them in the face. And it’s going to leave a mark. Who is going to push Ruzzia out of Territory it has won in Ukieland? “...floated the idea that Ukraine may be Russian someday...” It was Russian before. wy69 Maybe Putin can be induced to take coup-plotter Victoria Nuland off our hands. No death penalty in Russia! The ever changing world of big power spheres of influence. It’s common sense and the way of the world. The Donbass has changed hands at least 20 times since 1914. To try to freeze that ever, for the last millennia, evolving area in a warped Soviet engineered ethnic caldera is madness. To nearly blunder into WWIII over it is the most insane thing I’ve ever witnessed in my lifetime. Most European borders were constantly changing due to wars, its what eventually led to the worldwide conflicts of WW1 and WW2. It's life -- not madness. The USA has.... -invaded, blockaded, and sanctioned Cuba -invaded and taken over Hawaii -invaded Mexico and took what is now a large part of the southwest US -attempted but lost same in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afganastain -took/stole native Indians' territory and hereded them into reservations. And on and on and on....Get real! It's life -- not madness.

And on and on and on....Get real! And on and on and on....Get real! Get real! The iron law of history! If you aren’t strong enough to keep it, you don’! Without looking up on the Internet, name one Britannic tribe? You don’t like our history or apparently any history so please leave! That’s a long term possible solution. Who is Zelensky going to Con to push Ruzzia out now? There was never a Peace deal in the Countries you mentioned. Big Difference. The USA has.... -invaded, blockaded, and sanctioned Cuba -invaded and taken over Hawaii -invaded Mexico and took what is now a large part of the southwest US -attempted but lost same in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afganastain -took/stole native Indians' territory and hereded them into reservations. And on and on and on.... Get real! Since WW2, all countries have signed the UN Charter promising to settle border disputes peacefully, in the UN. Or do you believe we should "Get real" and have all world border disputes settled by invasions? Which is madness. Or do you believe we should "Get real" and have all world border disputes settled by invasions? Which is madness. Yep, you're pretty much right. How about being strong and not bullying and trying to change the rest of the world to our liking? Why is that our job? Why can't we be strong and take care of our own instead of dictating to and invading countries all over the planet? Is that such a strange notion to you? We spend our precious resources taking on the rest of the planet while countries like China and others focus on their own and not take on the rest of the world. Why do they have better math and science education systems and challenge the world with better products and production capabilities -- while we spend massive sums on worldwide military bases and invasions around the world they're not burdened with? Hell, we're $35 trillion in debt and growing, which can lead to all kinds of very unpleasant and dangerous outcomes -- including collapse. We attempt to save the world at the cost of our own country. Yep. That makes lots of sense, doesn't it?You don’t like our history or apparently any history so please leave! It's not about not liking our history and ALL ABOUT "the pot calling the kettle black." We've done all the things and more that we now preach to the world that THEY should NOT do! In other words, "do as I say, not do as I do." History is strewn with perfect examples of civilizations that outran their headlights, like the Great British Empire (GONE), The Roman Empire (GONE), and many others. Is that where you want us to be? Yep, you're pretty much right. How about being strong and not bullying and trying to change the rest of the world to our liking? Why is that our job?
