Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo credit: Flystock/Shutterstock June 10 (Reuters) – The sale of two ports near the Panama Canal to a global consortium led by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) threatens the canal’s principle of neutrality, the canal’s head Ricaurte Vasquez told the Financial Times. “There is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,” Vasquez told the FT in a report published on Tuesday. “If there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama’s competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.” MSC is one of the world’s top container shipping groups. MSC and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal CK Hutchison confirmed last month that MSC, run by the family of Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports, including the two ports in Panama, for $22.8 billion. The clarification follows weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China over CK Hutchison’s plan to sell the ports to a consortium, which was previously led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. BlackRock remains part of the group. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Vasquez added that the canal should use the ports deal as an opportunity to become a terminal operator itself by reactivating a project to build a terminal in the Port of Corozal at the Pacific end of the canal, according to the FT.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Frenzy: BlackRock’s Speed Run To $70 Billion Shakes The Market
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrocks-speed-run-to-70-billion-shakes-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-06-10T14:30:46Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has hit a new high. It reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 trading days. That makes it the fastest fund ever to cross that line. Investors poured in at a pace few expected. And the milestone shows how much appetite there is for regulated Bitcoin products. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT “blew through $70 billion” on June 9. That run is roughly five times quicker than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 trading days to hit the same mark. IBIT now manages about $71.9 billion and holds 661,457 BTC. It sits ahead of Binance, with 629,190 BTC, and Michael Saylor’s Strategy at 582,000 BTC. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 Based on reports from Farside Analytics, IBIT led all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs since its January 2024 debut. It attracted nearly $49 billion in net inflows, dwarfing rivals. Yet not every day has been smooth. After a 31-day streak of fresh money, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow—$431 million—on May 30. That shift is a reminder that these funds still move with Bitcoin’s own ups and downs. At the current pace, BlackRock could hold more Bitcoin than its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by next summer. Addresses tied to Nakamoto are estimated to control around 1.1 million BTC—about 5% of the total 21 million coins. If IBIT reaches that level, one single firm would match the original stash. It’s a sign of how big institutions are moving into a market once ruled by individuals. IBIT shares traded at $61.77 at the time of writing. That’s up 5.30% over the past week, as Bitcoin’s spot price climbed back toward $110,000. When Bitcoin spikes, the ETF follows. When it dips, the fund can see outflows. In an interview last week, Blockstream CEO Adam Back opined that most individuals require an easy means of acquiring Bitcoin. According to him, most newcomers are unaware of how to configure wallets or manage private keys. However, he also cautioned against keeping “90% of it in ETFs” as it would introduce new risks. His opinion reflects the conflict between access convenience and the preservation of Bitcoin’s original design. BlackRock’s blockbuster ETF is a watershed for crypto. It reflects wealthy demand from institutional investors and brings Bitcoin within more mainstream accessibility. But it raises new questions about who controls the keys and how that power might shape markets.

Title: Circle Stock To $300?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Representation of cryptocurrency and Circle logo displayed on a screen in the background are seen in ... More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE: CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has rapidly emerged as one of the market’s most watched stories following its IPO. Currently trading around $115 — a significant increase from its IPO reference price of $31 — the company has attracted substantial institutional support and increasing public interest from investors. With the crypto-fintech sector gaining momentum and regulatory clarity becoming more apparent, many are now asking: could Circle ultimately reach $300 per share? But there is a downside case, too. See: Can Circle Stock Drop 80%? Also, check out What’s Better - Circle Stock Or Bitcoin? Additionally, See: How Can Circle’s Revenue Grow By 3x? Circle’s current primary revenue source is derived from the yield produced by the reserves supporting USDC, which now has a circulating supply close to $60 billion. These reserves, mainly invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries, generate dependable, scalable interest income — providing a foundational revenue stream. In 2024, Circle reported over $1.5 billion in revenue, primarily from interest earned on these reserves. If USDC’s circulation grows to $150–200 billion over the next three to five years — a feasible scenario given the surge in global demand for stablecoins — Circle’s reserve income alone could reach $4–5 billion annually. In addition to passive income, Circle’s product roadmap features enterprise-grade APIs for programmable payments, digital identity layers, FX rails, and on-chain treasury services. This infrastructure-first strategy positions Circle similarly to a “Stripe for digital dollars.” With substantial traction in these services, Circle could generate $2–3 billion in additional revenue from software-like recurring sources. Combining this with reserve yield, total revenue could grow to $6.5–8 billion annually within five years. See - How Circle can 3x its Revenues. Circle’s capital-light operational model allows it to scale profitably. Despite high partner distribution expenses — such as payments to Coinbase — its underlying margin profile remains robust. Over time, net margins in the range of 25–30% are likely as the business diversifies and gains more control over customer relationships. If net income reaches $1.8–2.4 billion, and Circle holds 300–350 million shares outstanding post-IPO, the company could achieve earnings per share (EPS) in the $6.00–8.00 range. At a price of $300 per share, Circle would have a market capitalization in the range of $45–50 billion. This would correspond to a price-to-earnings multiple of 40–50x, which is in line with the valuation of rapidly growing, high-margin fintech platforms — especially those developing enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, or legacy Visa during its earlier growth phase). In this situation, Circle would be valued not just for growth, but for being a unique crypto-native company with strong compliance, significant partnerships (e.g., BlackRock, Visa), and a pivotal role in the tokenization of real-world assets. A share price of $300 for Circle is not merely a bullish aspiration — it represents a goal that illustrates the company’s desire to become the digital financial infrastructure layer of the internet. To achieve this, Circle must increase the circulation of USDC, enhance its platform services, and demonstrate its ability to generate stable earnings at scale — all while maintaining regulatory credibility. If this vision becomes a reality, Circle won’t just be a stablecoin company — it will be a fundamental component of the financial system of the future. In such a landscape, a price of $300 may not signify overvaluation, but rather a fair valuation. Investing in a single stock like CRCL carries risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which contains 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. What’s the reason for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less volatile experience, as shown by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. India is a sizzling market for private credit, though some participants are wondering if in their eagerness to close deals, investors are shutting their eyes to risks, especially the legal minefields around collateral and bankruptcy. A decade ago, India’s banks were struggling with the world’s biggest load of soured corporate loans. At about $200 billion, the write-offs on that exposure have been large. Deposit-taking institutions that tried to recover the debt via insolvency proceedings have had to accept harsh haircuts. Traditional lenders are so scared by that experience that personal credit, which was less than half of banks’ advances to industry 10 years ago, is now 1.5 times as large and growing nearly twice as fast. Credit demand and supply have changed in other ways, too. Large firms, traditionally the heaviest users of bank financing, seem the least interested in project finance. They are borrowing selectively to fund acquisitions and refinance existing debt rather than to create new capacity. Also Read: Finance in India has a new bogey called private credit Startups and their founders are far more eager to raise debt, though that’s mostly because venture capital funds have become stingy. Initial public offerings are being delayed in a slowing economy, and equity valuations for many unlisted firms are cooling off. Non-bank financiers, too, are starved for funding. Banks have turned cautious about these firms’ exposure to overleveraged households. This is a perfect scenario for non-traditional lenders—global insurers, asset managers and sovereign wealth funds—to fill in the void left by banks and pocket a cool 18-20% return. Värde Partners, Oaktree Capital Management and Davidson Kempner are among the most aggressive, though everyone from BlackRock to Allianz Global Investors is participating enthusiastically in the deal-making. Local players appear quite miffed. Even though they’re in on many small loans, the foreign money deluge is cutting them out of marquee transactions. Domestic private-credit ventures, especially those affiliated with banks, are also keen to earn high rates of return on capital. But they’re more interested in the return of capital. Some of them have struggled to raise funds because they aren’t seen as bold enough. Also Read: Much more private credit will be needed to feed India’s rapid economic expansion Their foreign rivals, meanwhile, lack neither capital nor courage. As a few prominent Mumbai financiers told me, overseas institutions may be mispricing the true credit risk, which won’t end well. Greed may hurt foreign investors, who will then cry that it’s hard to get repaid in India. Some already are. In 2021, US lenders gave $1.2 billion to Indian entrepreneur Byju Raveendran for his eponymous online education venture, then the country’s most valuable startup. Now Byju’s has collapsed and the money is largely gone. Creditors will be lucky to get even a few cents on the dollar from bankruptcy proceedings in India. And yet, Byju’s is no longer a cautionary tale in a gung-ho market. Creditors are chasing special situations, such as a nephew who needs a hefty loan to buy out an uncle. The other opportunity is in restructuring. Last month, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, a real estate and construction conglomerate, raised $3.4 billion from Deutsche Bank and other investors to refinance previous high-cost debt. This deal, a new record for India’s private-credit market, has raised eyebrows. Although repayment is due in three years, the yield on the zero-coupon bond is as high as 19.75%. The collateral is also tricky. The deal is reportedly backed by about $3.6 billion of real estate and investments in oil and gas. The crown jewel is a 9.2% stake in Tata Sons, valued at roughly $18.6 billion. Also Read: Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate rejigs top deck, appoints dual CEOs But how will value from the holding company of Tata Group, whose listed units are worth $325 billion, ever be realized? Shares in privately held Tata Sons aren’t freely transferable. That’s the official position of the charitable trusts that are its majority shareholders. Maybe investors are betting that the trusts will eventually relent or that they will buy out Shapoorji, the largest minority shareholder. Neither outcome can be predicted with any degree of certainty.The bold bet shines a light on the buccaneering spirit that has taken over India’s nascent private-credit industry. Policymakers would want to see more risk-taking in creation of new assets. India’s new central bank chief has slashed interest rates, reducing the repo rate by a more-than-expected half percentage point on Friday. He has also flooded the financial system with liquidity. But given the cloudy outlook for global trade and local consumption, corporate investment isn’t India Inc’s priority. Swapping assets among one another is. As for the money, there are enough private lenders willing to write checks of $100 million or more. And if they don’t, someone else will. ©Bloomberg The author is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia.

The company’s asset management joint venture with BlackRock had earlier announced its complete leadership team and unveiled a digital-first investment platform. The stock opened higher at ₹305.80 and touched an intraday high of ₹306.85 before paring gains, currently trading below Monday’s closing price of ₹304.25. Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal joint venture between Jio Financial and NYSE-listed BlackRock, named key executives across critical functions. Sid Swaminathan continues as managing director and CEO, while new appointments include Gaurav Nagori as COO, Amit Bhosale as chief risk officer, and Amol Pai as chief technology officer. The company launched early access registration for its digital-first platform, offering educational content on investment fundamentals ahead of the official product launch. Swaminathan indicated the platform would eventually feature investment products incorporating BlackRock’s data-driven investing capabilities. The leadership announcement follows SEBI’s approval for the joint venture, which had initially boosted Jio Financial shares nearly 4 per cent on Monday. However, Tuesday’s trading suggests investor enthusiasm may be cooling despite the strategic developments in the company’s asset management business. The broader market indices continued their fourth consecutive day of gains, adding approximately 35 basis points from Friday’s levels. The stock closed flat on the NSE at ₹302.40.

Title: More Crypto IPOs Are Coming: 3 Initial Public Offerings To Watch For

More the Wall Street - New York Stock Exchange logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Circle, the issuing company of the USDC Stablecoin, went public last week under the ticker “CRCL”. The company’s stock surged over 168% during its first day of trading, blowing investor expectations out of the water. Their wildly successful listing will likely trigger a rush of additional crypto companies to list or accelerate their plans to go public. I’ve put together a list of the top 3 crypto-related public listings that will likely make headlines in the months to come. Before we get to the list, let’s quickly review the numbers of Circle’s recent listing to grasp just how impressive the outcome was for its investors. Circle first announced its plans to go public on May 27th, 2025, though the company had filed for an S-1 registration with the SEC back in January 2024, which signalled its intention to go public. The company was initially targeting to raise $624 million by offering 24 million shares as part of its listing transaction. During the road show, the price was estimated at $24-$26 per share. Due to strong demand, the company increased the offering to 32 million shares at $27-$28 per share, upping the amount raised to $896 million. Even at the increased valuation, the company received 25 times more demand for the shares than expected, meaning the deal was 25 times oversubscribed. To put this in context, this implies that there was demand for ~850 million shares vs the 34 million that Circle was offering for sale. Part of the excitement came from the fact that ARK Invest and Blackrock had strong demand to invest. Circle finally penned the deal by selling 34 million shares at $31 per share, raising a total of $1.05 Billion and valuing the company at $8.1 Billion on a fully-diluted basis. During the first day of trading, the company’s share price rose by 168%, closing the day at $81.69. This valued the company at ~$20 billion. While the excitement around Circle’s IPO is partly rooted in the optimism surrounding U.S. dollar pegged stablecoins, the deal also implies strong investor interest to participate in the future of the digital economy that’s being built around Bitcoin and digital assets. You can bet that other companies in the space are observing the deal with optimism and will likely work to accelerate their plans to list this year. Here are the top 3 companies that have announced or reported plans to list in the months ahead: Gemini As reported three days ago, the U.S.-based crypto exchange owned by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the U.S.. In terms of projected valuation, the company has not yet reported a price, but its last priced round back in November 2021 valued the company at $7.1 Billion. The estimated listing date is late 2025 or early 2026. Kraken The San Francisco-based exchange has also been reportedly getting ready for an IPO in early 2026, although no formal registration has been filed. The company’s last priced round was all the way back in 2019, when it raised $13.5 Million at a $4 Billion valuation. The company has reportedly been working with banks to complete a debt offering to boost growth ahead of the listing. Bitgo Back in February the U.S. based custodian was reported to be eyeing an IPO “as early as this year”, though no formal registration has been filed yet. Bitgo’s last priced round was done in August 2023, valuing the company at $1.75 Billion. These are just three companies-- after Circle’s warm welcome, you can bet that there will be more announcing plans to list soon. In a market where Bitcoin Treasury company stocks and Bitcoin ETFs are performing so well, equity from companies that provide the infrastructure for the industry seems like a logical next step.

Title: Bitcoin climbs back to $110k amid sustained corporate, institutional interest

Bitcoin surges past $110k as institutional demand grows on back of strong ETF inflows amid easing geopolitical tensions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded above $110,000 on June 9, regaining ground lost in last week’s selloff as investors rotated back into digital assets on the back of strong ETF inflows, easing macroeconomic tensions, and renewed optimism across risk markets. The world’s largest crypto reached an intraday high of $110,653 from a daily low of $105,426 earlier in the day during Asia and UK trading sessions. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,200, up 4.10% over the past 24 hours. The sharp climb comes amid strong demand from institutional and corporate buyers, especially via spot Bitcoin ETFs, as a key driver behind the move. Additionally, easing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, as well as momentum on a US Bitcoin reserve renewed optimism in the market. Spot exchange-traded crypto funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, and other major US firms have collectively seen over $11 billion in inflows over the past seven weeks, solidifying Bitcoin’s inclusion into traditional financial portfolios. On-chain data shows that BTC reserves on centralized exchanges continue to decline, suggesting reduced selling pressure even as prices rise. The latest move may also restore investor confidence after the asset failed to hold above $108,000 in earlier sessions this week. Bitcoin’s rally also coincides with fresh accumulation from high-profile firms. Strategy confirmed a recent purchase of 1,045 BTC between June 2 and June 6. Meanwhile, corporate interest in adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset is continuing to gain steam and filings are picking up pace in recent weeks. While volatility remains elevated, the $110,000 breakout could set the stage for a push toward $115,000 and eventually $120,000 if macro conditions remain favorable, which would put BTC in line with Standard Chartered’s projections for the second quarter. The wider crypto market also showed strength despite trading far from its all-time highs. Ethereum (ETH) was up nearly 6% to $2,660, while Solana (SOL) climbed 4% to $159 as of press time. Meanwhile, BNB and XRP were up 2% and 2.53%, respectively, while Dogecoin (DOGE) and Sui were roughly 6% each over the past day. Despite growing optimism, sharp reversals remain possible in the event of ETF outflows or renewed macro pressure stemming from geopolitical risks. At the time of press 12:06 am UTC on Jun. 10, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 4.18% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $2.19 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $57.45 billion. Learn more about Bitcoin › At the time of press 12:06 am UTC on Jun. 10, 2025, the total crypto market is valued at at $3.44 trillion with a 24-hour volume of $121.15 billion.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT rockets to $70B in 341 days, 5x faster than previous record

IBIT currently holds nearly 20% of all Bitcoin holdings listed, but public companies prepare to acquire more BTC and shake the supply distribution. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) crossed $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) on June 6, being the fastest to reach this mark in just 341 trading days. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported the milestone on X, noting that the fund beat the previous speed record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) by five times. In addition to speed, IBIT’s dominance also shines among other spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, the BlackRock fund commands more than triple the next-largest vehicle, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), with $21.3 billion under management. Furthermore, it dwarfs Ark 21shares’ ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, with their $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion under management, respectively. Grayscale’s legacy GBTC fund remains sizeable at $19.3 billion, but it is still more than three times smaller than IBIT. IBIT holds about 662,707 BTC, nearly 20% of the 3,404,140 BTC which is custodied on behalf of public companies, private companies, governments, exchanges, and DeFi smart contracts. However, IBIT’s dominance among institutional Bitcoin holders might be threatened as interest extends beyond ETFs and suggests distribution over BTC’s supply in the next few years. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, shared data from Wells Fargo on June 9 that six publicly traded firms collectively hold or plan to raise up to $76 billion for potential Bitcoin purchases. The companies include Strategy, Twenty One Capital, Strive, Semler Scientific, Nakamoto Corp., and Trump Media and Technology Group. Sigel highlighted that the pool equals 56% of the spot Bitcoin ETF complex’s current assets under management and 16% of the net ETF inflows accumulated over the past 16 months. IBIT’s rapid ascent to $70 billion cements the spot Bitcoin ETFs as the dominant gateway for institutional exposure, while parallel corporate capital raises point to deeper supply consolidation in the months ahead.

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante Well, the bromance is officially over — Trump and Musk are done playing footsie, and wouldn’t you know it, Elon just showed up rocking a fresh black eye. Welcome to the club, buddy. Jewish Heritage Month wrapped up with a bang — and not the kind you’d expect. We got Trump at the White House, waxing poetic about how Jews built America (or something like that), in between deals with one of Epstein’s most esteemed customers, Mohammed bin Salman, in Riyadh — you know, the place where half the supposed 9/11 hijackers were from… though oddly, many of them are still alive and well. Don’t ask questions. What were they talking about? Oh, just the usual: AI surveillance grids, Palantir wet dreams, and something about the Greater Israhell project turning northern Saudi into a techno-dystopian smart gulag called NEOM. Very cutting edge. If you liked Gaza, you’ll love what they’re cooking up next. And speaking of cutting edge — you better believe those mRNA jabs got fast-tracked harder than a BlackRock ETF. Safety trials? Pfft. Who needs those when Pfizer’s got your back and the media’s already told you it’s safe, effective, and if you don’t take it, you’re probably a domestic terrorist? Oh, and did I mention Trump’s beautiful new bill? This monstrosity says no state or local government can regulate AI or “automated threat detection systems” for the next ten years. That’s right — AI is officially untouchable. The robots can spy, flag, and maybe even “neutralize” — all for your safety, of course — and there’s absolutely nothing your local sheriff can do about it. Meanwhile, Palantir (aka Thiel’s techno-snakepit) is busy testing its kill systems in Gaz-A-Lago, helping cleanse what’s left of the women and children over there. Great practice for what’s coming to a smart city near you. And just when you thought it couldn’t get weirder: Kristi Noem went all the way to the Wailing Wall to cry about antisemitism (and maybe her poll numbers). Not to be outdone, Israel fired warning shots over diplomats’ heads, killed two Zionist Christians in D.C., and had the algorithm fix the news cycle the next day. Nothing to see here. Oh, and apparently South Korea decided now was the perfect time to open its first Holocaust museum. Totally random. Totally normal. Meanwhile, back in the Empire of Debt, Elon Musk ditched DOGE, bailed on the $5,000 freedom checks he teased, and the trillions he was going to “cut” magically vanished — as expected — into the black hole known as the U.S. military-industrial-Israel complex. But hey, he did get a nice shiner for his troubles. And Trump? The guy who once swore he’d pay off the national debt? He’s back with a plan to increase spending by up to $6 trillion. Gotta love that America First fiscal discipline. Anyway, I’m all out of ATODASOs. But you already knew this was coming. Anyway, my world tour is continuing. Catch me at Freedomfest on June 14th in Palm Springs (HERE is my exact speech time and topic). I’m personally very excited to finally meet Ross Ulbricht in person. I told his mother years ago that Ross would not stay in jail for the rest of his life and my prediction came true! If you’d like to join us, you can get 10% off at Freedomfest using the code ANARCHAPULCO. After that, I’ll be speaking at Porcfest in New Hampshire from June 16-22nd. And, in September, I’ll be speaking at Liberpulco in Serbia and Liberland. I don’t think the exact dates and tickets have been put live yet but it should be in the first week of September. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Among mega-cap assets, Ethereum [ETH] stands out as one of the few still holding onto its May gains, currently trading over 3% above its early-May levels. But this resilience isn’t accidental. Instead, it appears to be part of a calculated allocation strategy by BlackRock. You see, over the past ten days alone, the firm has deployed $50 million into ETH. For an institution built on performance, such capital deployment isn’t speculative. Could this, then, be a signal that BlackRock is positioning ahead of a broader market repricing, with Ethereum’s once-distant $3k target now within striking distance? In less than a week, nearly $700 million slipped out of BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] spot treasury (IBIT), with one day alone seeing almost half a billion in outflows. But it’s not just the ETF, BlackRock also liquidated approximately 5,400 BTC, amounting to a substantial $56 billion sell-off on the 30th of May. Consequently, this significant unwind contributed to heightened market volatility, triggering risk-off sentiment that pushed BTC to retrace back to $100k by the 5th of June. Naturally, one would expect Ethereum to mirror this downturn, especially with millions wiped from derivatives. However, ETH demonstrated relative resilience, limiting losses to 6.8% compared to BTC’s double-digit decline. In fact, ETH settled into a tight trading range, indicating reduced volatility and more stable price dynamics relative to Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) As previously mentioned, this resilience isn’t a fluke. Instead, this stability aligns with strategic capital flows. Beyond BlackRock’s direct accumulation, its Ethereum ETF (ETHA) recorded nearly $319 million in inflows over the past week, marking the first sustained weekly inflows since the November 2024 rally. According to AMBCrypto, such consistent demand signals a deliberate strategic allocation. Hence, reinforcing BlackRock’s positioning in Ethereum as a part of a broader, data-driven investment thesis. Given the scale of BlackRock’s investment, it’s a fair question to ask – Does the world’s largest asset manager see something the broader market is missing? Ethereum’s on-chain and market structure data suggest so. Right now, ETH supply on cold wallets is at a 7-year low. At the same time, over 340,000 ETH are sitting in the staking queue, waiting to be locked up for yield. So we’ve got less ETH circulating, and more getting sidelined. Then there’s the derivatives market. In May, ETH open interest exploded past $35 billion, even higher than during the last bull market peak. Source: Coinglass Put it all together, and it looks like BlackRock is betting on a structural supply squeeze. With more ETH being locked for staking, long-term holds, or leveraged futures, the amount available for trading keeps shrinking, and that’s exactly where their thesis might be taking shape. In turn, making the elusive $3k target look a lot closer, and turning Ethereum’s current consolidation into a strong setup for a potential breakout.

CurveBlock leads the charge as the first real estate development firm in the UK Digital Securities Sandbox. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Public PoW blockchain Kadena makes its first capital deployment from a $50 million grants program, backing UK startup CurveBlock in the Bank of England’s Digital Securities Sandbox. Kadena has awarded the first grant from its new $50 million ecosystem fund, allocating $400,000 to CurveBlock, a UK-based startup building tokenized real estate inside a regulated financial sandbox. The milestone marks a pivotal intersection between open blockchain infrastructure and government-led experimentation with digital securities, underscoring growing institutional appetite for compliant pathways into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). CurveBlock is the first real estate firm accepted into the UK’s Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), a joint initiative of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. The DSS allows blockchain-native financial instruments to operate under modified CSD and exchange rules through 2028, enabling the issuance, trading, and settlement of digital securities with relaxed regulatory constraints. Kadena’s grant is the first deployment from its newly expanded $50 million program, half of which ($25M) is explicitly earmarked for RWA tokenization. The initiative is designed to support builders working on tokenized debt, real estate, and other compliant asset rails, with applicants eligible for equity-free funding, infrastructure support, and code review. CurveBlock’s grant reflects growing interest in aligning public blockchain tech with real-world institutional demand. “Our Grants Program and token standards are essential to enabling compliant, scalable tokenization,” said Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena. “We’re doubling down on ecosystem real-world use cases institutions need.” The DSS launched in late 2024 and represents one of the world’s most advanced attempts at legally enabling digital securities experimentation. Participating firms can scale projects through a series of regulatory gates. CurveBlock recently cleared Gate 1 with support from Kadena and will continue testing live real estate tokenization flows over the coming months. Annelise Osborne, Kadena’s Chief Business Officer and former Moody’s executive, believes that a lack of infrastructure, not institutional interest, is the real bottleneck for RWA adoption. “With this $25 million, I really hope we’ll have a lot more builders and a lot more fintechs that come from the tokenization side… I’m a huge believer that they’re going to grow,” she told American Banker. Osborne has also noted the importance of proof-of-work infrastructure, like Kadena’s Chainweb, in delivering scalable and secure tokenization rails. Kadena’s approach differs from many rivals in that it combines parallelized PoW chains with upcoming EVM compatibility and a token standard designed for compliance. The grant program’s broader goal is to accelerate the adoption of this infrastructure for real-world applications, particularly where on-chain permissioning and regulatory controls are critical. The real estate tokenization market alone is projected to grow to $19.4 billion by 2033, with recent months seeing a 260% surge in overall RWA market cap to $23 billion. Institutions including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and BlackRock are actively piloting tokenized securities, suggesting that demand for compliant blockchain rails is no longer hypothetical. Kadena’s grant to CurveBlock is a notable signal that public-chain infrastructure may yet play a central role in that evolution. If successful, the experiment could shape not just the future of tokenized real estate in the UK, but also influence US and EU approaches to sandbox-based digital finance.

Title: BTC, Ether, XRP, Solana, USDT, RLUSD — Social Media is Going Crazy for These 6 Crypto Assets, Here’s Why

The week ended on a promising note for several cryptocurrencies as social sentiments turned positive this Thursday. According to data from the on-chain analytical platform Santiment, market participants are collectively expressing excitement about several crypto assets, notably BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, USDT, and RLUSD. Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin appears to be trending due to an increase in bullish BTC price predictions despite the asset’s drop to $100,000, treasury acquisition by leading companies, and new Spot Bitcoin ETF filings, among other reasons. Notably, President Trump’s Truth Social announced the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, with excerpts of the filing noting that “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust.” Similarly, conversations regarding ETH and the Ethereum blockchain highlight its staking security model and rising institutional interest rates, with key players like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity backing ETH. Right behind ETH, XRP, and SOL are now leading altcoin-based conversations. While cross-border payment discourse and institutional adoption by Ripple partners are making up a huge part of the ongoing discussions for XRP, the recent move by a Chinese-based firm, Webus, to raise $300 million for an XRP treasury plan has become a trending topic. On the other hand, Solana’s high transaction speed and significant Total Value Locked (TVL), the Layer-1 blockchain and its native token SOL have earned it a spot in the conversation pit this week, with traders and investors showing keen interest in SOL. Ripple’s RLUSD and Tether’s USD are stablecoins heating up this week. The RLUSD stablecoin can successfully be embedded into Ripple’s UAE and Dubai-based global payment networks upon regulatory approval. Similarly, the USDT has been mentioned along with several futures platforms, including KuCoin, ByBit, Binance Futures, and OKX, with market participants anticipating mass adoption in the long term.

Title: Binaryx Platform Announces Global Expansion as Real Estate Tokenization Accelerates Toward $16 Trillion Market

June 09, 2025 10:45 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC London, UK, June 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Binaryx, a fractional real estate investing platform, is announcing its move to commercial scale following a successful pilot phase. With $4.4 million in processed investments, with a second-by-second payment of dividends to investors, and 25 tokenized properties launched, Binaryx is contributing to the broader shift toward real estate tokenization — a market projected to unlock $16 trillion in value by 2030. According to a recent statement by Boston Consulting Group, asset tokenization could unlock a $16 trillion market by 2030, with real estate expected to comprise a substantial share of that value. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly endorsed tokenization as “the next generation for markets,” while Citi calls it “the future of assets” in its 2023 Money, Tokens and Games report. But why real estate? And why now? Real Estate: The Ideal On-Ramp to the Token Economy While tokenization has been applied to everything from art and carbon credits to equities and treasuries, real estate stands out as uniquely suited for this transition. Why? Because it checks every box for blockchain-enhanced ownership: Tokenization offers a solution to many of real estate’s pain points — reducing the capital required to participate, opening up cross-border investment flows, and enabling secondary market liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. According to JPMorgan’s 2025 statement on Blockchain’s role in commercial real estate, “Many people avoid real estate because of the upfront capital required. Tokenization, or fractionalizing assets, could open real estate to a broader audience.” Breaking Down the Barriers Traditional real estate investment has long been seen as the domain of high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and institutions. It’s capital-intensive, illiquid, and fragmented by jurisdiction. Enter tokenization — the process of converting ownership of physical assets into digital tokens on the blockchain, which promises to make fractional ownership, cross-border investing, and instant liquidity not only possible but increasingly mainstream. “Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize traditional asset management by offering greater efficiency, transparency, and access,” says Roger Bayston, Executive Vice President at Franklin Templeton. “It’s not just about digitizing securities. It’s about creating an entirely new financial infrastructure.” For real estate specifically, the transformation is overdue. Despite being one of the largest asset classes globally, valued at over $379.7 trillion, according to Savills, real estate remains among the least liquid. Assets can take months or even years to sell, and transaction costs are notoriously high. Tokenization reduces friction by enabling near-instant transfers on digital asset platforms, cutting out intermediaries and reducing settlement times from weeks to minutes. From Concept to Market: Binaryx Bridges the Gap Still, the real-world application of tokenized real estate has remained limited — until now. While many platforms have lingered in the experimental phase, Binaryx, a fractional real estate marketplace, is transitioning from pilot phase to broader market implementation. Founded by a team from Ukraine, the platform aims to simplify access to international real estate by lowering entry thresholds. Through asset-backed tokens, the platform offers exposure to real estate that generates passive income from rent or profit from appreciation, all without the traditional burdens of ownership. “Our goal was to break down the invisible wall between everyday investors and institutional-grade real estate,” says Oleg Kurchenko, founder and CEO of the Binaryx Platform. “By tokenizing real properties across markets like Bali, Turkey, Montenegro, and beyond, we’re opening the door to income-generating assets that were previously out of reach for millions.” Binaryx Platform’s tokenized assets are backed by a legally sound structure: each property is owned by a separate DAO LLC registered in Wyoming, USA, providing full transparency and investor protection under U.S. law. This structure enables direct, traceable ownership for token holders, not just exposure to a fund. On the Binaryx platform, you're not buying into a pooled vehicle like a REIT. Instead, you become a direct co-owner of a specific property through a DAO LLC, with your ownership rights securely recorded on-chain and legally recognized in the U.S. This structure enables a higher degree of transparency and control compared to traditional pooled real estate models such as REITs or crowdfunding platforms. A Growing Global Investor Base with Real Returns Binaryx Platform has seen continued user growth and activity since its launch. As of mid-2025, over 2,000 investors have already joined the platform, building diversified portfolios from properties across Bali, Montenegro, Turkey, and other fast-growing markets. Behind these numbers are real people seeing tangible results. Tomas, an investor from Germany, invested $10,000 in a property in Bali and began receiving monthly income almost immediately. After 11 months, his investment grew by +18.97% in capitalization, earning him $994. Another user, Kat — an IT professional from France — began with $8,200 and earned a return of +17.04% in just one year. “What impressed me most is the transparency and control,” she says. “I choose the property, I track the returns, and I can sell anytime on the secondary market.” These individual experiences reflect a broader trend: an increasing number of people are turning to tokenized real estate as a practical way to grow their wealth. Binaryx continues to attract a global investor base that values transparency, legal clarity, and control. “We’re building a borderless real estate market where trust is earned through transparency,” says CEO Oleg Kurchenko. “That’s why our retention and reinvestment rates are so strong. People invest — and then they come back.” With tangible assets, a legal framework, and recorded transactions, the platform reflects a new approach to digital property ownership. Not Without Risks — But No Longer a Thought Experiment Of course, tokenized real estate isn’t without its challenges. Legal enforceability varies by jurisdiction. Custody standards are still evolving. Secondary markets are thin, for now. But these are not fatal flaws. They’re typical growing pains of any disruptive innovation. As infrastructure, regulation, and investor understanding mature, tokenized real estate is expected to shift from niche curiosity to mainstream portfolio allocation. If the $16 trillion projection holds, tokenization won’t just be the future of real estate — it will reshape how we own, trade, and grow wealth from real-world assets. What’s Next? Looking ahead, the Binaryx platform plans to further enhance the investor experience in the coming quarter. The roadmap includes: These developments aim to make real estate investing through Binaryx even more seamless, transparent, and rewarding for everyday investors. About the Binaryx Platform Binaryx is a real estate tokenization platform that operates under Wyoming’s 2021 law (W.S. SF0038), turning real estate properties into digital tokens. For each property, Binaryx creates a dedicated LLC in Wyoming that issues tokens on the blockchain. When you buy these tokens, you become a co-owner of the LLC that owns the property, with all ownership rights protected by state law.

Title: Cardano’s Biggest Economic Event Ever Is Coming This November: Hoskinson
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-biggest-economic-event-this-november/
Time Published: 2025-06-09T13:00:03Z
Full Content:
In his latest live streamed AMA, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson declared that Midnight—the smart-contract side-chain he has long touted as the network’s privacy and compliance pillar—will ignite what he called “the single biggest economic event in the history of Cardano” and that the decisive launch sequence will culminate by November. “Cardano is going to get the largest distribution of any chain, even though it’s a smaller market-cap than Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin,” Hoskinson said, adding that Midnight’s token-generation event (TGE) and foundation rollout are “turning on this month and next month,” with a coordinated media campaign of videos, infographics and a formal tokenomics paper to follow. “If Midnight is successful, it’s the single biggest economic event in the history of Cardano,” he stressed. Hoskinson framed Midnight as the linchpin of a “triumvirate” that welds Cardano, Bitcoin and the data-protection chain into a single settlement stack. Using Taproot-enabled recursive proofs on Bitcoin for long-term finality—and an operator-based batching layer dubbed Fairgate for near-instant execution—Midnight will allow enterprises ranging from fintech giants to custodians such as BlackRock “to decide whether they want 100% Bitcoin-derived security or faster, cheaper throughput,” he said. To handle high-frequency retail flows, Input Output is folding Hydra and Lightning research into Thundercloud, a hybrid layer-two that Hoskinson believes will “shake the DeFi world” once it’s bundled with Blockfrost’s indexing and a forthcoming Hydra-Lightning amalgam proposed by developer Adam Dean. The full Fairgate–Thundercloud stack, he claimed, will be production-ready in time for the November milestone. Hoskinson’s enthusiasm for Midnight contrasted sharply with his growing frustration over Cardano’s governance gridlock. The ecosystem, he reminded viewers, now owns a 1.7 billion ADA treasury yet lacks an executive arm able to deploy it. “We could convert a hundred million dollars’ worth of ADA into USDM tomorrow,” he said, insisting that seeding liquidity across Cardano’s DeFi markets would earn yield for the treasury while solving the network’s perennial stablecoin shortage. “But people keep asking ‘save us, save us’ while stalling 39 budget votes.” That bottleneck, he argued, is the direct result of a 2022 pivot toward fully decentralized legislation and judiciary functions without restoring any counterpart executive layer. “I’m not working for $200 an hour,” he snapped, warning that Input Output (IO) will increasingly focus on “building on Cardano” rather than subsidising core infrastructure unless incentives change. The AMA also laid bare Hoskinson’s personal fatigue. “I’m tired—been on a ten-year death-march,” he confessed, revealing plans for a six-month sabbatical once Midnight is safely live and the 2026 budget overhaul begins. Nonetheless, he affirmed that IO will keep delivering imminent upgrades: Ouroboros Leios, Babel fees, Lace mobile, StarStream virtual machine integration, and node-diversity initiatives aimed at sharding mempools. Although Hoskinson teased that internal testing could push certain Midnight components live earlier than November, he framed that month as the point at which the foundation, TGE and ecosystem incentives align in public view. By then, the Midnight Foundation will have announced “over a hundred” launch partners—Brave Software being the latest named—and the capacity-token dual-model will begin routing privacy-preserving transactions back to Cardano’s Layer 1. If the rollout succeeds, Hoskinson predicts not just a surge of users and fees but a re-rating of Cardano’s strategic value in sovereign-grade finance and regulated DeFi. “Cardano plus Midnight together plus Bitcoin—we solve all those problems,” he said. Previously, Hoskinsons already revealed that the “Glacier Drop” will be a massive airdrop. It will distribute Midnight tokens (NIGHT and DUST) to approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon). At press time, ADA traded at $0.66. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Climate: Killing Clean Energy Incentives May Boost Power Prices

ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. Current Climate brings you the latest news about the business of sustainability every Monday. Sign up to get it in your inbox. getty Power to the grid from solar, wind and batteries has been the fastest-growing source of new U.S. electricity generation in recent years, but proposed cuts in federal support for clean energy in the budget bill passed by House Republicans threaten to reduce the amount of renewables added by at least 10% over the next decade, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” seeks to end clean energy tax credits for all new sources except nuclear power, unless their construction starts within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and their operations begin before 2029. If passed in its current form, the loss of incentives would likely lead to a short-term rush to buy and build renewable power projects, followed by a steep dropoff late this decade, BNEF said. While 10% fewer renewable energy projects over the next decade may not seem dramatic, the impact is magnified because energy demand is expected to grow dramatically over the same period. “Imagine that your income went down 10% just as a bunch of really expensive bills were coming due. That's kind of what’s happening here,” said Derrick Flakoll, a BNEF senior policy associate. “We know there's a lot of load growth that's coming into the U.S.–more heat and hot days, more air conditioning and everybody is a little bit frantic about data centers,” he said. “We're fairly conservative in our estimates for data center growth and we still see that load doubling by 2030 and that being the biggest driver of power demand growth in the next few years.” In the case of solar, the budget bill eliminates the investment and energy production tax credits that have made it a particularly appealing option for large- and medium-scale utility power projects. Wind is likely to take the biggest hit, particularly with the loss of support for large-scale offshore wind projects. Slower growth for both owing to higher costs absent the incentives will hit individuals in the form of higher utility rates. “Even if some of these still get built, with the somewhat less favorable economics, you're also looking at them being more expensive for ratepayers,” Flakoll said. Something else that may boost electricity prices–if utilities opt to build fossil fuel or nuclear plants, a recent report from Boston University finds that those projects are more likely to be over budget and take longer than planned. Solar projects and wind farms, by contrast, are likely to be finished ahead of schedule and under budget. We’re once again seeking nominations from founders, policymakers, investors, organizers, artists, scientists and others driving meaningful impact in climate and sustainability efforts around the world.

AFP via Getty Images When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Read more here ChargePoint The Trump Administration isn’t supportive of EV incentives and the budget bill eliminates them and funds for charging infrastructure. What does that mean for your business? It's a big stewpot full of headwinds and tailwinds. The current administration's position on clean energy and climate change obviously is a headwind. I think more tactically, the uncertainty around tariffs and the current budget bill and what that means for federal incentives has put a lot of uncertainty in the market, which has people on hold and waiting in some instances to decide how to move forward. Regardless of how that all comes out, I think just some certainty is going to help stabilize things and get people moving forward again. So those are headwinds. I think on the tailwind side, for us at least, we've still got a strong market in Europe without the types of headwinds we're facing here in North America. I'm firmly convinced, as biased as I am, that EVs are just a superior product to gas-powered vehicles: fewer moving parts; way more reliable; very little service required; and a better driving experience. And I think as more and more consumers experience them, the switch is going to happen, in addition to an ever-increasing selection of vehicle types for people to buy. Do higher tariffs also impact your costs for charging equipment? We have manufacturing facilities in a variety of countries, including the U.S. We've got manufacturing operations in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Romania, and the U.S. So we've got the ability to reconfigure supply chains, to mitigate tariffs, but there's definitely production of chargers overseas. And there's also the sourcing of the parts that go into chargers. Like many other hardware products, many of those come from overseas suppliers. So tariffs have an effect based on where they stand today. They're obviously very dynamic and changing regularly. We see an effect, but it's pretty minimal and we believe we can overcome it through cost reductions and other optimizations. But again, that's based on where things stand today. What does your plan to work with Eaton Corp. mean for ChargePoint’s business? Think of chargers sitting in front of the meter. If you're at home, your charger sits in front of your meter. Part of your electric bill at home, if you have a home charger, is the electricity used by your charger. Having the front-of-the-meter stuff that we develop, collaborate and cooperate with the behind-the-meter infrastructure that Eaton provides is where we can really unlock a lot of value through innovation. Making sure that the chargers in front of the meter work seamlessly and efficiently, and that they balance the energy and use the energy optimally that's being made available from the equipment behind the meter. This is really key to the innovation that we're going to develop in collaboration with Eaton and bring to market. They have various products like smart breakers and smart panels, where you now can have the charger collaborate with the rest of the home's energy use and energy management to provide solutions like [vehicle to home] power.

Title: Trump’s Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF

The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com President Trump has put the spotlight on spot bitcoin ETFs. Trump Media and Technology Group officially filed for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, named after Trump’s social media platform, that will directly track the price of bitcoin and trade on the NYSE Arca. It will be managed by Truth.fi, a newly created fintech platform “designed to offer investment products aligned with ‘America First’ economic priorities,” per the filing. The move is a major step toward Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency and financial services industries, opening up the potential for a major alternative to bitcoin ETFs from traditional asset managers — one that has a direct link to the Trump administration. Experts have suggested that the filing could also invite legal challenges because its ties to Trump Media could create conflicts of interest. The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, a subsidiary of a Florida investment firm, Yorkville America, that has worked with Trump Media on “several commercial agreements,” according to the filing: The overlapping agreements are acknowledged in the filing as being potentially harmful to investors. “These existing relationships with [Trump Media] may be viewed by potential investors as affecting the sponsor’s decisions … for example by causing the sponsor to refrain from taking actions that are in the best interests of the trust but that could harm [Trump Media],” per the filing. The Future is Coin: Other cryptocurrency ETFs have also launched or made moves to launch in recent months, taking advantage of an increasingly deregulated industry. BlackRock launched iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January, and Trump debuted his own memecoin, World Liberty Financial, in September 2024, with a focus on stablecoin. Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP spot ETF currently awaits SEC approval and would closely follow XRP Ledger’s blockchain technology. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. More than 40 firms filed amended requests with the SEC since it nudged them to follow Dimensional’s lead, and nine filed initial applications. In the aftermath of the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day,” many investors are looking to buffer ETFs to protect against volatility. In the ever-expanding universe of ETFs, finding new products that stick is more of an art than a science, the CEO of GraniteShares says. The company, which briefly owned the biggest spot bitcoin ETF, wants to invest in another potentially disruptive technology that could even pose a… The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) took in $1.3 billion in inflows this past week. $SUI is backed by investors like Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of $2 billion. Unlike similar mutual fund products at Vanguard, two passive tax-exempt bond ETFs don’t have a high minimum for fees of 9 basis points. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Trojan Stablecoin: What Circle’s NYSE Listing Really Signals (Zurab Ashvil)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28637/trojan-stablecoin-what-circles-nyse-listing-really-signals
Time Published: 2025-06-09T05:57:45Z

When Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange, most headlines celebrated the moment as a victory for crypto adoption. A stablecoin issuer, once niche and volatile by association, had now joined the ranks of America’s oldest financial institutions. But beneath the bell-ringing and ticker symbols lies a deeper story - one that challenges our assumptions about what crypto is becoming, and who will ultimately control the future of digital finance. This was not just a listing. It was a signal. Circle, the issuer of USDC, has long positioned itself as the “compliant” stablecoin: fully reserved, dollar-backed, regulated in the U.S. But its IPO marks something more profound than regulatory approval - it formalizes stablecoins as a new class of monetary infrastructure, not just a DeFi tool. By anchoring itself inside the legacy capital markets, Circle isn’t abandoning decentralization - it’s outflanking the incumbents on their own field. “You’re not seeing the crypto industry surrendering to regulation,” said Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO. “You’re seeing regulators recognizing which parts of crypto are here to stay - and why.” The NYSE, once a symbol of traditional finance, is now hosting the core operating layer of programmable money. That isn’t irony. It’s strategy. To understand the real implications of this move, we have to zoom out. The world is entering a new monetary epoch - one in which digital assets will sit alongside sovereign debt in institutional portfolios, and where transparent, composable financial instruments will become baseline infrastructure for treasuries and funds. Stablecoins are not just payment mechanisms. They are clearing rails, reserve assets, and increasingly, programmable capital. And institutions are waking up to that reality. As BlackRock, PayPal, Visa, and JP Morgan build their own digital currency infrastructure, it’s becoming clear that the future of finance won’t be built in opposition to the system - it will be built by absorbing it. Circle’s IPO was not an endpoint. It was an inflection. Like the Trojan Horse rolled into Troy, Circle entered the gates of the incumbent world not to dismantle it directly, but to transform it from the inside. By becoming a public company, Circle has won trust from banks, payment processors, regulators, and asset managers. But what it offers in return is not another fintech app. It offers programmable dollars - fiat with superpowers. “The real contest is not between crypto and fiat,” said a former BIS advisor. “It’s between programmable value and static money.” With MiCA rolling out in Europe and PayPal’s PYUSD launching in the U.S., the race is now on to establish transparent, regulator-aligned stablecoin ecosystems. Those who can embed trust, programmability, and interoperability into their stablecoins - while still playing nicely with capital markets - will shape the global liquidity layer of tomorrow. For entrepreneurs building in digital finance, this IPO should be read as a directive: Don’t just disrupt - integrate. Don’t just tokenize - institutionalize. The winners in this next cycle will not be loud anarchists or passive builders. They will be architects of the new monetary stack - those who can offer compliant, yield-generating real-world assets to treasuries, DAOs, and sovereign funds looking for stable returns in a programmable world. That’s where the real liquidity will flow. As someone building infrastructure for tokenized real estate and digital asset treasuries, I see Circle’s move not as a compromise - but as confirmation. The world is ready. The rails are forming. And trust is no longer just a legal concept. It’s a codebase. Circle didn’t just go public. They went Trojan.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Michael Saylor Downplays BTC's Quantum Threat
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/08/asia-morning-briefing-michael-saylor-downplays-btcs-quantum-threat
Time Published: 2025-06-08T23:39:28Z
Full Content:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. So surely bitcoin BTC$109,548.82 would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. For anyone concerned about quantum computing hacking Bitcoin, please listen to @saylor calmly and rationally explain why you should sleep soundly at night. pic.twitter.com/X0XzZZl0Cd "It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token," Saylor said on CNBC. "Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system." Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. "Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year," Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is "unprepared" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. Circle (CRCL) recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data. But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X, Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported. According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an "unacceptable risk," though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported. The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Kerbrat said that blockchains could one day be used to help startup founders raise capital in a transparent way that helps them preserve control. However, under current rules in the U.S., 90% of the population wouldn’t be able to participate—because they don’t, for example, make more than $200,000 a year. Typically, as a company goes from a passion project to publicly traded firm, venture capitalists and private equity firms help raise funds along the way. When it comes to listing on a stock exchange, investment banks also play a significant role, underwriting the offering, and as Kerbrat described it, commanding a “huge banking fee.” According to Kerbrat, a founder risks losing control through share dilution, among other factors, as intermediaries extend their services on the company’s path to an eventual IPO. On top of that, venues like the Nasdaq often charge their own exchange fee, he added. “These steps are just middlemen that are taking over the company, and not necessarily creating value for your customer, for your employee base, or anything like that,” he said. “We could bring, with tokenization, a new world to raising funds, where instead of launching a new coin, you could launch a new offering for your startup and raise funds on-chain.” With a regulatory backdrop that’s more supportive of innovation, Kerbrat said that Robinhood is well positioned to help startup founders bypass middlemen, leveraging its “huge retail platform” alongside its connections on the institutional side with market makers. Instead of basing an investor’s accreditation on factors like their salary, Kerbrat argued that “the checkpoint should be education” and whether investors are aware that early-stage investments carry outsized risk. In April, Kerbrat submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission recommending that there should be knowledge-based tests and self-certification components to accreditation. “A new regulatory approach is needed to allow tokenization to flourish, and that system should be designed at a federal level to provide consistency to the marketplace,” the letter stated. Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or real estate, tokenization can refer to any asset that's represented with a token on-chain. Last month, crypto exchange Kraken said that it would begin offering users in Europe the ability to trade U.S.-listed stocks using Solana. Tokenization advocates, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have focused on benefits beyond the potential democratization of markets. When he backed tokenization in 2022, his focus was on greater market efficiency and settlement that’s nearly instantaneous. “I think there are a lot of advantages, but right now, what is blocking us from this world is a lot of [outdated] rules,” Kerbrat said, underscoring that tech isn’t what’s holding tokenization back.

Title: Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one.

Here's How There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid. Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Billionaire BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Will ‘Overwhelm’ America Unless Stellar Economic Growth Achieved

The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager just issued a dire warning, saying that the US will drown in debt unless the country finds a way to stimulate and grow the economy. Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Henry Holterman: Dutch Midas found a 1 billion euro gold opportunity in Greece
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/06/08/henry-holterman-dutch-midas-found-a-1-billion-euro-gold-opportunity-in-greece/

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man. In this invisible but fundamental universe there is no room for misinterpretation or sentimentality. So, by the numbers, the Dutch investor is among the most successful dealmakers of the last few decades in Greece. From the recent deal to sell his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank, profitable transactions in GEK TERNA, Hellaktor and the capital gains from his holdings in Greece, both visible and hidden, are estimated to have so far earned a sum approaching €1 billion. They have been reported to have accumulated over the past few years, and in the meantime, the company has been able to report a total of more than 1 billion euros in assets to date. An impressive performance, but fully justified. Those who have met him speak of an absolutely disciplined investor, with a clear focus and a special ability to identify undervalued assets, making positions without loans and margins. In all cases of his investment moves in our country, those who have interacted with him say that he is a result-oriented person, who is not influenced by his thymic or ego, even in the tough races that have arisen. Just business, aiming for maximum profit. If others win along with it that’s fine, but it’s not an end in itself. The obstacles that appear in his path are an opportunity to rethink strategy and seek alternative moves to ensure a successful exit. No matter how long it takes. His moves reflect what he stands for in terms of investment. In early 2018 and in the midst of the shareholder civil war at Hellaktor, Holterman travelled by private plane to Athens at the invitation of the Kallitsantsis brothers who were seeking support for the proxy war that would shake the historic group, with the aim of overthrowing the then management of the construction group. The talks did not end positively, as did another venture, that of acquiring then Forthnet in partnership with the Odyssey-Athena group, but another opportunity had already arisen that brought him first a 10% and then a 30% stake in GEK Terna. He left the group of Mr George Peristeri after a long time but for an estimated €200 million. Having new firepower, he was placed in the Hellactor group and after more than two years of fierce competition, first with the Kallitsantsis side and later with the triumvirate of Kaymenakis – Bakos – Exarchos, he finally prevailed, having also secured a strong alliance with the Vardinoyannis group. This was followed by the asset sale of the once-mighty Hellactor group, which was done with mathematical sequence precision, and in 2021, when investment grade was still a distant goal for Greece, he invested in Alpha Bank. And while tons of ink had been spilled about how the Dutchman would become… a banker and increase his stake in the bank even further, he correctly interpreted the signs and decided to sell his stake, reaping a profit of more than €340 million. At the same time, he retains a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, which he acquired in the IPO for €21 million, a stake currently valued at approximately €60 million. Holterman could be said to be the epitome of the “Dutch dream”, an expression that is, of course, incongruous because, given the journalistic cliché, such stories happen all the time in America. And yet, its trajectory to date has the characteristics of a story that would easily transfer to cinema. Born in 1955, after his studies, he began working as a chartered accountant. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the largest and oldest Dutch groups active in construction and infrastructure, with Reggeborgh as its investment arm. At that time he meets and marries Herita, one of the two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. And Vessels, after all, started from the bottom. He worked in the carpentry business founded by his father, Arendt, in 1933. In 1968, at the age of 22, he took over management of the company and grew it rapidly, becoming one of the largest construction groups in Europe. In 2017, when Wessels passed away, he held third place on the list of the richest Dutchmen, with an estimated fortune of around €4 billion. Holterman took over the reins of the Vessels family business empire in 2017 after the death of his father-in-law. Reggeborgh, founded in 1990 to manage investments for the Dutch Vessel family, has now developed a portfolio of more than 20 companies in a variety of sectors, ranging from infrastructure and real estate to energy, medical research, and new technologies. The company operates in Europe and the Americas, and its portfolio includes companies such as Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorio, and EVI. In total, the family’s assets are estimated at €15-20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant investment positions, led by a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro Bank. Reggeborgh became the fifth largest shareholder in ABN Amro behind the Dutch state, US-based MFS Investment Management, Norwegian NBIM, and BlackRock. The fund had earlier sold ING its 17.6% stake in Dutch private asset manager Van Lanschot Kempen. Those who know Holterman associate his name with the description “gambler”. In Greek, the designation leaves room for many interpretations, but in the case of the Dutchman it can be said literally, as it captures his appeal for financial investments. However, one of these was destined to cause Holterman problems, which he successfully overcame and reaped significant gains, which would continue to happen in the future. Reggeborgh was among the original investors in the technology company World Online, retaining a significant stake at the time of its listing in 2000. After the IPO, however, its shares suffered a significant drop, causing losses for many investors, but not for Reggeborgh, as it was revealed that it had sold before the collapse. Holterman’s involvement with World Online also had legal ramifications, as the company’s founder, Nina Brink (aka Nina Storms) claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, claiming it was owed to her under an agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was eventually settled out of court, with the Dutchman having said there was no wrongdoing in the company’s listing and that the responsibility for the losses lay with investors’ exaggerated expectations. Under Holterman, the family office made other profitable moves, despite being under the microscope of the supervisory authorities, and in addition to World Online, the family office made significant gains from the fibre-optic companies Reggefiber and Eurofiber, as well as the investment bank NIBC. At the same time, Greece enters his life, and surely even he would not have expected that in our country, he would discover a gold mine of goodwill that added about 1 billion euros to his fortune. About 25 years ago, together with his wife, Herita, they decided to buy a holiday home in Corfu. They acquired a magnificent property in Kassiopi, an area of unique natural beauty in the north of the island where, among others, are the holiday homes of the Rothschild family, German investor Yergk Rockenhizer (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other super-rich. That’s when he met Mr. Nikos Dendia, one of the island’s best-known lawyers at the time, and long before the Corfiot lawyer, originally from Paxos, entered politics and was elected as a member of parliament. The Dendia law firm handled most of the cases of the Dutch businessman, who proved to be extremely active in investing in the country. Holterman’s ties with the Faiacs Island would prove strong in the process. He would buy a dream villa in the Kommeno area, and almost every summer, he would enjoy the beauty and refined gastronomy of Corfu. From there, he gazes at the green and blue of the bay of Gouvia, which is often crossed by the “Guilty”, the famous boat of the Ioannou family, who also maintain a holiday home in the same area. Of course, Holterman knows his way around a yacht himself, having years ago acquired the 47-metre yacht “Lars” built at the well-known Italian shipyard Sanlorenzo. However, a few years ago, he put it up for sale for 24 million euros, and it eventually changed hands for an undisclosed price. Unlike the sea, land seems to be the great love of the now 70-year-old businessman. The properties he has acquired in Corfu, as well as in Athens, are just as unique as the equity investments he has made in the country. One could say that the real estate purchases he has made reflect his investment philosophy. These were properties with excellent location and characteristics, just waiting for someone to bring out their value. A typical example is the historic “Corfu Palace” hotel, which he bought, it was reported, for €30 million from the Fokas family. The hotel started operating in 1962 and is literally in a prime location in the island town, but it has gone from periods of glory to periods of decline, as it required heavy maintenance and renovation, which was done intermittently and never completely. The “Corfu Palace” in the hands of the Dutchman is now being completely renovated, in an investment of 20 million euros, and when it reopens in 2026, it will claim a good slice of the luxury hoteling pie on the cosmopolitan island. Two years ago, it also acquired just two blocks from the “Corfu Palace,” another neoclassical building overlooking Garitsa Bay, totalling 1,000 square metres, at a price of more than 2 million euros. Five years ago, he appeared to have acquired in Corfu and the famous Red House or Antico Rosso, for 8 million euros. It is a property of stunning beauty with a 17th-century mansion built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery. It belonged to the Kourkoumeli-Rodostamos family, one of the oldest on the island, united by the marriage of Nikolaos Rodostamos and Maria, sister of Ioannis Kapodistrias. Those who know him say that from the first moment, he loved Corfu, and he constantly makes sure to prove it. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, the Coast Guard, the Police, supports the Center for the Disabled “Melissa” and the Corfu ambulance, but also non-profit organizations, sports clubs, and federations through Hellaktor. In 2022, he, his wife, and their son were honorary naturalized Greek citizens. The properties he has acquired in Corfu are not the only ones, as he has also made several purchases in Athens. In the capital, real estate insiders say Holterman has built up a substantial property portfolio, part of which was acquired by REDS, which paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., a company managed by the Holterman family. Hestia Luxury Apartments, a subsidiary of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. It also owns other properties, in addition to those in Corfu and those owned by Hellaktor. Real estate, moreover, is one of his favorite investments. In the Netherlands, the couple Henry and Herita reside in an understated luxury residence in Holden, a picturesque town known for its natural beauty and the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park. When it was acquired, it was worth under 1 million, while today it is priced several times that. His penchant for investing in real estate leads many to conclude that his next step after his successful deals in Greece with GEK Terna, Hellactor, and Alpha Bank will be real estate, specifically the creation of a property management company. Hellactor, following the sale of its assets (most recently Aktor Concessions), now has, through REDS, its most important asset, Alimos Marina, although there have been reports that its sale has been discussed, which remains to be seen if it is true. REDS, on the other hand, has agreed to sell to Dimand two of its very important projects, the project at Gournes in Heraklion, Crete, and the Cambas Project at Kantza, Pallini. The company still has several assets in Greece and abroad, with REDS getting into hotels as well, as together with SWOT they have entered into a 25-year lease of the hotel property on Kifissia Avenue (formerly “Civitel”), owned by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which they are renovating, while they are also expected to collaborate on “Corfu Palace”. What is certain is that a few days ago, REDS Hospitality was established by the parent company REDS, owned by Hellaktor, in order to operate in the wider hospitality sector. In addition to the Hestia Luxury Apartments properties and hotels, other moves are being prepared, and it is no coincidence that REDS is participating in the ETAD’s tender for the long-term lease of Vouliagmeni Beach in a joint venture with the Melissanidis family’s Aegean Warehouses. These are the facts, with real estate coming to the fore. Beyond that, Reggeborgh, after selling its stake in Alpha Bank, said it will continue to invest in Greece. However, this is not 2018, when valuations were still low, the economy has taken the investment grade, and the stock market has hit 15-year highs again. What will be Holterman’s next move as a player? Explore related questions

Retail Bob Etchingham Businessman Bob Etchingham, who founded Irish forecourt giant Applegreen, has resigned as a director of artisan food chain The Butler’s Pantry. The resignation has followed reports last year that the business had been sold. Both Bob and Sarah Etchingham resigned as directors from The Butler’s Pantry Holdings last week, a business the Applegreen chairman’s Belgrave Capital had owned. The pair remain as directors of The Butler’s Pantry (Manufacturing) Ltd. In December, accounts released by The Butler’s Pantry Holdings said the company was due to change hands at the end of 2024. Reports linked Natural Bakery owner Luke Creighan with the acquisition, but this was never confirmed. He is now the sole director of The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. “The new owners expect to derive synergies by incorporating The Butler’s Pantry Holdings Limited into their existing business and thereby improve the trading performance of the company,” the accounts read. The accounts said a share purchase agreement for the business was made with a third party on May 10, 2024. Creighan was appointed as a director later that same month. Creighan has built up a reputation in the franchising space, owning some Eurospar stores and Insomnia and Four Star Pizza franchises. He founded The Natural Bakery in 2013 and has since expanded it to 10 locations. The Sunday Independent attempted to email Creighan and a separate employee of The Natural Bakery to ask if he had bought The Butler’s Pantry but did not receive a response. Etchingham declined to comment. Etchingham first joined The Butler’s Pantry as a director in March 2016, building up a stake in the business through a separate investment company, Appletreewick Nominees. In 2019, Appletreewick increased its stake to 75pc in The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. It put €3.6m into the company around the same time as last May’s share purchase agreement. Etchingham made his millions with Applegreen, which was taken private by Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in a deal worth €718.1m back in December 2020. The Butler’s Pantry was set up in 1987 by Eileen Bergin and opened its first outlet on Mount Merrion Avenue in Blackrock. Jacquie Marsh subsequently took it over. The Butler’s Pantry 2023 accounts show a loss of €1.15m. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news
