We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks That are Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC) stands against the other AI stocks. Perplexity, the California-based AI startup that is challenging the dominance of Google in the Internet Search market, is considering the development of a $50 device that brings the conversational search abilities of the platforms it offers on the consumer market. Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of the firm, recently posted on social networking platform X and said the company would definitely sell such a device if the post got more than 5,000 likes. Other AI startups have also tried making AI-only devices, the latest example being Humane and their AI Pin, but these devices have not caught mass attention because of buggy performance. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Perplexity could succeed where others have failed as the firm has much more cash in the bank to hire the right teams for the purpose. News publication The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the startup is planning to raise more than $500 million at an upcoming funding round that would value the firm at more than $8 billion. The report claims that the platform the startup markets currently receives about 15 million queries a day and brings in around $50 million in annualized revenue. Perplexity uses AI to help people search the web in a chatbot-style interface.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC) develops, manufactures, and markets analog and mixed-signal semiconductor and advanced algorithms. On November 26, Craig-Hallum raised the price target on the stock to $70 from $48 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The advisory notes the company reported a beat and strong guide on data center strength, which was primarily driven by Fiber products. The advisory continues to think Semtech's LPO TIA driver product could show strong interest from data centers with expected sales in late calendar 2025. Overall SMTC ranks 14th on our list of the AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of SMTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While private equity firms own 40% of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 49% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significant control over SATS by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders 11% of SATS is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private equity firms make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of SATS, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for SATS Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that SATS does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of SATS, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in SATS. Our data shows that Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is the largest shareholder with 40% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 2.2%. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that SATS Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around S$19m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private equity firms hold a 40% stake in SATS. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SATS better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for SATS that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.

Title: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she doesn’t take lobbyist cash. Records tell a different story

Mountain View By Robert Schmad, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has repeatedly claimed that she won’t accept funds from lobbyists. Campaign finance records, however, show she has received nearly 100 separate donations from registered lobbyists since taking office. Ocasio-Cortez’s account description on X states that the congresswoman is “people-funded” and “takes no lobbyist [cash],” using a money bag emoji in place of the word “cash.” Despite her claim to the contrary, the representative has taken thousands of dollars in contributions from lobbyists since assuming office, according to federal records. The congresswoman has an extensive record decrying the influence of money on politics. In 2018, shortly after winning office for the first time, Ocasio-Cortez criticized her party’s “refusal to reject [corporate] lobbyist money.” Since then, she has called to ban members of Congress from working as lobbyists after leaving office, rebuked fellow Democrats for their close ties to lobbyists, and accused lobbyists of working to kill legislation that would benefit the public. While Ocasio-Cortez has harsh words for lobbyists, she has accepted donations from them every year since she first took office in 2018. Dave Koshgarian, a lobbyist with Ernst & Young, has been Ocasio-Cortez’s most consistent donor, sending her thousands of dollars beginning in 2020. Koshgarian has represented a number of corporate clients, including Duke Energy, MetLife, General Electric, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock, according to lobbying disclosures. Other clients represented by Ocasio-Cortez’s lobbyist donors include , among others, Nike, Delta Air Lines, healthcare trade associations, and the New Venture Fund , one arm of a massive Democratic-aligned dark money network managed by the Arabella Advisors consulting firm. Ocasio-Cortez has also been critical of the presence of dark money, funds that filter into the ideological causes without a clear original donor, in politics. She has argued that dark money groups sway the Supreme Court and unethically influence policy development. Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that she doesn’t take donations from lobbyists isn’t new, as the representative insists on social media that she swore off lobbyist cash from the very beginning. Cortez has, however, dialed down her public criticism of the lobbying industry in recent years, not making a single post on X with the words “lobby,” “lobbyist,” or “lobbying” since September 2022. The Washington Examiner reported in April 2023 that one of TikTok’s top lobbyists sat on the board of directors of a nonprofit group advised by Ocasio-Cortez. The congresswoman vigorously fought against proposed bans on the Chinese social media platform at the time, arguing that the United States shouldn’t ban TikTok but should instead impose blanket protections against data harvesting. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “This is how corporate lobbying works,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in May 2019. “Lobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ ‘sensible’ talking points to mask intent + say policy is ‘misguided,’ then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points.” Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment. Mike Davis, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warned New York Attorney General Letitia James to not pursue any legal action against Trump during his second term, threatening to send her to prison if she does so. “I dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term,” Davis said […] Chaos broke out in a Manhattan courtroom after former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani lashed out at the judge over defamation payments to two Georgia election workers.

Title: NYSE files to list Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum mixed ETP

The ETP uses market cap weighting to give balanced and simplified exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum to investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 Form to list a Bitwise exchange-traded product (ETP) offering direct spot exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), weighted by their market capitalization. According to a Bitwise statement, the proposed Bitcoin-Ether ETP aims at simplifying portfolio allocation for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market’s most established assets. Its market-cap weighting ensures that the fund dynamically adjusts to reflect these assets’ evolving dominance. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated: “Bitcoin and ether aren’t competitors any more than gold and tech stocks are competitors. So when investors ask us which is better to add to their portfolio, often our answer is ‘both.’ This fund aims to make that recommendation easy and actionable, providing balanced exposure to the world’s two largest crypto assets. I think it’s going to be a huge hit with investors.” Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs have collectively amassed $4.2 billion in assets under management. If approved, this dual-asset ETP would be a first-of-its-kind product in the US market, allowing investors simultaneous exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. However, other similar products are also waiting for approval. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently delayed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s Crypto Index ETF, which tracks BTC and ETH, although it is not market cap-weighted. Furthermore, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex filed to launch a similar product in June, as the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF would track BTC and ETH. According to CryptoSlate data, as of Nov. 26, BTC and ETH collectively had a market cap of over $2.1 trillion. Despite their dominance, investors usually perceive the two crypto use cases differently. Investors primarily regard Bitcoin as a digital store of value optimized for security and monetary use cases. Meanwhile, ETH powers the Ethereum blockchain, the largest decentralized ecosystem for applications, boasting nearly $110 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DefiLlama data. Additionally, traditional finance giants like BlackRock, Visa, and Franklin Templeton chose the infrastructure to launch their products.

He sold it to Hotmart, a platform that allows users to sell digital products around the world, in what he describes as a nine-figure exit in 2020. Now Nagpal aims to provide widespread access to something new: easy-to-use, tax-efficient retirement savings plans for the self-employed. In September 2022, he started Carry, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup that offers accounts such as a solo 401(k), a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, brokerage accounts, and a no-fee robo advisor. Small businesses can currently use the accounts in conjunction with the payroll software Gusto or on their own. Carry raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Accomplice VC, based in Boston, in July 2024. Accomplice VC has backed startups such as AngelList, FreshBooks and Patreon. The company is picking up traction. Nagpal says it has about 2,000 paying customers and $60 million in assets under management and is generating over $1 million in annualized revenue. It has attracted most users through online courses, webinars and workshops, with no paid advertising yet. Nagpal projects that Carry will have 3,000 paying customers and approximately $100 million in assets under management by year-end. Carry is among a growing field of fin-tech and wealth-tech companies that promise to simplify investing through a better user experience. The wealth tech space is expected to grow to $18.6 billion by 2031, according to Allied Market Research. Some startups in the space have powerful partners. For instance, Douugh, a “smart banking” account provider based in Sydney Australia,offers investors access to a Bitcoin fund managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. As many entrepreneurs discover when their businesses start generating revenue, their taxes rise as their profits do. That can leave them with little left over to reinvest or save for retirement unless they find good advisors. Nagpal spotted a gap in the marketplace when the accountants and attorneys he hired for Teach:able saved him a significant amount on taxes. For every individual who had the means to invest in this expertise, he concluded, thousands of self-employed business owners did not—and were missing out. “Saving on taxes is important for everyone, but for a lot of people it's just too hard or too intimidating and they don't know where to start," Nagpal said. “I wanted to help business owners unlock tax savings.” One barrier many owners discover is the complexity of setting up their accounts in an industry where legal compliance is paramount. At Carry, he hopes to simplify that process. “A lot of people choose us for the user experience,” he says. “There’s better UI/UX.” Some owners find it too expensive to set their accounts up with traditional 401(k) providers. Setup costs may be as high as $2,000, often with annual administrative fees of $750 to $3,000. There may also be a fee for each participant. Carry, aiming to offer more attractive pricing, charges $299 a year for a basic plan and $499 a year for a plan that lets account holders invest in options including a custom plan, alternative assets like Bitcoin, a self-directed Roth IRA or self-directed Traditional IRA. Carry sets up the accounts but never has access to the funds in them. The entrepreneurs who set up the accounts are appointed the sole trustee and plan administrator. The firm works with Ocho Investment Advisors, an SEC-registered firm, and Drive Wealth LLC, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC, via which securities and cash in the account are protected up to $500,000, of which $250,000 may be in cash. According to Carry, if the startup were to close, users’ 401(k)s would remain in existence, and all funds would remain under the control of the account holder. Account holders could keep their funds with Drive Wealth or transfer the assets to their bank account. Nagpal also runs Vibe Capital, a fund with nearly $100 million in assets under management, which has invested in more than 80 startups globally. Among them are Beacons, a platform for creators to sell their work; Vimcal, a calendar-scheduling app; and Writer, a secure enterprise platform that lets users create AI-first workflows. Accomplice VC, the lead investor in Carry, is an “anchor” limited partner behind Vibe. Matt Brezina, an early-stage technology investor and advisor at Ford Street Ventures in San Francisco, was one of the first investors in Teachable and is now an early investor in Carry. One reason is his belief in Nagpal’s entrepreneurial ability and growth-focused approach. "He's one of the greats, honestly. If I could find eight founders like him per year, my job would be really easy," says Brezina. In Brezina’s view, Carry solves a pressing need in the marketplace in addressing some of the pain of tax planning as a self-employed entrepreneur. “Charlie Munger said whoever you work with, you have one partner in every business deal with you, and that’s the IRS,” says Brezina. “Just thinking about your taxes and tax planning is an intelligent thing to do as a business owner.” Brezina set up his own solo 401(k) on the platform two years ago. He likes that it offers the ability to access asset classes not always available for 401(k)s with larger providers, such as Bitcoin. “Carry has been solving a lot of core problems for me,” he says. “They’ve made it really easy to know how much I can contribute to my Roth and regular 401(k) accounts for solo entrepreneurs. I’m now putting more money toward retirement than ever before because of their platform.” Whether other players start crowding into this specific niche remains to be seen. One barrier to entry is the heavy weight of compliance. As he grows the business, Nagpal is studying for his broker-dealer license. With fin-tech and wealth-tech platforms proliferating, Attorney Andrew Sherman, a partner in Brown Rudnick in Washington, D.C. who advises business owners, says it’s important for entrepreneurs to do their due diligence on any platforms they are considering, especially for a 401(k). "There are so many interesting solutions right now in wealth management and advice," he says. "If you're looking at it to manage your company's 401(k), I would add two or three layers of additional due diligence. You’re now acting as a fiduciary of your employees’ 401(k)s.” While many of the incumbents have the advantage of wide name recognition and decades of experience, Nagpal—tapping his experience as an early player in the online learning platform industry—hopes to offer something many bigger competitors can't: speed. When the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 passed, Carry helped users get a $500 tax credit for each of three tax years by helping them to set up their accounts according to the law's requirements, he points out—while many competitors moved too slowly, he says. “Tax law is always changing and evolving,” he says. “We’ll be the first to react to it so we can pass on as many benefits as possible.” One Community.

A 46-year-old former model who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of a mother of two had consumed 12 alcoholic drinks, which included cocktails, prosecco, wine and gin, in the hours before the crash. Ms Sheila Dunne (50), who was described by her daughter as a “an amazing woman – worth her weight in gold”, died following a single-vehicle crash in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire, Cork, last February. Poignantly, her husband Ted had died of Covid in February 2021. The death of Ms Dunne left their two children without any living parent. The special needs assistant was just 1.5km from her home in Glanmire when the crash occurred. Jennifer Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork, appeared before Cork Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday having pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Ms Dunne on February 11th last. Defence counsel Tom Creed, SC, told Judge Helen Boyle that “unfounded social media rumours” and inaccurate newspaper reports had circulated in the wake of the crash. He said that “malicious rumours” had spread in Cork that the body of Ms Dunne had been moved in the vehicle. Investigating garda Det Gda Mark Durcan confirmed there was no truth to any suggestions that Ms Thomas or any other person had moved the body of Ms Dunne following the crash. Det Gda Durcan said that the crash occurred at 7.30pm on February 11th last at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork. Ms Thomas had been socialising with Ms Dunne, her friend of more than 20 years, from lunchtime that day when they went for a meal at a restaurant in Douglas in the city. They went to a bar in Blackrock in Cork and then on to a bar in Glanmire before getting into Ms Thomas’s jeep. Det Gda Durcan said that in the minutes before the crash occurred Ms Thomas fell asleep behind the wheel twice while stopped at traffic lights. She did two U-turns in a matter of minutes and drove on the wrong side of the road at Hazelwood Road in Glanmire. She knocked down traffic cones as she drove towards Sallybrook and narrowly missed two pedestrians on the footpath. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas took a left-hand bend at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire and failed to straighten up entering a grass verge. The Bluetooth system in the car automatically called the emergency services. Speed was not a factor in the case. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas was wearing her seat belt when the crash occurred. However, Ms Dunne was not. He indicated that the impact of the crash led Ms Dunne, who was in the front-passenger seat, to fall on top of Ms Thomas. Det Gda Durcan said that roof had to be cut off the vehicle in order to extricate the women. He said when gardaí arrived at the scene Ms Thomas was asked who was driving. She said she was and then she “got erratic” and was unable to give a definitive answer. She then said that Ms Dunne was driving as she had “more control”. When she was shown CCTV at a later date by gardaí, Ms Thomas accepted that she was driving. She also said she had no recollection of the crash due to concussion. However, there was no medical evidence of concussion. Ms Dunne died in hospital two days after the crash. Lilley Dunne, a 23-year-old daughter of Sheila Dunne, said in her victim impact statement that she came to court with a “shattered heart” weighed down heavily by the loss of her “rock of a mother”. She said that she was speaking on behalf of herself and her younger brother. Lilley Dunne said that she and her brother head already suffered the “unbearable” loss of their father, Ted, from Covid. “Now to experience the agonising loss of Mom, feels like a cruel twist of fate that I cannot comprehend,” she said. “This experience is what I can only describe as hell. My beautiful mom was taken from us far too soon at the young age of 50. In a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice has altered our lives forever. “We spent two days at my mom’s bedside hoping for a miracle. Out of respect, I made the decision to allow Jennifer to come in to say goodbye to my mom. Knowing what I know now, my decision would have been different.” Ms Dunne said Ms Thomas’s “malicious lies” had trickled out to “vultures” in the media. “Compounding our grief, newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my mom was the driver of the car. Jennifer’s complete fabrication painted a picture of my mom, Sheila, that was far from the truth, sensationalising the tragedy and worsening our family suffering.” Sheila’s mother, Esther O’Brien, said she was “heartbroken” to have lost her daughter to a drunk driver. “This loss has not only shattered my life but has also left two precious grandchildren without their mother,” she said. The court heard that Ms Thomas had 10 previous convictions for road-traffic offences, larceny and misuse of drugs. Defence barrister Tom Creed, SC said witnesses who arrived at the scene of the crash described his client as being distraught at the possibility that Ms Dunne could have died. Mr Creed said that his client has suffered from long-term mental health difficulties and often wishes that she died during the crash. He added that Ms Thomas was hugely remorseful for her actions. Mr Creed said that his client accepted that getting behind the wheel drunk was an “outrageous” thing to do. Judge Boyle reserved her decision in the case. Ms Thomas was remanded in custody pending her sentencing on Thursday. She was warned that she was facing a custodial sentence. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SolarZero insider’s shock: ‘No holiday pay, signs of trouble’ and expert’s doubts about firm’s model

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A SolarZero installation. One customer said it "feels like a liability on the roof now." An insider speaks out; owner BlackRock breaks its silence; the Government’s NZ Green Investment Finance details its exposure; the liquidator reassures customers on contracts; an expert reverse engineers SolarZero’s model and finds it wanting. More details have emerged in the wake of SolarZero’s shock liquidation, which affects 160 employees and has thrown some 15,000 customers into confusion. “All staff were called to a company-wide meeting,” the partner of a SolarZero employee told the Herald. “They were told their pay yesterday would be their last, and that there would be no holiday pay payout.” She said that while her partner and his co-workers were in shock, there had been signs of trouble over the past fortnight. “Staff were told to pause new business, so obviously the higher-ups knew something was wrong ... But even a month ago they were still hiring new people.” The ultimate pay situation would depend on whether the liquidators recovered any funds. Due to “unsustainable operating losses and liquidity constraints”, the business was unable to continue trading in its current form. She said the firm was “losing millions every year”. But it recently secured credit lines of more than $195 million to expand its no-money-up-front solar panel monthly subscription business from 15,000 customers to 100,000 “by the 2030s”. It was not immediately clear why the credit line could not be tapped. It’s understood a staff protest is planned for outside SolarZero’s Auckland office on Friday. The Herald asked liquidator Russell Moore of Grant Thornton to confirm the holiday pay situation, and if he could address how much was owed. “We will be dealing with such matters as is normal in liquidations. We will not be making further comments at this stage,” he replied. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought the 1970s-established business from its Kiwi founders for an undisclosed sum in 2022 and promised to invest up to $100m in expansion. One of the firm’s key lenders is the Government’s NZ Green Investment Finance (NZGIF). A spokeswoman told the Herald, “NZGIF has provided $145m for SolarZero to install solar panels and batteries on homes”. Asked how much of that facility had been drawn down, she said: “NZGIF is working with the senior lenders and the liquidator to assess the situation as it unfolds”. BlackRock responded to the Herald this afternoon but did not specifically address questions about how much money it had put into SolarZero. “A global fund under management by BlackRock Climate Infrastructure business has been the sole shareholder and the largest capital provider to SolarZero. The fund has provided significant additional funding to SolarZero since acquisition in December 2022 and has not taken any capital out during the period it held an interest in SolarZero,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” Customers posting on SolarZero’s Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: “Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?” Another asked: “Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buyback scheme? Feels like a liability on the roof now.” The Herald put those questions to the liquidators. “Verofi is now responsible for servicing customers. They have sent a message to existing customers that their service and contract remains the same,” Moore replied. SolarZero chief executive Matthew Ward posted to LinkedIn: “This has come as a big shock given the recent successful $195m financing with our banking partners, significantly improved commercial performance of the business over the past two years, and the assurances given to me and the leadership team that our shareholder would continue to invest in and support SolarZero to execute our business plan to continue to grow and build a commercially sustainable business. “From a personal perspective, team - please take care of yourselves. This is a shock to everyone. I am going to spend some time with my family who have definitely played second fiddle to work over the past five years or so, before making any decisions about next steps professionally. Kia kaha.” An email sent to SolarZero customers yesterday evening said: “Effective 4pm today November 26, SolarZero Limited (in liquidation) has ceased operations and will not be acquiring new customers. There will be no interruption in your energy service, and the terms of your agreement remain unchanged. “SolarZero has faced financial challenges and, after careful consideration the company’s directors have requested its senior lenders take enforcement action, including appointing Verofi as the standby servicer and placing the company into liquidation.” The liquidator’s first report is expected within five working days. SolarZero has at times been accused of pushy door-to-door sales tactics. Last month, Consumer said: “Our call centre has been running hot with inquiries about SolarZero ... There are certain things that homeowners need to take into consideration that muddy the waters.” The publication warned readers that if they signed with SolarZero, they’d be locked into one power retailer for their electricity needs beyond solar. Consumer told readers to “proceed with caution if you’re looking at taking up SolarZero on its offer”. In August, Consumer reported SolarZero customer Paul Doocey had been refunded $4000 after a longtime fight with SolarZero. Its system was removed from his Māngere home in 2017 after leaks, but he continued to be charged its monthly fees through to 2019. A veteran start-up adviser has voiced his doubts about SolarZero’s model. “SolarZero customers could buy solar panels and a battery set-up outright, which often runs to $20,000-plus or, as most do, pay nothing up-front,” CFO James Allard told the Herald last year. Solar Zero continues to own all the hardware and the customer pays it a set fee a month for “energy as a service”. Rates vary depending on the set-up, particularly the number of solar panels installed, but Allard says a family of four might pay around $177 per month. A 25-year contract term included one free battery replacement. If SolarZero panels don’t cover all of a customer’s needs, they buy electricity in the usual fashion from a power company (SolarZero currently partners with the Genesis-owned Ecotricity). Allard said Solar primarily took its solar panels from China’s JA Solar. Its batteries and inverters are primarily from Panasonic - which has also been a development partner for some of SolarZero’s technology. “A client reverse-engineered the SolarZero model and realised it was never going to work. They could never get a viable model working,” veteran start-up adviser Ralph Shale told the Herald. Shale, a former ANZ Investment Bank associate director of corporate finance before becoming Rocket Lab’s chief financial officer in the last decade, is now a principal at the CFO Centre, which offers services to high-growth companies. “SolarZero is basically a loan book - so I look at it like a financial instrument, like a Government bond with more risk. So if interest rates fall then the value of the asset [Solar Zero] goes up. If interest rates rise then the value falls. “My assumption is if the original investors in SolarZero got their money back it would have only been because rates fell significantly. “BlackRock bought in [in 2022] at the bottom of the interest rate cycle so the capital value since would have been going backwards - and they would have been losing money from operations. “My guess is they have written off the original $100m-plus investment and whatever capital they added in since then. “I understand the returns on residential solar as deployed by Solar Zero ... is around 4% to 5%, so with the cost of funding being now say 6% to 8% they are losing interest margin.”” He added: “Even with rates say down around 2% to 3% they were probably losing money after non-interest costs.” SolarZero chief executive Matt Ward told BusinessDesk: “It’s a real shock for me and the management team”. He said customers would still be looked after, “but our shareholder has decided to stop investing in the business”. BlackRock vehicle GRP III NZ Bidco was the sole shareholder at the time of the liquidation. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

LAST UPDATE | 26 Nov A 46-YEAR-OLD former model who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of a mother of two had consumed 12 alcoholic drinks, which included cocktails, prosecco, wine and gin, in the hours before the crash. Ms Sheila Dunne (50) who was described by her daughter as a “an amazing woman — worth her weight in gold” died following a single vehicle crash in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork last February. Her husband Ted had died of Covid 19 in February of 2021. The death of Ms Dunne left their two children without any living parent. The special educational needs assistant was just 1.5km from her home in Glanmire when the crash that ended her life occurred. Jennifer Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork appeared before Cork Circuit Criminal Court today having pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne on 11 February last. Defence counsel Tom Creed, SC, told Judge Helen Boyle that “unfounded social media rumours” and inaccurate newspaper reports had circulated in the wake of the crash. He said that “malicious rumours” had spread in Cork that the body of Sheila Dunne had been moved in the vehicle. Investigating garda Dt Garda Mark Durcan confirmed that there was no truth to any suggestions that Jennifer Thomas or any other person had moved the body of Sheila Dunne following the crash. Detective Garda Durcan said that the collision occurred at 7.30pm on 11 February last at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork. Ms Thomas had been socialising with Sheila, her friend of over twenty years, from lunchtime that day when they went for a meal at a restaurant in Douglas in the city. They went to a bar in Blackrock in Cork and then on to a bar in Glanmire prior to getting in to Jennifer’s jeep. Dt Garda Durcan said that in the minutes before the crash occurred, Jennifer fell asleep before the wheel twice whilst stopped at traffic lights. On one occasion, a passerby observed that Jennifer was asleep and knocked on the window of the jeep telling her to park up. Instead she did two U turns in a matter of minutes and drove on the wrong side of the road at Hazelwood Road in Glanmire. She knocked down traffic cones as she drove towards Sallybrook and narrowly missed knocking down two pedestrians on the footpath. Dt Garda Durcan said that Ms Thomas took a left-hand bend at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire and failed to straighten up entering a grass verge. The Bluetooth system in the car automatically called the emergency services. Speed was not a factor in the case. Dt Garda Durcan said that Ms Thomas was wearing her seat beat when the collision occurred. However Sheila Dunne was not. He indicated that the impact of the collision led Sheila, who was in the front passenger seat, to fall on top of Jennifer Thomas. Dt Garda Durcan said that roof had to be cut off the vehicle in order to extricate the women. He stated that when gardai arrived at the scene Jennifer Thomas was asked who was driving. She said that she was and then she “got erratic” and was unable to give a definitive answer. She then said that Sheila Dunne was driving as she had “more control.” When she was shown CCTV at a later date by gardai, Ms Thomas accepted that she was driving. She also said she had no recollection of the collision due to concussion. However, there was no medical evidence of concussion. Ms Dunne died in hospital two days after the crash. Lilley Dunne, the 23-year-old daughter of Sheila Dunne, said in her victim impact statement that she came to court with a “shattered heart” weighed down heavily by the loss of her “rock of a mother” Sheila. Lilley delivered her own victim impact statement and said she would forever miss her precious mother whom she described as a “pillar” in the community. She said that she was speaking on behalf of herself and her younger brother. Advertisement “I stand before you today as his voice and to outline the devastation we have both endured. I want to try and express as vividly as I can how this tragic event has destroyed my life, my brother’s world and our family unit as we know it.” Lilley said that she and her brother head already suffered the “unbearable” loss of their father Ted. “Now to experience the agonising loss of Mom, feels like a cruel twist of fate that I cannot comprehend. “On 9 February, 2021 my dad died unexpectedly from Covid. We had to watch him take his last few breaths as they removed his ventilator, and then on 13 February, 2024 I had to watch this all over again: watch my Mom’s heart slow to a halt. “This experience is what I can only describe as hell. My beautiful Mom was taken from us far too soon at the young age of fifty. In a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice has altered our lives forever. “We spent two days at my mom’s bedside hoping for a miracle. Out of respect, I made the decision to allow Jennifer to come in to say goodbye to my Mom. Knowing what I know now my decision would have been different.” Ms Dunne said that Jennifer’s absence of remorse had made the “grieving process so much more challenging.” “It is incredibly painful to know that someone would withhold the truth in such a devastating way and it makes it harder to heal from this loss.” Lilly said that her mother would miss all the special milestones of her life such as her wedding and watching her become a mother.” Ms Dunne insisted that Jennifer’s “malicious lies” trickled out to the “media vultures.” “Compounding our grief. Newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my Mom was the driver of the car. Jennifer’s complete fabrication painted a picture of my Mom, Sheila, that was far from the truth sensationalising the tragedy and worsening our family suffering.” Ms Dunne added that the life of her mother was “robbed” from her. “She has only started to live her life again after Dad’s passing. She will never get the opportunity to finish her bucket list, to see out the drams she had for her future or to watch TJ and I grow up.” Sheila’s mother Esther O’Brien said that she was “heartbroken” to have lost her daughter to a drunk driver. “This loss has not only shattered my life but has also left two precious grandchildren without their mother. My daughter was my biggest support. She was always there for me, providing love, care and companionship. We shared a deep bond, and she was my confidante, my source of strength. “Losing her has taken away my main support system at a time in my life when I need it most. This is something no mother could anticipate. I grapple with anger and sadness — not just for my daughter but also for the reckless choice that led to this loss. It is hard to trust and feel safe in the world when someone’s selfish decision has had such devastating consequences.” The court heard that Ms Thomas had ten previous convictions for road traffic offences, larceny and misuse of drugs. Defence barrister Tom Creed, SC, said that his client’s previous convictions for larceny and misuse of drugs occurred when she was a teenager. He emphasised that witnesses who arrived at the scene of the crash described his client as being distraught at the possibility that Sheila could have died. “(One eye witness) said she (Jennifer) was saying ‘please wake up please wake up’ to Miss Dunne. They tried to calm her. She (Jennifer) was saying ‘How can I live without her?” She was concerned for her friend. She (Jennifer) was hysterical. She was saying ‘look after Sheila.’ She appeared to be confused.” He said that unfortunately following this accident all sorts of “unfounded allegations” circulated in Cork. “One was that a phone call was made for someone to come to scene to move bodies. One was that she (Ms Thomas) was arrested for a charge of perverting course of justice which was never case. She voluntarily came to the station.” Mr Creed said that his client has suffered from long term mental health difficulties and often wishes that she died during the crash. He added that Ms Thomas was hugely remorseful for her actions. Mr Creed said that his client accepted that getting behind the wheel drunk was an “outrageous” thing to do. Judge Boyle offered her sincere condolences to the family of the deceased. She said that the family had painted a “wonderful picture” of Sheila. Judge Boyle reserved her decision in the case. Sentencing will take place on Thursday. Ms Thomas was remanded in custody pending her sentencing on Thursday. She was warned that she was facing a custodial sentence. Meanwhile, other charges faced by Ms Thomas, including one count of drink driving and three counts of dangerous driving, were added to the indictment and are to be taken into consideration when the sentence is handed down. The summary charges consist of allegations that Ms Thomas was under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle at Sarsfield Court, dangerous driving at Hazelwood Road, Sarsfield Court and Sallybrook, and falling to produce her driver’s licence.

Title: Shaping the Future of Fintech: How Knox Networks Aims to Rebuild Financial Infrastructure

In an era when financial technology is evolving faster than ever, a few key players are at the forefront of this transformation. Among them is Knox Networks, a company that aims to reshape how financial institutions manage and move assets. Natalya Thakur, Co-Founder and CEO of Knox Networks, recently shared her insights into the future of fintech during a conversation on #NYSEFloorTalk with Judy Shaw. Thakur spoke with precision and passion about the potential of multi-asset ledgers, the challenges of legacy systems, and the opportunities that lie ahead for financial innovation. Listen to our discussion on the future of Fintech! “What we’re building at Knox is a multi-asset transaction ledger that provides secure movement of all regulated financial assets,” Thakur explained. “Today, when assets and money move, there are a lot of ledgers and rails behind the ecosystem, and it’s highly inefficient. There are just too many systems.” Knox is positioning itself as a solution to that inefficiency by providing a unified ledger service where financial institutions can manage their connections and transactions across both internal and external accounts. Bridging Legacy Systems with Modern Infrastructure Knox Networks aims to bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets, a task that is crucial as the financial world grows increasingly complex. According to Thakur, “Financial institutions today struggle with reconciliation, settlement risk, and fraud, all of which are exacerbated by the lack of real-time monitoring and interoperability across different asset classes.” This becomes even more complex when traditional assets are mixed with emerging digital currencies and digital wallets, which require a new kind of infrastructure to streamline transactions seamlessly. “We really want to be the bridge between these two ecosystems,” Thakur emphasized. The essence of what Knox aims to achieve is providing a consistent, real-time overview of cash and asset positions that helps financial institutions mitigate the challenges posed by outdated, siloed systems. A Unique Background in Finance and Technology Thakur’s journey into fintech innovation is as compelling as Knox’s ambitions. With over a decade of experience in traditional finance and digital assets, she has built her career at the intersection of the two domains, crafting her expertise in the future of money systems. “I’ve spent the last 10 years working at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets,” Thakur noted. Her experience includes work on the capital markets desk at BlackRock and initial blockchain projects at Google. She has also been involved with several global initiatives aimed at standardizing and developing future monetary systems, including co-founding the Stanford Future of Digital Currency Initiative, in partnership with global banks and the United Nations. Thakur is also a member of the Bretton Woods Committee, which consists of financial executives and CEOs committed to preserving an innovative and resilient financial system. Key Milestones and Vision for 2025 Building a reliable, high-performance ledger infrastructure that meets the needs of regulated financial institutions is no easy feat. Knox spent its early years heavily focused on research and development, ensuring the technology it built could meet the high standards required by major financial institutions. “We spent our early years in R&D, trying to build the best multi-asset ledger and piloting with some of the largest global banking institutions,” Thakur explained. Those efforts have earned Knox global recognition, including awards from the G20, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and even the White House. This year, Knox shifted its focus from R&D to commercialization. According to Thakur, “We’re not just deploying our tech for banks; we’re thinking about how it can be applied across exchanges, asset managers, and other types of institutions.” Looking forward to 2025, Knox aims to capitalize on the network effects offered by its technology. “Our goal is to continue building on our partnerships and begin connecting different institutions that are using Knox, creating an interconnected financial ecosystem,” she added. Shaping the Future of FinTech: Partnerships and Applications Knox is particularly interested in partnering with financial institutions that span both traditional and digital assets. The target audience includes teams responsible for settlement and reconciliation, a crucial aspect of financial infrastructure that is often fraught with inefficiencies. Thakur pointed to Stripe’s recent acquisition of Bridge as a signal of where the industry is heading. “Stablecoins are becoming a bigger part of financial institutions’ operations, and Knox can help these institutions plug into their stablecoin ecosystem of choice, while offering a real-time view of all cash, asset, and stablecoin positions,” she said. The broader trend, Thakur explained, is towards a “rebundling” of financial services. In an industry where fragmentation has often been the rule, Knox is working to unify different types of financial operations under a single, powerful system. “A lot of financial institutions are saying they want one system to do more things, instead of having 15 different systems to manage 15 different asset classes,” she said. Advice for FinTech Entrepreneurs When asked for her advice to emerging founders in fintech, Thakur offered a mix of practicality and wisdom. “First off, you need to be obsessed with what you’re building and truly respect the people you’re working with,” she said. “Ideally, you’re working with people who are much smarter than you. It helps maintain level-headedness through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.” Thakur also emphasized the importance of being intentional about customer acquisition. “Who you sell to in the first three months of your business is very different from who you sell to in year five or ten. That first customer is your most important, and they set the tone for everything that follows,” she said. Lastly, Thakur underscored the need for resilience in the face of the unpredictable. “Outcomes in your business are influenced by so many factors beyond your control. If something doesn’t go as planned, just pick up and move on quickly.” A Bold Vision for the Future The work that Knox Networks is undertaking is ambitious, but it’s precisely what the financial sector needs as it grapples with digital transformation and a future increasingly defined by digital assets. Thakur’s vision—one in which traditional financial systems are brought into harmony with the emerging digital asset landscape—is already taking shape, and 2025 promises to be a pivotal year. With plans to leverage network effects and connect financial institutions on an interoperable platform, Knox Networks could very well be the bridge that the fragmented world of finance desperately needs. As the industry moves towards fewer, more integrated systems, Thakur’s company is positioned to play a leading role in ensuring that financial technology not only advances but does so in a way that is secure, transparent, and efficient. “We’re building the infrastructure for the future of finance,” Thakur concluded. “One that’s truly interoperable and capable of adapting to whatever comes next.”

Pantera Capital Management’s Bitcoin Fund just hit a milestone: a 1,000-fold gain in the value of its crypto holdings since launch. Started in 2013 as one of the first investment products exposing customers to crypto, the fund has returned 131,165% after expenses and fees. As noted by founder Dan Morehead on X, the fund saw a huge surge following Donald Trump's election as U.S. president this month. Pantera Bitcoin Fund recently achieved an insane milestone – 1,000x.The post-election surge has taken the fund a further 30% higher. The Fund’s lifetime return is now 131,165%­ – net of fees and expenses.My current outlook on #Bitcoin: https://t.co/0dS8GERNDB pic.twitter.com/plld0BMbef To get started in bitcoin investing, the Bitcoin Fund bought 2% of the world’s bitcoin (BTC) supply when the cryptocurrency's price was around $74. BTC has skyrocketed over 120% in this past year alone, pushing it to a new all-time high just below $100,000. “I think we should buy aggressively now,” Morehead wrote in a letter dated July 5, 2013, that he shared publicly Tuesday. “The price is going WAY UP. It's going to squeeze up like a watermelon seed.” Years later, bitcoin is “still squeezing up like a watermelon seed,” Morehead wrote in a memo on Tuesday. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could reach $740,000 by April 2028, which would translate into a $15 trillion market capitalization, due to the fact that 95% of financial wealth has not yet addressed blockchain, he said. Morehead gave credit to institutional managers like BlackRock and Fidelty, both which launched spot bitcoin and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds earlier this year, for easing access to the industry and allowing exposure to their tens of millions of clients. He also said that blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds will now finally turn into tailwinds with the first pro-blockchain U.S. president taking office in January.

Digital assets-focused investment firm Pantera Capital is celebrating a massive four-figure return on its Bitcoin (BTC) fund, which dates back to 2013. In its latest Blockchain Letter, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead says that the Pantera Bitcoin Fund “recently achieved an insane milestone – 1,000x.” “The post-election surge has taken the fund a further 30% higher. The Fund’s lifetime return is now 131,165%­ – net of fees and expenses.” Morehead also believes Bitcoin is on track to soar to an astronomical value through greater adoption, in part due to the election of pro-crypto Donald Trump as US president. He notes that only about 5% of the world’s wealth currently has taken a position in Bitcoin. “The catalyst for the change – from 5% [of financial wealth] in 2024 to a much higher number – just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States. Massive institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. This new ease of access will finally allow tens of millions of investors and individuals to get exposure to this important new asset class. We believe the broader industry will benefit greatly from the first pro-blockchain US president in office. In our view, blockchain’s success is in the best interest of the nation and we believe everyone in Congress will eventually adopt a neutral or pro-blockchain stance – it’s beginning to happen. Blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds are now turning into tailwinds.” Morehead says the greater adoption may send Bitcoin soaring more than 687% from its current value. “That’s still exactly how I feel. We’re still early. 95% of financial wealth has not addressed blockchain. They are just beginning this massive transformation now. When they do, Bitcoin might be at something like $740,000 per BTC.” In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Morehead says that due to the current level of adoption, he is no longer telling people that Bitcoin has a chance of going to $0. “I used to tell people it could definitely go to zero to try and be conservative. I don’t think it’s possible now. Fifty million people in the US own it, 300 million people globally. BlackRock and Fidelity are selling it. It really has reached escape velocity.” Bitcoin is trading for $93,931 at time of writing, up more than 152% on the year.

File photo. SolarZero directors say the company explored a range of options for a restructure, but were unable to find a viable solution. Photo: lighthunter/123RF Solar power company SolarZero has been put into liquidation, leaving some customers worried about the contracts they have signed with the company. The company - which offers customers solar power systems with no upfront cost but an ongoing, multi-decade lease - said the directors had requested its shareholder appoint a liquidator. It said directors had requested its senior lenders take enforcement action, and appoint another provider Verofi, to ensure power service for customers was not interrupted. "The directors have advised company employees that due to unsustainable operating losses, and liquidity constraints, the business is unable to continue trading in its current form. "As a result, the company has ceased operations from 4pm [Tuesday]. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton have been appointed as the liquidators of SolarZero." SolarZero is owned by GRP III Regional Holdings Ltd, part of the BlackRock Group. It was founded in the 1970s and has 160 employees throughout the country and offices in Auckland, Christchurch and Wanaka. SolarZero directors said the company had explored a range of options for a restructure. "Regretfully, SolarZero and its key stakeholders were unable to find a viable solution to sustain the business. "This is a tough day for SolarZero teams, who have worked hard to build a more sustainable New Zealand. Today's decision is not a reflection on their work or commitment." Customers posting on SolarZero's Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: "Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?" Another asked: "Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buy back scheme.

Title: Pantera sees over 1000x growth in Bitcoin fund, foresees $15T market cap within 10 years

Pantera Capital's Bitcoin fund showcases an 88% compound annual growth rate over 11 years and a transformative shift in financial adoption. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Pantera Capital reported an extraordinary milestone for its Bitcoin Fund, which has grown more than 1,000x since its launch in 2013, according to a report shared with CryptoSlate. The fund’s performance reflects Bitcoin’s (BTC) surging value, now exceeding $90,000 per coin, with a projected long-term trajectory suggesting continued upward momentum. The Pantera Bitcoin Fund launched when Bitcoin was priced at $74, marking the lowest point in over a decade. As of Nov. 24, the fund’s value reached $97,392 per Bitcoin, representing a 1,313x return for early investors. Pantera CEO Dan Morehead emphasized the fund’s remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88% over its 11-year history, illustrating Bitcoin’s unique position as a high-growth asset class. Pantera’s analysis compared Bitcoin’s market capitalization to some of the world’s largest corporations. With a $2 trillion valuation, Bitcoin ranks as the fifth-largest asset globally, surpassing tech giant Meta and automotive leader Tesla. Bitcoin now trails only NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon in market size. According to Morehead: “The global financial ecosystem is at an inflection point.” He attributed Bitcoin’s growth to increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, led by firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity introducing accessible investment vehicles. Pantera highlighted recent developments accelerating Bitcoin’s adoption, including US regulatory advancements and growing institutional interest. According to Morehead, these factors could unlock trillions in additional capital inflows. He said: “Blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds are turning into tailwinds.” Morehead predicted that Bitcoin’s market cap could swell to $15 trillion within the next decade, potentially driving the price to $740,000 per coin. He noted: “The transition from 5% adoption in 2024 to mass-market accessibility is just beginning.” Morehead also reflected on the broader implications of blockchain technology, saying: “We believe every major investment firm will soon have dedicated blockchain teams and permanent allocations. Despite its monumental growth, Bitcoin’s journey has been fraught with volatility. Morehead recalled the skepticism Pantera faced during Bitcoin’s 87% decline in 2013. He said: “It was hard to see the long-term vision back then. But as we’ve seen time and again, these cycles of doubt often precede transformative growth.” Pantera’s early commitment, including its acquisition of 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation, positioned the fund as a pioneer in blockchain investing. Bitcoin’s ascent reflects its growing role in democratizing finance. Morehead likened Bitcoin to gold in 1000 B.C., noting that 95% of global wealth has yet to adopt the asset. He said: “Blockchain represents the first global, borderless payment system. Its potential is orders of magnitude beyond anything we’ve seen in the traditional financial system.” As Bitcoin continues to mature, Pantera remains bullish on its ability to reshape the global economy. Morehead said: “We’re not just betting on Bitcoin. We’re betting on the future of financial inclusion and the promise of blockchain technology.” At the time of press 6:57 pm UTC on Nov. 26, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.59% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Former model who caused mum-of-two’s death in crash after day long drinking session warned she faces jail

Jennifer Thomas (46) pleaded guilty before Cork Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne (54). Jennifer Thomas. Photo: Michael MacSweeney A FORMER model whose dangerous driving caused the death of special needs assistant Sheila Dunne (50) was warned she faces a prison sentence after she drove her jeep following a day-long drink-fuelled social outing. Mother-of-three Jennifer Thomas (46) wept as Cork Circuit Criminal Court heard that she had consumed 12 drinks over the course of one afternoon in Douglas, Blackrock and Glanmire restaurants and pubs including one Prosecco, one Mimosa, two Espresso Martinis, four gin and tonics and four glasses of red wine. Judge Helen Boyle was told by Det Garda Mark Durkan that, during her attempt to drive home, the defendant fell asleep behind the steering wheel twice at traffic lights, narrowly missed a pedestrian, ran over several traffic cones, undertook two U-turns and drove on the wrong side of the road. When questioned after the collision by Gardaí, Ms Thomas said initially that she had been behind the wheel - but then suggested that mother-of-two Sheila Dunne, who was in the front passenger seat of the commercial jeep, may have been driving as she had "more control". Sheila Dunne died in Cork University Hospital (CUH) on February 13, 2024 One witness at the collision scene said Ms Thomas was in a very agitated state and kept repeating: "How can I live without her? Please (Sheila) wake up." Two other motorists were so concerned at the condition of Ms Thomas' driving minutes earlier that they tried in vain to get her to pull over and park her vehicle - while another followed her in a bid to alert gardaí. At one traffic light, she fell asleep behind the wheel while stopped for over eight minutes - with other vehicles having to drive around her jeep. Judge Boyle was told that Ms Thomas made a serious attempt on her life in the months after the death of her friend of over 20 years and believes she will never be forgiven for what happened. A letter of apology was submitted to the court but this was rejected by the Dunne family as being offered too late. Defence counsel Tom Creed SC read the letter to the court. "I deeply regret my behaviour and what happened," she said. "What I did was wrong...I am truly sorry in more ways than I can explain." Ms Thomas also apologised for contacting the Dunne family after the tragedy in "a selfish request for forgiveness." In an emotional victim impact statement, delivered on behalf of Mrs Dunne's children, Lilley and TJ, who were left orphaned by the tragedy, the court was told the two children were left with "shattered hearts" because of the selfish and reckless actions of Ms Thomas. Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork pleaded guilty before Cork Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne (50) on the L2973 road at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire on February 11, 2024. The charge was brought contrary to Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. The model, who appeared in court wearing a black coat and pants suit, sobbed with her head in her hands as the victim impact statements were delivered in person by Lilley Dunne and on behalf of Sheila's mother, Esther O'Brien (74), by Sheila Lee. Lilley told the court that her brother, TJ, has autism and is non-verbal. "I stand before you here today as TJ's voice and to outline the devastation we have both endured," she said. "I have come here with a shattered heart weighed down so heavily by this. "I wanted to try to try and express as vividly as I can how this tragic event has destroyed my life, my brother's world and our family unit as we knew it." She said her mother always referred to TJ as "the best boy in the whole world" - and she is absolutely heartbroken when TJ asks: 'I want Mommy please'." The young woman said she tries to console her brother by saying their mother and father are together "up in the sky." Lilley said her family felt they had endured "a cruel twist of fate" after losing their mother just a few years after losing their father to Covid-19. "My beautiful mother was taken from us far too soon at the young age of 50 in a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice altered our lives forever. "I have known Jennifer for many years. It haunts me that on the day of the car crash I repeatedly tried to contact Jennifer as I couldn't get through to my Mam as her phone was flat. "I felt a huge worry as it was totally out of character for my Mam. "It was later verified to me that Jennifer's phone was not flat and so I could only feel as though I was being ignored. "The betrayal I feel is indescribable and it has broken my sense of safety and trust in everyone." She said her family were told at one point that Sheila was driving the car. "I never believed this and this made an unimaginable tragedy even more painful for me and my family." Lilley said she allowed Ms Thomas to visit her mother at Cork University Hospital (CUH) where she was in a critical condition in the days before her death. "Knowing what I know now, my decision would have been different. "Jennifer's malicious lies trickled out to the media vultures compounding our grief. Newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my Mam was the driver. "Jennifer's complete fabrication painted a picture of my Mam, Sheila, that was far from the truth, sensationalising the tragedy and stripping away her dignity and worsening our family's suffering. "It is heartbreaking to see how easily someone's untruthful words can overshadow all the goodness and integrity my Mam embodied." Lilley said that Ms Thomas' false claims had turned her mother's death "into a spectacle." Ms Thomas offered an apology in court to the Dunne family but they said it was offered far too late to be accepted. "She (Jennifer) asked for forgiveness but never took responsibility for her careless actions. She never said sorry." Lilley said her mother's death has been most painfully felt by her brother, TJ, for whom Sheila was his primary carer. "It is impossible to gauge the extent of the trauma he has endured from this." "Our Mam's death is a hole that no amount of time or apology can ever fill and no justice will bring her back." Sheila's mother, Esther O'Brien (74), said the collision had inflicted "profound emotional scars on all of us." "My granddaughter Lilley was left with no choice but to step up and care for her younger brother, TJ. While I am so proud of Lilley for being such an amazingly strong young girl, it breaks my heart to see the sacrifices she has had to make and the lost opportunities (she had)." Other charges against Ms Thomas, including one count of drunk driving and three counts of dangerous driving, will remain at the district court as they are deemed to be summary charges. The summary charges include that Ms Thomas was under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle at Sarsfield Court, dangerous driving at Hazelwood Road, Sarsfield Court and Sallybrook, not having a driving licence and the related count of failing to produce it. Det Garda Mark Durkan told the court that Jennifer Thomas pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The defendant was driving her two seat commercial jeep with Sheila Dunne as a front seat passenger when the tragedy occurred. Ms Thomas had driven after consuming 12 drinks over the course of a social day out. After a series of near-misses on earlier stretches of road, the two-seat jeep entered a sharp left hand bend near Sarsfield Court but never straightened out, struck the ditch and overturned on the driver's side. Ms Thomas was wearing a seat belt but Sheila Dunne was not. The special needs assistant was then catapulted across onto her friend, suffering serious injuries and later having a cardiac arrest which in turn resulted in a critical brain injury. Sheila Dunne died in Cork University Hospital (CUH) on February 13. The special needs assistant was originally from Limerick and was predeceased by her husband, Ted. Lilley said it was doubly heartbreaking for her and TJ that, having watched their father die from Covid-19 after being on life support in February 2021, they had to watch their mother similarly pass away after being on life support at CUH last February. The fatal collision occurred just 1.2km from the Dunne family home and Lilley said she can no longer travel the route because of the memories of her mother. Mr Creed said that Ms Thomas had made a serious attempt on her life after being wracked by guilt over what happened. "It has had a severe psychological effect on her. She feels extreme guilt over what she has done. Her remorse is genuine," he said. Judge Boyle was told that Ms Thomas has ten previous convictions, seven for Road Traffic Act offences. The judge adjourned sentencing to allow her to consider the various expert reports. "This will attract a custodial sentence so I will remand her in custody to Thursday," Judge Boyle said.

Additionally, BIGZ is trading at 97.09% of its 52-week high, indicating that the trust is near its peak valuation over the past year. InvestingPro Tips highlight that BIGZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders," which corroborates the high yield data and may explain Saba Capital's increased investment. However, another tip notes that the trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins," which investors should consider alongside the attractive dividend. For a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 4 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into BIGZ's financial health and prospects. These additional tips could be particularly valuable for investors looking to understand the full picture behind Saba Capital's investment decision.

Title: Pantera Capital hits 1000x milestone as CEO predicts $740K Bitcoin by 2028

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Pantera Bitcoin Fund, one of the earliest Bitcoin-focused investment funds, has reached an extraordinary milestone with 1,000x returns, representing a lifetime gain of over 131,000%. In a blockchain letter shared on Pantera Capital’s website, Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital’s CEO, reflected on the fund’s success. He projected that Bitcoin could reach $740,000 by 2028, which would equate to a market cap of $15 trillion—an achievable figure within the context of $500 trillion in global financial assets. Morehead highlighted Bitcoin’s trajectory of achieving three orders of magnitude growth so far and suggested another order of magnitude is plausible. He also credited institutional involvement from major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity as pivotal drivers of the next wave of adoption. “Bitcoin is the first global currency since gold and the first borderless payment system ever,” he stated, highlighting its transformative potential. Founded in 2003 as a global macro hedge fund, Pantera Capital pivoted to digital assets in 2013 under Morehead’s leadership, launching the Pantera Bitcoin Fund. In its early years, the fund acquired 2% of the world’s Bitcoin supply, betting on its potential as a highly asymmetric trade. “The day we chose to launch Pantera Bitcoin Fund was literally the low print of the last eleven years,” Morehead reflected. In the blockchain letter, Morehead detailed the fund’s journey through emails and memos, offering insights into his evolving thoughts on Bitcoin at various stages of its growth. He compared early Bitcoin investments to buying gold in 1000 BC, underscoring its transformative role in global finance. Beyond its Bitcoin fund, Pantera Capital has driven blockchain innovation through strategic investments. It backed Coinbase, which reached an $85 billion valuation during its 2021 public listing, Alchemy, a leading blockchain development platform, and Bitso, a top Latin American cryptocurrency exchange.

Title: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $93,000: Top 3 Reasons
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-crashes-below-93000-top-3-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T12:00:22Z

The crypto market faced a significant setback today as the Bitcoin price dropped below the $93,000 threshold. After reaching an all-time high of $99,588 on Binance last Friday, the leading cryptocurrency has fallen over 6%, hitting a low of $92,326. In the past 24 hours alone, the Bitcoin price has decreased by 3.6%. Analysts attribute this decline to three main factors: As Bitcoin neared the critical $100,000 resistance level, many long-term holders began taking profits, leading to increased selling pressure. James “Checkmate” Check, former chief on-chain analyst at Glassnode, noted that long-term holders have distributed $60 billion worth of Bitcoin supply in the last 30 days. “Bitcoin Long-Term Holders have distributed $60B worth of supply in the last 30-days. Out of all the LTH supply moved since the FTX bottom, 21% of it has happened in November. This is the heaviest profit taking we have seen so far this cycle,” Check writes via X. He also points out that selling pressure is not coming from “OG’s” but holders who bought at the previous peak of $68,000 have sold 198,000 BTC in November alone. This suggests that investors who endured the last major correction are now capitalizing on the recent price surge as Bitcoin approached uncharted price territory. The futures market has seen substantial liquidations, amplifying the Bitcoin price crash. Data from Coinglass indicates that in the past 24 hours, total liquidations amounted to $577.39 million, with long positions accounting for $468.98 million. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the situation: “Bitcoin has slipped below $93k since our last commentary, with over $430 million in long liquidations.” They observed that this decline coincided with spot ETFs ending their five-day streak of net inflows, recording a $438 million outflow on Monday, while MicroStrategy’s stock dropped another 4.4%. QCP Capital also mentions that “the pullback follows MicroStrategy’s record $5.4 billion BTC purchase last week.” With US holidays approaching and no immediate catalysts to drive prices higher, they noted that Bitcoin’s path to the symbolic $100,000 level has stalled. The firm also notes a shift in market sentiment: “ETH implied volatility has shifted sharply toward puts over calls, reflecting similar sentiment in BTC as the market takes a breather. Growing concerns about downside risks may intensify, particularly with tonight’s FOMC minutes and Wednesday’s PCE data on the horizon.” Despite the downturn, they provide a balanced perspective: “To put things into perspective, this isn’t an excessive pullback. Bitcoin is merely retracing to levels seen early last week. The market had become extremely overbought since the election with excessive leverage, making a pause inevitable.” The Coinbase premium gap, a key indicator of US institutional demand, has vanished. During Bitcoin’s ascent toward $100,000, the premium gap on Coinbase was notably high, reaching +$224 on November 22. This was driven by strong inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs and significant purchases by MicroStrategy, which acquired 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion over the weekend. However, this scenario shifted dramatically yesterday. On-chain analyst Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) points out today: “MicroStrategy Single-handedly Held Up the Market. The Coinbase Premium Gap, which was driven by Saylor’s buying spree, vanished, and the market started to tank.” Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investment, highlights the immense sell wall around the $100,000 level. He remarked that despite MicroStrategy’s massive $5.5 billion purchase, they “only dented the world’s biggest ask wall by ~25%.” This underscores the significant selling interest at the $100,000 level, which has proven to be a formidable barrier. The diminishing premium on Coinbase also reflects reduced buying pressure from US markets, a factor also evident in the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Yesterday, spot ETF flows were negative by $435.3 million. While BlackRock saw inflows of $267.8 million, other major ETFs experienced significant outflows: Bitwise lost $280.7 million, Grayscale BTC Trust (GBTC) saw $158.2 million in outflows, Fidelity faced redemptions of $134.7 million, and ARK Invest shed $110.9 million.

Market fluctuations see Grayscale, Ark, Bitwise leading Bitcoin fund outflows Bitcoin ETFs experienced a $435 million outflow on Nov. 25, ending a $3.3 billion inflow streak.

Title: Solar power company SolarZero Limited placed into liquidation

SolarZero, which said in August it had about 15,000 customers, has been placed into liquidation. Photo / File Kiwi-founded solar and battery firm SolarZero has been placed into liquidation. In August it reported it had around 15,000 customers, representing about a 40% market share. The company’s directors advised its more than 160 employees that due to “unsustainable operating losses and liquidity constraints”, the business was unable to continue trading in its current form. LATEST: SolarZero insider’s shock: ‘No holiday pay, signs of trouble’ and expert’s doubts about firm’s model “As a result, the company has ceased operations from 4pm today [Tuesday],” the company said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Customers posting on SolarZero’s Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: “Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?” Another asked: “Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buyback scheme? Feels like a liability on the roof now.” The Herald has put questions to the liquidators - Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton. SolarZero said its directors had requested its senior leaders “take enforcement action” and appoint the standby servicer, Verofi, as the replacement servicer and that its shareholder appoint a liquidator. The company said its customers will not be affected by Tuesday’s announcement. In August, the Herald reported SolarZero, which was sold to US private equity giant BlackRock, said it had “pioneered a new financing model” to expand its debt funding to $195 million. Its chief financial officer James Allard said French bank Societe Generale provided $130m of the $195m, and Crown-backed NZ Green Investment Fund (NZGIF), a ‘green investment bank’ that lends money to environmentally-friendly firms, provided the balance under its Solar Finance programme. The NZGIF told the Herald it had been informed of the voluntary liquidation on Tuesday. “NZGIF provided lending to enable the installation of solar panels and battery systems by SolarZero,” a spokesperson said. “NZGIF is working with other lenders and the liquidator to understand the situation as it unfolds. “NZGIF acknowledges the hard work and dedication of the SolarZero team, having worked with it for several years as a lender. NZGIF does not have any further comment to make at this stage.” Customers of SolarZero could buy solar panels and a battery set-up outright, which often runs to $20,000-plus or, as most did, pay nothing up-front. The company continued to own all the hardware and the customer paid a set fee per month for “energy as a service”. Rates varied depending on the set-up, especially the number of solar panels installed. SolarZero’s statement said it emerged as New Zealand’s leading solar company, revolutionising renewable energy solutions for Kiwis after it was founded in the 1970s. “The company pioneered New Zealand’s first solar subscription service, making clean energy more accessible and affordable for households nationwide. “The company developed and operated Australasia’s largest virtual power plant, a critical innovation in advancing the region’s journey toward net-zero emissions.” “This difficult decision follows work to explore a range of options to restructure the company. “Regretfully, SolarZero and its key stakeholders were unable to find a viable solution to sustain the business,” the directors of SolarZero said. “This is a tough day for SolarZero teams, who have worked hard to build a more sustainable New Zealand. Today’s decision is not a reflection on their work or commitment. SolarZero would not provide further comment since liquidators have now been appointed. The company had key office sites in Auckland, Christchurch and Wānaka. -Additional reporting by RNZ.

Title: Trump expected to choose Kelly Loeffler as his agriculture secretary even though she was caught INSIDER TRADING during COVID

The latest expected pick is Kelly Loeffler, who Trump is reportedly about to pick for secretary of agriculture. Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, reportedly sold $20 million in stock just days before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) "pandemic" was declared. Back then, Loeffler was appointed to her seat "against President Trump's wishes," NPR reported. Now, Trump apparently wants Loeffler to occupy a top position in his cabinet. Trump and his allies pushed for Rep. Doug Collins to take what would have been a vacant seat, but that seat was ultimately filled by Gov. Brian Kemp with Loeffler. "She dumped millions in stock in companies to be affected by Covid after a classified briefing on the virus before a pandemic was declared," tweeted Whitney Webb (@_whitneywebb) about Loeffler's insider trading scandal during COVID. (Related: Did you know that just one day before Thomas Matthew Crooks reportedly tried to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump back in the summer a private equity firm out of Austin called Austin Private Wealth reported massive short bets on $DJT and $RUM stocks, which is similar to what happened right before 9/11?) Loeffler's husband co-owns crypto platform that Trump media wants to buy Loeffler's husband Jeffrey Sprecher is also part of a newfound effort to privatize natural resources like air and water through so-called "natural asset corporations." Sprecher, who chairs the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), joined the Rockefeller-backed IEG to implement natural asset corporations that are designed to securitize nature, "particularly parts of the natural world that have up to this point been considered part of the 'global commons' including clean air and water," Webb notes. "It can be used for predatory land grabs, especially troubling for a prospective head of the USDA." Webb further warns that Sprecher partially owns Bakkt, a cryptocurrency firm that Trump's media company just so happens to want to purchase. Once Trump is in office and Loeffler is head of the USDA, it appears as though the next step is for Trump to grease a deal with Sprecher that will benefit the two's private endeavors. A former board member of Trump's media company, by the way, is right now working to turn the precious Amazon rainforest into the world's first "internet of forests." The goal will be to monetize collected data while surveilling and ultimately ending the sovereignty of locals who live there. The same former Trump media company board member wants to tokenize each hectare of the Amazon rainforest with the help of a former top executive at BlackRock "who essentially invented ETFs," according to Webb. "Wall Street is trying to turn all of nature into tradable financial products and it seems like the next admin is down for that (esp. incoming head of Commerce Howard Lutnick!)," Webb warns. Natural asset companies, in case you did not know, are the epitome of climate change nonsense. They involve things like carbon credits, carbon capture, net zero, and more. "Most of the people around Trump's circle are Wall Street investors and they will get even richer in the next four years," warned someone on X / Twitter about the Trump grift. "They give the impression they will cut waste but will instead cut programs which will hurt working Americans." "I feel nauseous," wrote another who feels duped by Trump.

Title: Even a dodgy Firework couldn’t mar day to remember for Gus McCarthy

As debuts go, not least for a 21-year-old hooker, it wasn’t too bad. A try, three try assists, playing the full 80 minutes, the last six of them in the back row, and Ireland winning 52-17 at home in front of extended family and friends. Not even in his wildest dreams could Gus McCarthy have concocted all of that. In a highly impressive, mobile and skilful display made, they are memories that McCarthy admitted he’ll cherish for the rest of his life. There are other too, not least hearing and singing the anthems. As that dream became a reality, as he thought of the route to this point, and those who helped him along the way, the tears streamed down his face. “I was pretty emotional, just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself, but more thinking of my family and the journey to get to there.” It’s funny how McCarthy and Sam Prendergast, the two 21-year-olds, took such contrasting routes to last Saturday’s landmark day for them both. McCarthy was captain, and Prendergast the undoubted star turn, in the Ireland under-20s side that won a Grand Slam and reached the Under-20 World Cup two seasons ago. Prendergast was fast-tracked into Leinster’s first team squad, making his first two starts later that season in South Africa, and his 16 appearances last season, amounting to 473 minutes, led to him being included in Ireland’s squad for the two-Test series in South Africa. By contrast, McCarthy played only 25 minutes for Leinster that season, in their April trek to South Africa, but all changed when Dan Sheehan suffered his ACL injury in the first Test before Rónan Kelleher, Lee Barron and John McKee were all struck down this season. In addition to four starts for Leinster and two for Emerging Ireland, McCarthy was hauled back from that tour to play the second half of the marquee Croke Park fixture. “I probably still haven’t taken in how lucky I have been to get some chances but I’m sure over the next few months I will reflect on that.” McCarthy reckons he played about half a dozen AIL 1A games with UCD last season, and while agreeing that it is a huge jump to Test rugby, he stressed: “But, no, I wouldn’t talk down AIL. There are some physical men. I’m trying to think of my last one. It potentially could have been Ballynahinch away or something like that, which is not a glamour fixture. We actually got pumped.” McCarthy started this season in the Leinster academy and so was, effectively, their fifth-choice hooker. “As well as Dan and Rónan there’s two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot. With the five of us it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads in the last few years. “So, I’ve just said to myself or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, any opportunity I get I have to try to take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try to put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.” In the long term, it’s difficult to see how they can all remain with the province, but that’s another day’s discussion. Even after his unexpected flurry of game time with Leinster, McCarthy was only named as one of five “training panellists” in addition to the 35-man squad for this Series, behind three other hookers, so when he was named to start against Fiji he was as surprised as anybody. “When Faz [Andy Farrell] named the team on Monday I was incredibly surprised. I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. So then when I got the call that I was coming in to camp I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match day. Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous.” His week had featured other highs, not least being presented with his jersey by a fellow former Blackrock College player and captain. “Caelan [Doris] actually gave me the jersey in the Shelbourne on Thursday night, which was very special: a fellow Blackrock man and to have the captain of your country present you with your jersey is very special.” To complete his day, after the game McCarthy saw his parents, Robert and Australian-born mum Tara, sisters Naoise and Millie and brother Hubie, as well as cousins and uncles. There was only one blemish. McCarthy was speaking to a small group of journalists in a passageway near the dressingrooms after Saturday’s game, where he was about to return and ready himself for something more daunting than starting his first Test match. That was to be his debut song in front of the squad. He revealed: “I’ll give a terrible rendition of Firework by Katie Perry.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:30:17Z

Hong Kong’s largest digital bank, ZA Bank, has announced the launch of a retail cryptocurrency trading service. According to the press release, the service enables users to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the ZA Bank app, “simplifying” the trading process by eliminating the need for third-party platforms. This move makes ZA Bank the first bank in Asia to offer such services to retail customers, reflecting the region’s growing interest in digital asset adoption. The trading platform is designed to support transactions in Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and US dollars (USD), allowing users to trade leading cryptocurrencies. To deliver this functionality, ZA Bank has partnered with HashKey Exchange, one of the three licensed digital currency exchanges in Hong Kong. The release revealed that HashKey’s institutional-grade platform, HashKey Pro, provides API trading, block trade services, and “enhanced” account management features, ensuring “secure and efficient trading” for users. Calvin Ng, Alternate Chief Executive of ZA Bank, noted: The rise of cryptocurrency presents investors with more diverse asset allocation opportunities. As a bank, we prioritise security and compliance, which is why we’ve partnered with HashKey, a global-leading licensed virtual asset exchange, to meet regulatory standards and deliver bank-grade security in virtual assets trading – our key competitive advantage in the Asian market. HashKey Exchange plays a crucial role in ZA Bank’s foray into the crypto sector. ZA Bank revealed in the press release that the collaboration leverages HashKey Pro’s infrastructure to “seamlessly” integrate digital currency trading into the ZA Bank app. HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng emphasized the broader implications of this partnership, stating that the initiative aims to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong. We are privileged to partner with ZA Bank in advancing innovation in digital banking services across Asia. As Hong Kong’s largest licensed virtual asset exchange, HashKey Exchange is dedicated to providing users with fully compliant and secure digital asset trading solutions. ZA Bank, as the first bank in Asia to offer such service, has demonstrated its strong leadership and a pioneering spirit in fintech integration. Weng noted that as one of the three licensed exchanges in the region, alongside OSL and HKVAX, HashKey is positioned to support the digital asset industry’s compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, it is worth noting that this collaboration highlights Hong Kong’s efforts to establish itself as a leading hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. In addition, collaboration and adoption have come when the cryptocurrency market has consistently seen recognition from major institutions and even countries. Recently, BlackRock launched options trading on its crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) product.

Title: ‘Any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it’ – Gus McCarthy knows what he must do with Ireland pecking order

Ireland's Gus McCarthy during the Autumn Nations Series match against Fiji. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile It’s hard to remember a better debut or a faster rise than Gus McCarthy’s. At the start of this season, the 21-year-old hooker had made a solitary bench appearance for Leinster on their tour of South Africa, and were it not for injury, he’d have likely lined out for their ‘A’ side against Munster on Friday night. Instead, he has propelled himself into Andy Farrell’s Ireland thoughts after making the most of others’ misfortune. That, in essence, is the game. He came into this season as Leinster’s fifth-choice hooker, but injuries to the other four opened the door in pre-season. He impressed and earned the No 2 jersey for the season opener, making such an impact that he was called up to the Emerging Ireland tour and then called home early to start at Croke Park against Munster. Still in the Academy, he earned a spot in Ireland’s squad as a ‘training panellist’ and was ready to go back to Leinster last Sunday, until he got a tap on the shoulder. He teared up when singing the anthem and his first lineout went astray, but when the whistle blew he was the picture of calm. He threw his first assist for Caelan Doris’s opening try, followed it up with a pre-assist a few minutes later and then offloaded out of the tackle for Craig Casey’s score. After half-time, he got over for a try of his own and set up Bundee Aki for his score. Aki got man of the match, but the hooker was hard done by. He may have been nervous, but the 2023 Ireland U-20s captain delivered an excellent performance – one that is rooted in his days playing minis rugby at Old Belvedere and his school days at Blackrock College. “Growing up, I’ve always played with the rugby ball in hand, always messing around with mates, whether it be at school or in the garden or at home,” he reflected. “I’d just see where the space is, and kind of scan up. “That is something I have to keep working on. Faz (Andy Farrell) is massive on scanning early, so that is something I have to keep working on. I was kind of happy. There’s a few chances that I saw an opportunity to give it early.” McCarthy wasn’t expecting to make the step up so soon. “When Faz named the team on Monday, I was incredibly surprised,” he said. “I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. “I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match-day experience. “Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting, I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous. “I was pretty emotional [during the anthems] just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. “I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself but more thinking of my family and the journey to get there. It was just a proud moment for me and my family.” Already, there is a rush to get McCarthy out of Leinster where Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher are established options. Kelleher is likely to start against Australia and Sheehan is back after Christmas, while Lee Barron and John McKee will have a chance to impress in McCarthy’s absence against Ulster this week. He knows he’s in a battle for game-time, but you sense he’ll back himself to get into that match-day 23. “As well as Dan and Ronan, there are two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot,” he said. “With the five of us, it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads. “So, I’ve just said to myself, or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, that any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try and put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.”

Title: No Fianna Fáil 2011-type disaster for Sinn Féin but repeat of their 2020 success looks unlikely

During the local and European elections earlier this year, Sinn Féin canvassers in some of its heartlands area in Dublin were confronted with hostility on doorsteps. The flashpoint was immigration. Tents erected by asylum seekers were lined along the canal. Around the State, there were stand-offs with local residents over proposed accommodation centres. In Dublin, Sinn Féin was facing headwinds in some of its strongest areas, such as west Finglas, Coolock, Ballyfermot and the north inner city. At some doorsteps, the party’s candidates were called “traitors” and “unpatriotic”. In Coolock, a party member was attacked, sustaining a broken nose. Sinn Féin had a poor election. But then, it also had poor local and European elections in 2019 but bounced back spectacularly in the general election seven months later. This time, though, the journey back seemed more perilous. When supporters turn against a party it is never a pretty sight. For a while, it seemed this general election for Sinn Féin might be a minor version of what happened to Fianna Fáil in 2011 after the farcical collapse of its government. Back then, Fianna Fáil candidates faced similar anger from voters. Outgoing TD Mary Hanafin was standing at a school gate in Blackrock as one young parent guided her young child through the gates. “Hi, I am looking for your support,” said Hanafin pleasantly. “Fianna Fáil?” the woman asked. Before Hanafin could reply, she snarled: “I would rather stick pins in my eyes. You are a load of gangsters.” That was then, this is now. Following candidates from different parties across five Dublin constituencies this time, it’s clear it’s not going to be a 2011 for Sinn Féin. Soon after this summer’s elections, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald visited many key Dublin heartlands spoke to community leaders, in order to lance the boil. The party also did a volte face on its immigration policies. Since then, too, the issue has become less fraught and emotional. Two Sinn Féin TDs, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are canvassing in Moorfield, a settled and attractive estate in north Clondalkin, where it usually pulls in 50 per cent of the vote. Ó Broin is an impressive operator on the ground. In another life, he would have made a great GP, with a mix of empathy and infinite patience for everybody he meets. “We would have estimated during the [summer election] about 10 per cent talked about migration and the accommodation issues,” he says. “A lot of those conversations were decent. People wanted to know what’s going on and were expressing concerns. There was a portion of exchanges which were hostile.” He said the issue is still being raised but not as often. “It’s perhaps the second or third issue. It does not have the same salience. At the time, it was soon after the riots and there were tents along the canal.” The cost of living, housing, tax and access to healthcare are also big issues. A young woman says her partner earns €50,000 and wants to know if there will be a change in tax bands as he feels the impact of cost-of-living hikes. Ó Broin explains the Sinn Féin plan to scrap the Universal Social Charge for anybody earning under €45,000. There is not enormous engagement. There are some pledged votes, some are non-committal. “We are still thinking,” one woman tells the Sinn Féin canvassers. “We really need a change,” Ó Broin urges her. “We are the only party that can do it.” There is only one hard “No”, an immediate door slam. In another house, a relatively young woman says she can’t vote for Sinn Féin because of “legacy issues”. Canvassing in Dún Laoghaire, the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth says that at this juncture in the campaign four years ago, the pension age issue championed by Sinn Féin had really taken hold and that people on doorsteps in all areas were talking about “change” and “Mary Lou”. “We are not hearing it this time,” he says. There is no doubt in Dublin the Greens are feeling the negative effects of being the small party in Government. On the other hand, there has been a defanging of voter toxicity around Labour and Fianna Fáil. In Tallaght, Fianna Fáil’s Teresa Costello is campaigning on the basis of her working-class roots and her understanding of the community. A cancer survivor and advocate, Costello is chatty and pleasant and gets positive engagement. She gets a few commitments of support but it’s striking how many people on the doorsteps have yet to commit. The bicycle shed invariably crops up. “For the name of Holy God, somebody get hold of the Office of Public Works and, for feck’s sake, tell them to stop spending money like it’s going out of fashion. There doesn’t seem to be any accountability,” a woman in Kingswood tells Costello. “The other thing is the national children’s hospital. Nobody called a halt to that.” One man tells her that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in power for too long. “It’s time to give Sinn Féin a twist,” he says. In Beaumont, Paul McAuliffe of Fianna Fáil chats to a manwhose daughter has just graduated as a teacher but who, owing to cost-of-living issues and the cost of houses, will find it hard to stay in Dublin. “Her friends in the [teaching] class are thinking of going to Australia. It’s all to do with the cost of living,” he says. McAuliffe points to the nearby new residential development of 800 homes on Oscar Traynor Road, saying the three-bedroom units will be available to some families at €360,000. The Labour candidate in Dublin South-West Ciarán Ahern is canvassing in Kimmage along with party leader Ivana Bacik. A couple in their 60s say they are worried about “so many people looking for social housing and being on the dole”. The man says: “I wasn’t handed a house. My kids weren’t handed their houses. When I hear people saying it’s a basic human right to have a house, and the Government should be building more houses for people, and it should be beside the mammy. I don’t agree with that.” Immigration is mentioned, but more sporadically than in the summer. “We have loads of immigrants coming in, and they lose their passports between getting off the plane and arriving. I think that they should be sent back to wherever they came from,” the man in Kimmage tells Ahern and Bacik. He says he has no trouble with people arriving who are willing to work in Ireland. They tell him Labour is the party of work and have proposals to ensure that all immigrants, including asylum seekers, can be allowed to work. But no one issue is yet dominating, as housing did in 2020. Nor does there seem to be any huge momentum behind any party. Perhaps we are looking at a scenario like the 2007 general election campaign, where after a fortnight of shadow boxing, everything was decided in the last week? © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto firm Prometheum gained an edge under Gary Gensler’s SEC. Suddenly its future appears less certain

For years, the crypto industry has complained about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hard-line stance, and its refusal to develop rules that account for blockchain’s distinct technology. One firm, though, claimed the SEC’s current crypto rules are just fine. This stance has paid off as the firm, Prometheum, won a first-of-its-kind license for crypto-based securities and—despite being virtually unknown in the crypto world—landed a prestigious slot in 2023 to testify about digital assets before Congress. But now Prometheum has a problem. The election of pro-crypto Donald Trump has led SEC Chair Gary Gensler to announce he will quit his position early next year. So now the firm—whose apparent inside track with the regulator appeared to give it an edge—must compete in a world where the rules of the crypto game are shifting dramatically. Most notably, there is an emerging consensus that many cryptocurrencies will not be considered securities when Trump is president. This is different from the current regulatory environment, where SEC’s Gensler has signaled that every token other than Bitcoin is a security, and filed lawsuits that have forced companies to delist popular tokens like Solana and XRP. Since the election, however, firms like Coinbase and Robinhood have re-listed those assets in anticipation of an incoming SEC chair who will not treat those tokens as securities. This is a potential problem for Prometheum since its business model has been based in large part on selling itself as a platform where crypto tokens are securities, and obtaining the legal infrastructure to support that. It’s unclear where this leaves Prometheum, which has attracted widespread derision from crypto figures over its role as Gensler’s model for the industry. Meanwhile, the firm faces an incoming Congress controlled by hostile Republicans, including figures like John Rose (R-Tenn.), who have accused it of having ties to China. Prometheum strongly denies that allegation. In response to questions from Fortune about Prometheum’s future in a post-Gensler world, the firm supplied written answers from Aaron Kaplan, who shares CEO duties with his brother. According to Kaplan, Prometheum has an opportunity to move beyond crypto and use its first-of-its-kind license (known as special purpose broker-dealer) to offer a wide variety of assets, including “equities, debt instruments, structured products, options, ETFs, money market funds” and more in the form of securities on a blockchain. “We expect that President Trump’s administration will oversee this market transformation as trillions of securities are issued on a blockchain, ushering in the benefits that blockchain technology has long promised market participants,” Kaplan wrote. Others are not so sure. Matt Walsh, cofounder of the influential crypto venture capital firm Castle Island who has been an outspoken critic of Prometheum, told Fortune he has seen little in the way of evidence that anyone is using the firm’s platform for real-world trading. And while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, alongside crypto native firms like Superstate, are dabbling in tokenized traditional assets, this remains for now a very niche area of finance. In response to a question about whether Prometheum can point to real-world clients or other evidence of gaining traction in the market, Kaplan said the firm is still in “the very early stages” and that it is “actively engaged in discussions with financial institutions.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-bitcoin-to-altcoins-crypto-inflows-hit-record-3-1-billion-led-by-spot-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T00:30:20Z

The crypto market witnessed a significant milestone last week as investment products recorded roughly $3.13 billion in net inflows globally, primarily driven by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to data from CoinShares. This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal development. It provides institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to digital assets. As a result, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a shift toward mainstream adoption, further supported by strong price performance and consistent inflows across various investment products.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Volatility Amid Strong AI Demand and Growth Opportunities

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system."

Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Envestnet Finalizes $4.5 Billion Go-Private Deal With Bain Capital

Wealth technology provider Envestnet has officially become a private company. The firm announced Monday (Nov. 25) that it had closed its acquisition by affiliates of vehicles managed or advised by Bain Capital, a deal worth roughly $4.5 billion. “This represents an exciting new chapter in Envestnet’s history, paving the way for accelerated growth and building on our position as a leading wealth management platform in the industry,” Jim Fox, Envestnet’s board chair and interim CEO, said in a news release. Added Tom Sipp, Envestnet’s executive vice president: “Together with Bain Capital, Envestnet will continue to deliver on its mission, empowering firms and advisors with the wealth technology and solutions to holistically serve their clients.” The company had announced its plans to go private in July. Also taking part in the deal were Reverence Capital and Norwest, along with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. According to the release, Envestnet has $6.5 trillion in platform assets, more than 20 million accounts and serves more than 111,000 financial advisors. The company’s technology, advanced insights and comprehensive solutions are designed to help financial advisors improve business growth, productivity and provide better client outcomes. In other news from the financial advice world, PYMNTS spoke last month with Doug Brown, chief product officer, digital banking at Candescent, about the pressures consumers feel in seeking such advice, with many plagued by a fear of missteps. “The best partner is in fact the local community bank who understands them and their environment better than most,” Brown told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “There’s been a lot of outreach from both banks and others trying to inform, but what they’re probably doing is creating a little bit more panic than rational help. That’s why consumers are seeking a company they can trust to guide through this.” Credit unions and smaller banks “want to be top of mind with the small businesses and the consumers in the communities they serve,” Brown added. These financial institutions, which have existing relationships with consumers, should be natural financial advisors. But research by PYMNTS Intelligence and NCR Voyix (as Candescent was once known) found that only 57% of customers looked to their banks for financial advice last year. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

(NYSE:WDAY) is an enterprise-focused software company that provides human resource and financial management software. This exposes the firm to the labor market as HR software typically does well when firms have adequate hiring budgets in a relaxed monetary environment. Consequently, with interest rates in the US just recently coming off of a 24-year high, it's unsurprising that Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s shares are down 4% year-to-date. However, the pent-up potential in the stock due to monetary constraints is also evident through the fact that since the November presidential election, the shares have gained 6.70%. Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) has struggled particularly hard due to increasing costs as it posted operating losses each year between 2021 and 2023. However, improved financial performance can carry significant tailwinds, as was evident following Q2 results when the stock jumped by 12.5% after Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s $2.085 billion revenue and $1.75 in EPS beat analyst estimates of $2.071 billion and $1.65. Polen Capital mentioned Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. Workday is still growing revenue at a mid-to-high-teens rate, but in recent years, slower macroeconomic growth has made closing deals more challenging. Amidst a pullback, we increased our position as we found the valuation attractive for a well-positioned, recurring revenue business with still strong growth potential. The company also recently stated publicly that it will be focused on expanding profit margins meaningfully over the next five years—something we have expected and are pleased to see.” Overall WDAY ranks 10th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of WDAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WDAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
