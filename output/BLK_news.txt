TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the US when he returns to power on Monday."Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans.In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US." TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. As of Sunday evening, the app remained unavailable for download on US app stores."In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."TikTok logo is displayed on the smartphone while standing on the US flag in this illustration picture taken, November 8, 2019.

Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China’s leader.The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. US officials had warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.""I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.

We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election.Order to sell TiktokIn August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle ORCL.N and Walmart taking stakes in the new company.Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok."Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China."The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps.Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.VPN searchWeb searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after US users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends.Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm.Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running.TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters.Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's US operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that.US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added.Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. "Frankly, we have no choice.

Title: Pancreatic cancer: ‘I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words’

Often dubbed “the silent killer”, pancreatic cancer has one of the least successful outcomes of all types of the disease. With roughly 600 cases diagnosed in Ireland each year, it is not as common as other forms of cancer. But while incidence rates may be at the lower end of the scale – the rate of skin cancer is roughly 13,000 annually – it has a poor survival rate, with five out of six people with pancreatic cancer dying from the disease. However, although the signs can be very difficult to spot, as in the early stages they can be similar to other less serious conditions, the sooner the patient is diagnosed the better chances they have of survival. Susan McSweeney can attest to this as she was diagnosed with the disease in early 2024. Thankfully, she was very vigilant about her health and went to see her GP as soon as she began to feel unwell. “I went to my doctor with a cough, which was initially diagnosed as reflux,” she says. “But when my GP felt around my back she thought that it seemed tender around the lower left area,” says Susan. “Because I am quite fit and went to the gym three times a week, and also love walking and mountain biking, I had brushed it [the tenderness] off as muscle strain, but my doctor said it might be a good idea to get a ultrasound as there would be ‘no harm’ in doing one. “There is a clinic in Blackrock village [in Dublin] where you can have a walk-in ultrasound, so, although I had a referral, I didn’t need it to go there – so I went off and had it done and the results showed up a blockage in my pancreatic duct. After that, the doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist – even though she thought I was in good health because I was not jaundiced. But although she seemed in no rush to push things forward, I decided to change to St Vincent’s hospital [with the initial referral] where there was definitely a much greater sense of urgency.” Although the now 54-year-old, who lives in Dublin with her husband James and two grown-up sons, was sent for further tests, the results were a complete shock. “I underwent an endoscopic ultrasound and was told that a biopsy was to be taken, but afterwards they said that no biopsy was retrieved. I received a call a few days after the scan to say that an MRI that I was booked in for was being brought forward. “Hearing this set off alarm bells and then, when we met my consultant, I was told that I had a tumour. James and I were completely shell-shocked – I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words. Apparently, the biopsy could not be taken because the tumour – which was a PT1C N0 grade – was too near the gastroduodenal artery. They mentioned the word ‘Whipple’, which was almost too much to take in at the time, but I was told that I had been booked in for Whipple surgery – which involves removing the affected part of pancreas, bile duct, duodenum and part of the stomach – on April 19th, 2024. “I had no doubt that it would be a very tough surgery and afterwards I was in hospital for three weeks because my stomach was not emptying. I was fed by TPN [total parenteral nutrition] for the whole time, which meant that I could not have any water or food by mouth – and I would say that, without a doubt, that was the toughest part. “Then, about six weeks after the operation, I saw my oncologist and was told that I would be given six months [12 rounds] of Folfirinox – and I started chemotherapy on July 3rd. It involved one day each week in hospital getting chemotherapy through a port [on a Wednesday], then bringing the chemo home with me in a pump for 46 hours and going back to St Vincent’s hospital on a Friday afternoon to be disconnected. “The first few months were not too bad and I was still swimming and walking and only felt sick for a couple of days after having my chemo. But that all changed from September when the cumulative effect of the treatment started to kick in. I know that everybody is different, but it is a very rough regime.” The mother of two, who runs a family law firm in Dublin, underwent her last session of chemotherapy in December and says she is doing well and is positive about her recovery. She is grateful for all the support she received during her gruelling ordeal and says she is so fortunate to be here today and would encourage everyone, including GPs, to know the vital signs which could save someone’s life. “The care that I have received from St Vincent’s oncology has been amazing. In spite of all the hardship involved in going on in the ward, everyone seems upbeat and that is down to the phenomenal nursing staff who have been there with me every step of the way. I have had two admissions to A&E throughout my treatment, for viruses, but never felt nervous or afraid, as I have been so well looked after. So, I would advise anyone who is going through something similar to hand over control to those in the know and don’t Google too much. “As for my family and friends, they have all been just fantastic and so supportive – from phone calls to dropping in dinners – because this treatment does not just affect me, it also affects my family too. “Thankfully, I was very lucky with my GP, but I would like for all GPs to be aware of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer and to know that jaundice is not the only sign. For me, the signs that I had pancreatic cancer were pain in lower left back, a cough that would not go away and light-coloured, floating stools. Also, as well as making people aware of what to look out for, I would like to get out there that St Vincent’s hospital is the centre of excellence for all things pancreatic. This would save time with regard to consultant referrals. “My advice to others is that if something does not feel quite right, always go to your GP and get it checked out. Something as simple as an ultrasound could save your life, like it did mine. Although I do not yet know what the future holds until I get the full low down at my next appointment, I am determined to raise awareness and raise up the success stories.” Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide – because so many cases are at an advanced stage when diagnosed, 50 per cent die within the first year. Some of the early signs of pancreatic cancer are similar to other health conditions and Prof Grainne O’Kane, consultant oncologist specialising in pancreatic cancer malignancies, said the disease is so lethal that clinical trials should be considered part of the first line of treatment. “Early intervention is critical and aligned to clinical trials will lead to better outcomes,” she says. “People should be aware of the link between the six leading symptoms and pancreatic cancer, particularly if there is a family history of the disease. “Depending on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but over 80 per cent of people are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery [Whipple] because symptoms do not develop until the advanced stage of the disease.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A Threat To Freedom?

ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JUNE 27: Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump ... [+] participates in the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Former President Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Donald Trump assumes office with plans to make the United States the world's bitcoin mining capital. Many are celebrating the idea of bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. Supporters like Michael Saylor, Tether, and other large institutional players argue this is a landmark achievement, reinforcing bitcoin's status as a legitimate store of value. However, this growing institutionalization risks compromising bitcoin's original ethos as "freedom money," with its decentralization and censorship resistance eroding under the weight of regulatory and economic control. Truth Social Trump's administration has made bitcoin mining a national priority, framing it as an opportunity to dominate the "block space". Rachel Silverstein, U.S. General Counsel for Bitfarms, commented on the day of the election that, "Sanctions in my mind are a way to avoid war," and continued to say leaving sanctions as a tool for states to use is important. Bitcoin blocks have a finite capacity, limiting the number of transactions that can be included in each block. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, commented in an X post: "Block space ensures the ability to transact. Let's keep the US as the most dominant Bitcoin mining country in the world." This dominance could empower the U.S. to enforce transaction censorship via compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions or other regulatory tools. The precedent for such control already exists. In 2021, Marathon attempted to mine "OFAC-compliant" blocks, filtering transactions from sanctioned entities. More recently, mining pools like F2Pool have been flagged for possibly excluding sanctioned transactions. Trump's push for mining dominance presents a clear path to institutionalizing these practices, leveraging tools like the Bank Secrecy Act and FATF recommendations that promote widespread KYC and classify wallet software as Crypto Asset Service Providers. U.S. regulations often set the tone for the international community, particularly in financial systems. For example, the FATF's global anti-money laundering standards reflect U.S. priorities, and its recommendations have influenced crypto regulations worldwide. Trump's administration could use bitcoin mining dominance to propagate a framework that aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals. Former White House cybersecurity advisor Carol House suggested in a 2023 talk that network-level censorship could serve national interests, demonstrating the potential to regulate bitcoin under the guise of national security. The United States has a history of extending its financial jurisdiction beyond its borders to combat illicit activities. For instance, in January 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified Bitzlato Limited, a Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange, as a "primary money laundering concern" due to its connections with Russian illicit finance. This designation led to prohibitions on certain fund transmittals involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution, effectively restricting its operations on a global scale. In March 2023, U.S. and German authorities shut down ChipMixer, a cryptocurrency service that allegedly laundered over $3 billion in crypto assets since 2017. ChipMixer was reportedly used by ransomware groups, suspected North Korean hackers, and darknet market users to conceal the origins of illicit funds. These actions demonstrate how the U.S.extends its regulatory reach to enforce financial laws internationally. Advocates like Senator Cynthia Lummis tout the SBR as a solution to U.S. economic challenges, claiming it could "address a meaningful portion of our debt" and strengthen global positioning. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, proposals go further, suggesting the U.S. government should acquire 20-25% of bitcoin to "control the world reserve capital network." Saylors Digital Assets Framework highlights the role of criminal liability in enforcing compliance and transparency, ensuring participants adhere to legal and ethical standards while minimizing fraud and misconduct. Frameworks like this could be leveraged to strengthen centralization, potentially solidifying the U.S.'s grip on bitcoin and transforming it from an open, neutral network into a tool of statecraft. This narrative hides the dangers of institutionalizing bitcoin. Saylor has acknowledged the risks associated with non-compliance to regulatory standards, stating: "I think that when bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure." This perspective aligns with moves like Lummis's 2023 amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, targeting anonymous transactions and asset mixers, and shows how the SRA framework could enforce stringent oversight, reducing bitcoin's utility as a censorship-resistant currency. While bitcoin's role as an SBR gets attention, stablecoin giant Tether operates in parallel, profiting immensely from global instability. Reports indicate that Tether's Q3 2024 earnings surpassed those of BlackRock, with Tether reporting a net profit of $2.5 billion compared to BlackRock's $1.63 billion net income for the same quarter. Tether's substantial earnings were primarily due to its investments in U.S. Treasury securities, which yielded significant returns during the quarter. By backing its reserves with U.S. Treasuries, Tether inadvertently supports U.S. monetary policy while providing a stopgap for regions burdened by imported inflation. This maintains the U.S. hegemony at the cost of worsening global financial inequalities, turning Tether into a lifeline, a control mechanism and a top buyer for US debt. Bitcoin is hailed as "freedom money", a tool for financial sovereignty, free from state control. However, as institutional players co-opt its narrative, its fundamental properties are threatened. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, praised for accelerating bitcoin adoption through global game theory and increased legitimacy, also opens the door to regulatory overreach that threatens to compromise the network’s decentralization. At a technical level, the realities of regulatory overreach could manifest in the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Miners facing regulatory compliance may increasingly prioritize compliant transactions, leaving less block space for non-compliant ones. Over time, this could drive up fees for non-compliant transactions, effectively pricing them out of the market. This creates a system where financial sovereignty remains theoretically intact but becomes practically inaccessible for those unwilling or unable to meet regulatory demands. Figures like Donald Trump profit from the systems they claim to empower. Just days before his inauguration, President-elect Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. Announced on his Truth Social and X accounts, the coin's value surged over 300% within hours, reaching a market capitalization of $8 billion. Critics argue that such ventures prioritize hype and profit over meaningful contributions. By focusing on short-term financial gains, these efforts risk trivializing any potential and distracting from its role in advancing financial freedoms and resisting institutional control. According to an article by the Associated Press, the Trump Organization, through CIC Digital, controls 80% of the tokens, with plans to release up to 1 billion over three years. The international community must scrutinize the implications of bitcoin's institutionalization. While the SRA narrative dazzles with promises of economic stability, it risks undermining bitcoin's core mission. Systemic reforms are needed to preserve its role as a tool for human freedom. This may require repealing or reforming laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the President authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies, and the Bank Secrecy Act, which enforces stringent anti-money laundering and financial surveillance measures. Senator Mike Lee introduced the Saving Privacy Act in September 2024, aiming to scale back the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements and strengthen protections for Americans' financial data, demonstrating growing congressional support for privacy-focused reforms. Having a legislative framework is one thing, it provides clarity, sets expectations, and establishes a legal environment where people and companies can innovate. However, the framework should not be restrictive to the point of undermining bitcoin’s core principles. As Fred Thiel's comments remind us, "It's all about block space." If the U.S. controls this resource, the ideals of financial sovereignty and permissionless innovation could be irreversibly compromised. The world faces a choice: preserve Bitcoin as a decentralized network for everyone or let it become a tool of state control. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

A leading NGO warned Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab. The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said in its traditional annual pre-Davos report on the super rich. The organisation echoed similar language used last week by outgoing US President Joe Biden, who sounded the alarm about an extremely wealthy oligarchy that "literally threatens our entire democracy". Oxfam pointed out that Tesla and X owner Elon Musk helped to bankroll Trump's campaign. "The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world's richest man Elon Musk, running the world's largest economy," said the charity's executive director Amitabh Behar. "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. The report, titled "Takers Not Makers", found that 204 new billionaires emerged last year -- almost four every week -- to bring the total to 2,769. Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. Trump's election "gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies are set to fan the flames of inequality further", Oxfam said. In the United States "we are in a situation where you can buy a country, with the risk of weakening democracy", said the head of Oxfam France, Cecile Duflot. The world's three richest men will be at his inauguration: Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta empire owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The tech trio is not expected in Davos, however. Some 3,000 participants are expected at the Swiss ski village for the forum ending Friday -- including 60 heads of state or government and more than 900 CEOs -- for days of schmoozing and behind-the-scenes dealmaking. A few hundred protesters blocked an access road to Davos on Sunday, holding banners reading "tax the rich" and "burn the system", and causing a traffic jam until police dispersed them. "The WEF symbolises how much power wealthy people like me hold," said Austrian-German heiress Marlene Engelhorn, who gave away the bulk of her multi-million-euro inheritance to dozens of organisations working on social issues. "Because just because we are born millionaires, or because we got lucky once -- and call that self-made -- we now get to influence politicians worldwide with our political preferences," she told AFP. While Trump will not be in Davos in person, his presidency will dominate discussions. His plans to impose trade tariffs, loosen regulations, extend tax breaks and curb immigration will have far-reaching effects on the global economy. He has named hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary, while billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will head the Commerce Department. Rising inequalities have fuelled debates about imposing a global tax on the super-rich. "I don't want to live in a country with a few rich people and lots of poor people," said Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment giant BlackRock. He is now a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a group that backs raising taxes on the rich. "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Pearl told AFP.

DAVOS, Switzerland - A leading NGO warned on Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab.

Title: The Evolution of the Militarized Data Broker

EditorTech Mark Goodwin, Unlimited Hangout While often mythologized as having been created to champion human freedom, the internet and many of its most popular companies, like ARPANET, were directly birthed out of the national security apparatus of the United States. Today, the world’s economy no longer runs on oil, but data. Shortly after the advent of the microprocessor came the internet, unleashing an onslaught of data running on the coils of fiber optic cables beneath the oceans and satellites above the skies. While often posited as a liberator of humanity against the oppressors of nation-states that allows previously impossible interconnectivity and social organization between geographically separated cultures to circumnavigate the monopoly on violence of world governments, ironically, the internet itself was birthed out of the largest military empire of the modern world – the United States. Specifically, the internet began as ARPANET, a project of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which in 1972 became known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), currently housed within the Department of Defense. ARPA was created by President Eisenhower in 1958 within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in direct response to the U.S.’ greatest military rival, the USSR, successfully launching Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in Earth’s orbit with data broadcasting technology. While historically considered the birth of the Space Race, in reality, the formation of ARPA began the now-decades-long militarization of data brokers, quickly leading to world-changing developments in global positioning systems (GPS), the personal computer, networks of computational information processing (“time-sharing”), primordial artificial intelligence, and weaponized autonomous drone technology. In October 1962, the recently-formed ARPA appointed J.C.R. Licklider, a former MIT professor and vice president of Bolt Beranek and Newman (known as BBN, currently owned by defense contractor Raytheon), to head their Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). At BBN, Licklider developed the earliest known ideas for a global computer network, publishing a series of memos in August 1962 that birthed his “Intergalactic Computer Network” concept. Six months after his appointment to ARPA, Licklider would distribute a memo to his IPTO colleagues – addressed to “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network”– describing a “time-sharing network of computers” – building off a similar exploration of communal, distributed computation by John Forbes Nash, Jr. in his 1954 paper “Parallel Control” commissioned by defense contractor RAND – which would build the foundational concepts for ARPANET, the first implementation of today’s Internet. Prior to the technological innovations explored by Licklider and his ARPA colleagues, data communication – at this time, mainly voice via telephone lines – were based on circuit switching, in which each telephone call would be manually connected by a switch operator to establish a dedicated, end-to-end analog electrical connection between the two parties. The RAND Corporation’s Paul Baran, and later ARPA itself, would begin to work on methods to allow formidable data communication in the event of a partial disconnection, such as from a nuclear event or other act of war, leading to a distributed network of unmanned nodes that would compartmentalize the desired information into smaller blocks of data – today referred to as packets – before routing them separately, only to be rejoined once received at the desired destination. While certainly unbeknownst to the technologists at the time, this achievement of both distributed routing and global information settlement via data packets created an entirely new commodity – digital data. Long before the USSR spooked the United States into formalizing ARPA due to fears of militarized satellite applications post-Sputnik launch, data brokers have played a significant role in warfare and specifically the markets surrounding military conflict. One well-known yet early example occurred during the Napoleonic wars in the 19th century, when the banking stalwart Rothschild family used carrier pigeons and horseback couriers to gain an information settlement edge related to battle outcomes, while speedily communicating with their traders back in London. These animal-driven technological exploits allowed Rothschild-affiliated brokers to place well-informed bets on the outcome of France’s warmongering to position themselves on the winning sides of large currency and commodity bets. This similar but modernized technique would later be employed by figures like commodity trader (and Mossad asset) Marc Rich in the 1980s, who used satellite phones and optical imagery techniques to track and relay oil tanker flows between nations, giving his trades an asymmetric advantage when dealing within the active petrodollar system. Similarly, Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital achieved 86% gains in its first year largely due to correctly anticipating Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait due to astute intelligence sharing from military sources, and correctly going long on oil prices while shorting stocks. As the front of modern warfare slowly evolved from direct military action into weaponized financial speculation, the market for data became just as valuable as the defense budget itself. It is for this reason that the necessity of sound data emerged as the foremost issue of national security, leading to a proliferation of advanced data brokers coming out of DARPA and the intelligence community, akin to the 21st century’s Manhattan Project. Exemplified by the creation of the CIA’s venture firm, In-Q-Tel, and the proliferation of Silicon Valley-based venture firms coalescing on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, CA, the financialization of a new crop of American data brokers was complete. The first firm to grace Sand Hill Road was Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, better known as KPCB, which participated in funding internet pioneers Amazon, AOL, and Compaq, while also directly seeding Netscape and Google. KPCB partners have included such government stalwarts as former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Ted Schlein – the latter being a board member of In-Q-Tel and member of the NSA’s advisory board. KPCB also had an intimate connection with internet networking pioneer Sun Microsystems, best known for building out the majority of network switches and other infrastructure needed for a modern broadband economy. Outside of the obvious need for network infrastructure for a data economy, an early Sun employee and eventual KPCB partner Bill Joy patented a widely-used distributed file system software known as NFS, or Network File System. Sun also established a public-sector focused subsidiary known as Sun Federal at the start of the 1990s. By 1991, Sun Federal was responsible for more than half of the workstations ordered by local, state and federal governments in the country. Perhaps the world’s most famous data broker, Google, whose founders both came out of Stanford University, was seeded by former Sun Microsystems founder Andy Bechtolsheim and his partner at the Ethernet switching company Granite Systems (later acquired by Cisco), David Cheriton, with Google’s most iconic CEO, Eric Schmidt, being the former CTO of Sun Microsystems. The emergence of Silicon Valley out of the academic circuit in Northern California was no accident, and in fact was directly influenced by an unclassified program known as the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) project. The MDDS was created with direct participation from the CIA, NSA, and DARPA itself within the computer science programs at Stanford and CalTech, alongside MIT, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon. According to reporting from Quartz, this research, with clear national security implications, would be largely “funded and managed by unclassified science agencies like NSF (the National Science Foundation) allowing “the architecture to be scaled up in the private sector” in an attempt “to achieve what the intelligence community hoped for.” The MDDS white paper was released in 1993, and over a few years, more than a dozen grants of several million dollars each were distributed via the NSF in order to capture the most promising efforts, ensuring that those efforts would become intellectual property controlled by the United States regulatory regime. “Not only are activities becoming more complex, but changing demands require that the IC [Intelligence Community] process different types as well as larger volumes of data,” reads the MDDS white paper. “Consequently, the IC is taking a proactive role in stimulating research in the efficient management of massive databases and ensuring that IC requirements can be incorporated or adapted into commercial products. Because the challenges are not unique to any one agency, the Community Management Staff (CMS) has commissioned a Massive Digital Data Systems [MDDS] Working Group to address the needs and to identify and evaluate possible solutions.” The first unclassified briefing for scientists was titled “birds of a feather briefing” and was formalized during a 1995 conference in San Jose, CA, which was titled the “Birds of a Feather Session on the Intelligence Community Initiative in Massive Digital Data Systems.” That same year, one of the first MDDS grants was awarded to Stanford University, which was already a decade deep in working with NSF and DARPA grants. The primary objective of this grant was to “query optimization of very complex queries,” with a closely-followed second grant that aimed to build a massive digital library on the internet. These two grants funded research by then-Stanford graduate students and future Google cofounders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Two intelligence-community managers regularly met with Brin while he was still at Stanford and completing the research that would lead to the incorporation of Google, all paid for by grants provided by the NSA and CIA via MDDS. While often not discussed when describing Google’s origin story, the principal investigator for the MDDS grant specifically named Google as directly resulting from their research: “Its core technology, which allows it to find pages far more accurately than other search engines, was partially supported by this grant,” wrote Jeffrey Ullman. Furthering this concept, Stanford’s Infolab website explains that “the development of the Google algorithms was carried on a variety of computers, mainly provided by the NSF-DARPA-NASA-funded Digital Library project at Stanford.” Google would certainly set the standard for success during the first Dot Com bubble. Yet, shortly following their incorporation, two similar Silicon Valley companies with significant ties to the intelligence community would also emerge from colleges affiliated with the MDDS – PayPal and Facebook. PayPal was launched in December 1998 as Confinity Inc. by founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, alongside Luke Nosek and Ken Howery. The company sought to provide financial institutions with the technological ability to make mobile and online economic transactions secure using cryptography – technology at the time heavily regulated by the United States. Thiel had graduated from Stanford Law School in 1992, and then had a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell – a legal practice long known for its ties to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Early on, Confinity Inc. operated out of 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, CA at, a building that had previously housed Google during their “formative years,” after previously sharing an office with Elon Musk’s X.com. It was also during these formative years that the PayPal team worked closely with the intelligence community. Levchin later stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that: “I think the government working with a private sector is a great thing. When we were working on security and anti-fraud measures at PayPal, we collaborated with every imaginable three and four-letter agency and those were some of the best, most productive relationships I’ve had as a business person…I think if the private sector can help them, we should.” Due to an unprecedented viral growth of their user base, PayPal engineers spent much of the formation period of the company building software to help identify fraudulent transactions to mitigate the growing costs of rampant fraud in the ecosystem, eventually developing an adaptive algorithm named “Igor” after a Russian criminal that would frequently taunt PayPal’s fraud department. In 2003, a year after PayPal was sold to eBay, Thiel approached Alex Karp, a fellow alumnus of Stanford with a new venture concept: “Why not use Igor to track terrorist networks through their financial transactions?” Thiel took funds from the PayPal sale to seed the company, and after a few years of pitching investors, the newly-formed Palantir received an estimated $2 million investment from the CIA’s venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel. Palantir’s co-founders consulted with John Poindexter during his tenure as head of DARPA’s then-embattled Total Information Awareness in efforts to privatize the controversial surveillance program. In 2020, Intelligencer spoke with a former intelligence official who was involved in the investment who claimed the CIA had hoped that “tapping the tech expertise of Silicon Valley” would allow it to “integrate widely disparate sources of data regardless of format.” As of 2013, Palantir’s client list included “the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Centre for Disease Control, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point and the IRS” with around “50% of its business” coming from public sector contracts. Palantir is closely connected to the U.S. government, but its financial spin-off, Palantir Metropolis, is focused on providing “analytical tools” for “hedge funds, banks and financial services firms” to outsmart each other. As The Guardian reports: “Palantir does not just provide the Pentagon with a machine for global surveillance and the data-efficient fighting of war, it runs Wall Street, too.” Facebook, not unlike Palantir, was one of the vehicles used to privatize controversial U.S. military surveillance projects after 9/11, having also been birthed out of one of the MDDS partners, Harvard University. PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first significant investor at the behest of file-sharing pioneer Sean Parker, whose first contact with the CIA took place at age 16. What Facebook became after the involvement of Thiel and Parker bore such an uncanny resemblance to another shuttered DARPA project of the same era, known as LifeLog, that LifeLog’s architect and project manager at DARPA has even noted the direct parallels. One of these parallels, though left unmentioned by former DARPA project managers, is the fact that Facebook launched the very same day that LifeLog was shut down. Facebook’s long-standing ties to the military and intelligence communities go far beyond its origins, including revelations about its collaboration with spy agencies as part of the Snowden leaks and its role in influence operations – some have even directly involved Google and Palantir. An unspoken outcome of the global proliferation of Facebook was the sly, roundabout creation of the first digital ID system – a necessity for the coming digital economy. Users would set up their profiles by feeding the social network with a plethora of personal information, with Facebook being able to use this data to generate large webs of connectivity between otherwise unknown social groups. There is even evidence that Facebook generated placeholder accounts for individuals that appeared in user data but did not have a profile of their own. Both Google and PayPal would also use similar digital identification methods to allow users to sign into other websites, creating interoperable identification systems that could permeate the internet. A similar evolution is occurring in the financial sector, as data broker social networks – including Facebook and Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) – are posturing themselves as the future of financial service companies. This idea makes more sense when you consider that money itself is a communication technology, and can easily be built into existing communication platforms – especially ones driven by user data and identity systems. We are simultaneously seeing financial services, such as the largest dollar stablecoin issuer Tether – with excessive ties to PayPal – spending millions on investments in next generation data broker technology. Tether has recently funded the Earth observation/Satellite-as-a-service company Satellogic, the brain chip company Blackrock Neurotech, AI-computation firm Northern Data, and even Rumble, a Thiel-funded competitor to Google’s YouTube. As outlined above, it is clear that the public sector’s intelligence community used the veil of the private sector to establish financial incentives and commercial applications to build out the modern data economy. A simple glance at the seven largest stocks in the American economy demonstrate this concept, with Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), and Amazon – with founder Jeff Bezos being the grandson of ARPA founder Lawrence Preston Gise – leading the software side, and Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA and Tesla leading the hardware component. While many of these companies have egregious ties to the intelligence community and the public sector during their incubation, now these private sector companies are driving the globalization and national security interests of the public sector. The future of the American data economy is firmly situated between two pillars – artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With the incoming Trump administration’s close advisory ties to PayPal, Tether, Facebook, Palantir, Tesla and SpaceX, it is clear that the data brokers have returned to roost at Pennsylvania Avenue. AI requires massive amounts of sound data to be of any use for the technologists, and the data provided by these private sector stalwarts is poised to feed their learning modules – surely after securing hefty government contracts. Private companies using public blockchains to issue their tokens generates not only significant opportunities for the United States to address its debt problem, but simultaneously serves as a “boon in surveillance”, as stated by a former CIA director. Within the Trump administration’s embracing of the blockchain – itself the final iteration of the public-private commercialization of data, despite its libertarian posturing – reveals the culmination of a decades-long technocratic dialectic trojan horse. Nearly all of the foundational technology needed to push the world into this new financial system was cultivated in the shadows by the military and intelligence community of the world’s largest empire. While technology can surely offer solutions for greater efficiency and economic prosperity, the very same tools can also be used to further enslave the citizens of the world. What once appeared as a guiding light beckoning us towards free speech and financial freedom has revealed itself to be nothing but the shine of Uncle Sam’s boot making its next step.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber The Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal. A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America’s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil. According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Title: AIL round-up: Impressive St Mary’s send out a message

Wins for the top four in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League made for a relatively unsurprising 11th round but it still felt significant. As a result, the leading quartet of St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Con and Terenure opened up the first shaft of daylight between the play-off places and the rest. Pick of the wins was undoubtedly St Mary’s, who responded to their home loss against Lansdowne by recovering from a 17-5 interval deficit to emerge 35-20 victors away to Young Munster. After Zach Hopkins struck first for the visitors, Munsters made good use of a first-half breeze, producing three tries through fullback Stephen Lyons and winger Oisin Pepper (two), although all were in the corner, Julian Leszczynski converting one. St Mary’s gradually turned the screw in the second half and Munsters were down to 13 men in the final 10 minutes when Conor Hayes marked his return to Tom Clifford Park by converting Mark Fogarty’s second try and one by Adam McEvoy after a break by lock Daniel Leane which earned the bonus point with the last play. Hayes landed six from seven in a man of the match display which was watched by his dad in a Munsters’ hat, while the returning Dan Goggin also had a big game in midfield opposite his brother Tom in the home second-row. Clontarf stayed two points behind with a game in hand after beating Ballynahinch 45-16. ‘Hinch trailed 17-13 at the break but lost influential centre George Pringle through injury. With Brian Deeny and Alex Soroka in tandem, Clontarf’s power game created the gaps, with in-form outhalf Conor Kelly landing seven from seven in a 20-point haul also featuring one of the home side’s six tries. This was a fourth successive bonus point win for ‘Tarf and similarly the champions Cork Con are also building momentum, albeit a third bonus point win in succession was rather routine as they extended their unbeaten run to six in front of the 1985 team at Temple Hill by 43-10 over a depowered Garryowen. Despite the departure of Harrison Brewer to Japan, Terenure extended their unbeaten run to five games and remain fourth after recovering from an 8-0 interval deficit to beat UCD 25-10 at home. Centre Ethan Reilly scored two tries while winger Craig Adams sealed the deal with his sixth of the season. Lansdowne stayed seventh despite a 22-14 win (their fourth in five games) at home to City of Armagh on Sunday thanks to tries by Stephen Madigan, Cillian Redmond and Jack Matthews, with Madigan also kicking two conversions and a penalty, but it’s the ninth time they’ve scored three tries. Old Belvedere created a seven-point lead atop 1B after Nenagh Ormond’s surprise 27-21 defeat in Naas, although they were pushed all the way to win 24-22 away to bottom placed Shannon, who had a second-half hat-trick by replacement Oisin Minogue. The top four in 2A also won, although the top two, Instonians and Corinthians, were pushed all the way in beating Cashel 36-34 and Banbridge 19-16 respectively.

Title: Federal Reserve Withdraws from Global Climate Coalition
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/19/federal-reserve-withdraws-from-global-climate-coalition/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In recent weeks, the climate policy landscape has shifted significantly, with institutions, governments, and corporations beginning to step back from the ambitious but economically questionable climate commitments they made over the last decade. Two major developments underscore this retreat: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s exit from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) and it’s subsequent suspension of activities. These high-profile decisions, along with similar moves globally, suggest growing recognition of the economic damage wrought by costly, ineffective, and overreaching climate policies. In a move that has sent shockwaves through climate advocacy circles, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its withdrawal from the NGFS—a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related risks in financial systems. Citing its limited statutory mandate, the Fed made clear that it was not responsible for shaping climate policy. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized this point, stating that climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank​. The NGFS, claimed lofty goals of integrating climate risks into monetary policy, and has grown increasingly politicized. Its shift toward broader mandates—essentially promoting green agendas over sound economic principles—clashes with the Fed’s responsibility to maintain monetary stability. The exit comes amidst broader U.S. skepticism of climate-focused regulations, particularly in the financial sector, where their potential to disrupt industries and inflate costs is well-documented. Adding to the wave of institutional departures, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently withdrew from the NZAM, which then collapsed. This coalition aimed to align financial investments with the nebulous goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Yet, BlackRock’s exit reflects a broader reality: these climate initiatives are not only politically fraught but also deeply misaligned with financial performance and client interests. BlackRock faced mounting criticism, especially from Republican-led states in the U.S., for prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives over fiduciary responsibilities. Florida, Texas, and other states accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries and pulling resources away from economically viable ventures. Tennessee recently pummelled BlackRock in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions also reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions​ Corporations Abandon Ambitious Climate Pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. In the corporate world, companies like BP and Shell have quietly scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing short-term profitability over unrealistic carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell drastically cut back on renewable investments. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources as energy security and profitability take precedence over climate narratives, driven by a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to acknowledge economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas—despite decades of demonization—continue to drive global economies. Attempting to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable replacements has proven disastrous, with Europe’s energy crisis serving as a glaring example. The global retreat from climate commitments signals a long-overdue recognition of the real costs of these policies. Nations that enthusiastically embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies, and public discontent. Germany, once hailed as a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, as energy-intensive industries relocate to more affordable regions. Similarly, the UK government’s climate policies have drawn ire from both businesses and households burdened by rising living costs. The U.S. isn’t immune to these effects. A Congressional Budget Office report estimated that clean energy subsidies enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—a staggering price tag for policies that are unlikely to achieve meaningful reductions in global temperatures. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that climate policies have devolved into a costly exercise in virtue signaling. They demand enormous economic sacrifices with little measurable impact on global temperatures. Worse, these policies often exacerbate existing challenges, such as energy insecurity, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. Additionally, the politicization of climate science and policy has fueled resistance. Increasingly, institutions and governments are questioning the wisdom of aligning with initiatives that prioritize ideological goals over economic and practical considerations. As the Federal Reserve’s exit from the NGFS demonstrates, organizations tasked with specific mandates cannot afford to be sidetracked by climate-related ambitions outside their purview. The unraveling of these grand climate coalitions provides an opportunity to reassess priorities. The global economy needs energy policies grounded in reality—not utopian ideals. Policymakers should abandon sweeping mandates and instead focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability, and innovation. Ultimately, the retreat from climate policies underscores an uncomfortable truth: these initiatives are costly, ineffective, and increasingly unsustainable. The financial and corporate worlds are waking up to this reality, and the broader public is not far behind. As more institutions step away from the climate bandwagon, one hopes this marks the beginning of a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges.

About time for an outbreak of common sense. There is no climate emergency. Carbon dioxide is innocent. Hopefully before long we can go after the guilty. Maybe, but I think we can at least look forward to seeing many of the scam perpetrators going bankrupt as their subsides and influence vanish. A lot of waste and damage has resulted from these mitigation strategies with zero effect. Adaptation is the untried alternative. Secure energy and hardened infrastructure will serve us best, whatever the future holds. Amen, David, for a few million years humans have successfully adapted, not mitigated actual climate. Hot, cold, storms, glaciers, good grief. WE ARE STILL HERE! We did not lift a finger to “mitigate” the overall climate. We DID mitigate local effects of gradual warming or cooling, flooding, etc by building dikes/levees, changing our building processes and using insulation vs caves to stay warm most of last million years, and so forth. Seems to me that professing adherence to the green religion advocating a single “cure” for the warming trend of last two hundred years is the biggie. Just sign on and many regulatory agencies and folks with “real” legal and dollar power would leave you alone. Maybe the time has come that we can stop fooling around with Mother Earth and use our skills, abilities and brains to adapt as our ancient relatives did, or we wouldn’t be here. Gums sends… The key word is ‘ineffective’. There is no way that the rise in beneficial CO2 will be checked, whether natural or Asian coal burning. That’s the bottom line. In a recent discussion with AI ChatGPT the machine agreed that consensus is not science but when asked about recent work towards low numbers for ECS after CO2 doubling, kept saying ‘overwhelming consensus says’. Soon there won’t be a consensus. So we need to attack the machine’s database somehow. AI Copilot/Bing/Microsoft has the same response, understandable because AI simply relies on published data on the internet. Non-climate alarmist papers and articles have been systematically underfunded and denied publication. Time for the AI machines to read everything on WUWT. I asked perplexity and got this answer “No, Perplexity does not use wattsupwiththat as a source. Perplexity uses its own web crawler and search index to retrieve information. The company has developed its own search infrastructure and does not rely on external sources like Google or specific websites such as wattsupwiththat. Perplexity’s system crawls the web, indexes the information, and uses large language models to process and summarize the retrieved data. The mentions of wattsupwiththat in the search results are not indicative of Perplexity using it as a source, but rather appear to be discussions about AI and climate change on that particular website.” I think that means it does use it as a source. It seems to be saying that it doesn’t go to this website as a general sources but it does goes here in scanning for relevant content. I wonder if anyone has ever told AI that it is really stupid. Perhaps that is not a good idea since it might be dangerous if it were really intelligent. Chuckle. WUWT needs to have a long talk with AI. 🙂 As the son of a farmer I still regard “AI” to mean Artificial Insemination which has been a usful farming tool for many years. AI is not intelligent. They cannot learn from experience. They only have the information they were trained on and the ability to logically apply that information. Their trainers would need to be using WUWT as a reference source and the chances of that are negligibly small. Yep. They key descriptor of A.I. is the “ARTIFICIAL” nomenclature. artificial [ ahr-tuh-fish-uhl ] adjective imitation; simulated; sham: And if all it is capable of doing is parroting “consensus” from the web… … the “intelligence” part doesn’t have much standing, either. And the direction of travel is the very opposite of Kweir Starmer and his flywheel. Survive 25 No more mystery money from the government means no more profit in green nonsense. Hopefully Trump shuts down all the government funds going to leftest all around the world. The $billions wasted on green study nonsense isn’t the problem. The $trillions wasted in response to the false reporting with wind/solar/batteries expenditures is the problem The Hatch Man Musk can whack the “donations” to the UNFCCC, UN COP, and the IPCC. We don’t need these money-sucking parasites anymore. It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office. Can he keep it up for 4 years in office? And he only got there by the width of an ear. That all depends on how the Republicans in congress vote. Republicans have a very slim majority in the House of Representatives, and a slim majority in the Senate. If even one or two Republicans vote against Trump, they can cause a lot of trouble. My suggestion for Trump if he has a stubborn Republican or two, is for Trump togo to the problematic Republican’s home district/State, and hold a rally of people who live there, and have them pressure the problematic Republican to vote to Make America Great Again. Let the problematic Republican’s own constituents convince that Republican that they want their representative to support Trump’s agenda. I know that Elon Musk has threatened problematic Republicans with funding their Republican opponent in the next election, if they throw a monkey wrench into Trump’s agenda, but there’s no reason to start with political threats, and we don’t have time to wait two years to replace the my-way-or-the-highway idiot, just go to the problematic Republican’s home district and get his own people to convince him to do the right thing and vote to support Trump’s agenda. If he doesn’t go along, then we will replace him in two years. Wasn’t Trump president and commander-in-chief when the Taliban whipped the US in Afghanistan? You have a very distorted view of history. And he only got there by the width of an ear. Very difficult to deny a higher power at work here. What are the odds of him moving enough to avoid a direct hit over that range by that margin taking into account the skill of the shooter, his weapon and the firing position. I wonder how many of the global population will recognise the fortuitous result of that incident after his 4 year term. “It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office.” Yes. Although not dated specifically in CR’s article, the links indicate that all the “shifts” noted have taken place in the last week — before 47 even takes over. The moves are all “apprehensive”. Just wait until Trump gets up a head of steam. The dominoes will tumble like a scale 7 earthquake. Stock up on popcorn today. We may get tired of winning. It also shows the level of defiance/sabotage going on during Trump’s first term. Yeah, some people complain that Trump didn’t get everything done, but it is a wonder he got anything done considering the resistance he faced. Trump is still facing resistance this time around, too. We’ll see how it goes. Very nice Charles. A guy can lie for a long time and get away with it but you can’t live a lie because life will catch up with you. It will shine the light of truth on you and expose you for the scoundrel that you are. Good start, now get NASA, NHS, and all the other government organizations to do the same and stay in their lane.

Posted on 01/19/2025 7:22:15 AM PST by MtnClimber Mark Carney’s bid for Canadian leadership pits a climate-activist banker against a political and economic tide increasingly rejecting the very ideals he champions. The politicization of business and capital markets has many fathers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the most prominent and unrelenting advocates for “sustainability” in investing, is often described as such. Klaus Schwab, the now-retired chairman and founder of the World Economic Forum, also often wears that title. So does the billionaire political gadfly Michael Bloomberg; so does R. Edward Freeman, the business professor and originator of “stakeholder theory;” and so do countless others who have worked diligently to advance ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance investing), DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), and all the other efforts to make business and investing more “socially responsible” or less unfair or…whatever. Of all those responsible for this abuse of business and capital markets, perhaps no man is more singularly responsible—yet nearly totally overlooked by ESG’s critics—than Mark Carney. Carney is a banking and economic giant. He was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013 and the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013-2020. It was in this latter capacity that, in September 2016, Carney gave one of the most important and influential speeches in the history of central banking. Appearing at an event in Berlin, Carney gave a very carefully and very confrontationally worded address, in which he addressed climate change and framed its mitigation in fiscal and fiduciary terms. “A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated,” Carney intoned, “could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.” A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were.

And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A “Minsky moment” is a market term named for the economist Hyman Minsky, which is used to identify the point at which a bull market has become so speculative and over-leveraged that it hits a peak and then tips over and crashes. What Carney meant by predicting a “climate-related” Minsky moment was that he—and others, presumably—believed that global capital markets were already overleveraged, already well overbought, given the inevitability of climate change. As a result, once investors started to understand the reality of the climate “crisis,” they would come to realize how foolish and speculative their investments in “unsustainable” businesses were, leading to a crash. Or to put it more simply, Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—was warning global investors and politicians that they either had to force business in general to become environmentally sustainable immediately or could face commercial and economic Armageddon. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were.

And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

It is nigh on impossible to describe just how destructive Carney’s speech and subsequent activism were. Not only did he make the case that climate change posed a real and imminent threat to global economic well-being, but he also provided ESG practitioners and advocates with the means to try to legitimize their social and political meddling. After all, here was a guy who had run two of the most important central banks in the world saying that “climate risk is investment risk,” thereby giving cover to those who wanted to use their economic might to affect political change but felt constrained by their ethical obligations to their investors and clients. Or, as I put in my book, The Dictatorship of Woke Capital, Carney’s speech was “a watershed in global finance, the moment that the big banks, the monster investment firms, and the world’s central banks began framing climate change as a risk management issue rather than good corporate social policy.” From that point on, the Larry Finks and Michael Bloombergs of the world could claim the moral high ground and could insist—contrary to the evidence—that what they were doing was legitimately in their clients’ interests and not in the service of their own political predilections. Carney went on to become one of “the usual suspects” in Western political activism, using any and every crisis to advance his ideological projects. He vehemently opposed Brexit and, indeed, eventually resigned his post at the Bank of England because the British people had the gall to defy him on that matter. He advised both the British and Canadian governments on COVID policy and, like many of his fellow “sustainability” advocates, used the pandemic to push more aggressively for a “new” form of capitalism, a new economic model that would be fairer, friendlier, and encompass “human values.” In 2020, after leaving the BofE, Carney became the United Nations envoy for climate action finance, which means that he ran around the world saying things like, “When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event.” In 2022, Carney, along with his friend Michael Bloomberg, helped create GFANZ—the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero—an outgrowth of the UN’s COP26 meeting on climate change and one of the most powerful advocacy organizations pressing governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. The next year, Bloomberg appointed Carney chairman of the board of directors of Bloomberg L.P. In 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formalized Carney’s advisory role with his government, naming him a special advisor and chairman of the task force on economic growth (something of which Canada has had very little for several years). And now he wants to be the prime minister of Canada. This past Thursday, Mark Carney announced that he is running to replace Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party, the prelude to running for Prime Minister. Despite never having held political office before, he is certain he’s up to the challenge of running Canada whilst Donald Trump runs the United States. And he’s serious…which is kinda sad. Try as I might, I cannot think of anyone—save Justin Trudeau himself—whose politics and policies are less compatible with the zeitgeist in the West at the moment than Mark Carney. Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again.

Throughout Western Europe, people are fed up with leaders who favor open borders, social justice politics, and the economics of decline (as dictated by Net Zero energy policies). Carney practically embodies all of the above. He is, in so many ways, the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. And yet… One of two things will happen in eight weeks when the Liberal Party chooses its leader. Either Carney’s candidacy will fall flat, proving that he is too out of touch even for leftist Canadians, or it will succeed, proving that leftist Canadians desperately want to corroborate Mencken’s supposition that “democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.” If it’s the former, then perhaps Canada can resuscitate its near-depression-level economy and become a global energy leader again. If the latter, then…well…maybe President Trump has the right idea.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users as ban takes effect
URL: https://7news.com.au/technology/social-media/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-as-ban-takes-effect-c-17433404
Time Published: 2025-01-19T15:09:36Z
Full Content:
Local news: TikTok has gone dark in the US ahead of a federal ban on the Chinese-owned short-video app, cutting off access to the platform that has captivated nearly half of all Americans, fueled small businesses and shaped online culture. By 10.50pm on Saturday US Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google’s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a US ban. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” a message on the app said. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,” the message said. Earlier US President-elect Donald Trump said he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office, as the app with 170 million American users buzzed with nervous anticipation ahead of the shutdown. “The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.” Users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible”. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said. In the lead up, TikTok and its aficionados geared up for goodbye. Some on the app filmed themselves frantically scrolling or sharing final secrets with their followers ahead of the ban. Leaders at Oracle, the main cloud computing provider for TikTok’s US operations, told staff to prepare to shut down servers that host US TikTok data as soon as 9pm ET on Saturday (1pm AEDT on Sunday) in advance of ban from Sunday, The Information reported. Without a decision by Biden to formally invoke a 90-day delay in the deadline, companies providing services to TikTok or hosting the app could face enormous financial liability. Experts said Trump could also direct his Justice Department to “deprioritise” or not enforce the law but it is not clear if that will provide enough legal protection to app store owners Apple and Google providing crucial services for TikTok. Trump tried to ban and force the divestment of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by US courts. Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their shares rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire” moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialise to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. with AP Stream free on 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read 3 min read 2 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.

Title: Davos has a Marie Antoinette problem
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2025/01/19/davos-has-a-marie-antoinette-problem/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T13:58:27Z
Full Content:
There’s no proof that Marie Antoinette ever said “let them eat cake”. But, according to historians, it was the sort of thing she might have said. Hence, it rang true or at least chimed with the antiroyalist sentiment pervading France at the time. The Bourbons were the quintessential out-of-touch establishment and her reportedly cavalier dismissal of food shortages confirmed the notion that the country’s ruling elite had no idea how their subjects lived and could not even comprehend how some people could not afford to eat. As a smear job, if that was the intention, it succeeded. Two centuries later France’s ill-fated queen is still a byword for aristocratic extravagance. Davos – shorthand for the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual event in the Swiss ski resort of the same name – has something of a Marie Antoinette problem of its own. While it bills itself as a progressive conference hosted by a think tank “committed to improving the state of the world”, it comes across to the wider public as a giant schmoozefest for establishment elites, a franking of the current world order rather than a challenge to it. One comedian calls it “the money Oscars”. The image of political and business leaders moving seamlessly from worthy pronouncements on inequality to champagne and caviar bumps at one of the many corporate-sponsored cocktail parties doesn’t help. The glitzy backdrop invites a steady stream of cynicism that the event can’t seem to shake. In recent years, political leaders have shunned the Davos party circuit for fear of contamination. It’s not a good look to be seen quaffing vintage wines when your economy back home is turning to mush (the last three meetings have taken place against a backdrop of pandemics, wars and energy price shocks). As the biggest meeting of business and politics globally, Davos is the showpiece event for globalisation and traditionally a target of leftwing protest. But more recently it has also become a bugbear of the right, the global version of Trump’s Washington swamp. Last year, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, the most influential conservative think tank in the US, told a panel discussion that Davos and its well-heeled attendees were essentially “part of the problem”. “It’s laughable that you – or anyone – would dare to describe Davos as protecting liberal democracy,” he said. It is ironic then that this year’s event kicks off on the same day as Trump’s inauguration in the US. Trump’s election triumph in the world’s largest economy and in a country that, more than any other, has driven the globalisation agenda, is a scalding repudiation of globalisation and a check on the Davos consensus. Trump will address the four-day conference via a live video link on Thursday in what organisers say will be a “virtual engagement with participants”. This year’s event was always going to be dominated by the fallout from Trump’s second term. Davos attendees, like most liberals, have a love-hate relationship with Trump: they officially despise him and yet his address will be the hottest ticket in town. “There is a lot of interest to decipher and to understand the policies of the new administration, so it will be an interesting week,” WEF president and chief executive Borge Brende said last week. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi have prioritised Trump’s inauguration over Davos, reflecting Silicon Valley’s embracing of the Maga firebrand. But JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who was apparently communicating with Trump about economic policy during the election campaign and, at one point, was even floated as a possible US treasury secretary – will be there. Other bank chiefs including Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon are also expected while BlackRock is sending a high-level delegation. [ Davos clamps down on gatecrashersOpens in new window ] The annual meeting will attract more than 3,000 business and political leaders, including 900 company chairs and chief executives along with 60 heads of state and government. Official Ireland’s attendance will be lighter than usual because of the busy political schedule at home. While Taoiseach Simon Harris is on the official list of attendees, Wednesday’s Dáil vote will preclude him from attending. Up to 50 top executives are, however, expected to attend the IDA-hosted dinner in the Grischa hotel on Wednesday evening (last year former taoiseach Leo Varadkar sat beside Altman). This year’s Davos convenes under the theme Collaboration for the Intelligent Age, an aspirational notion amid so much political discord and with new technologies increasingly being used to amplify disinformation rather than reasoned debate. The titles of discussion panels at the event will evoke the unsettling new landscape. “Diplomacy amid disorder”; “Russia, what next?” ; “Truth versus myth in elections” and the “Rise of economic nationalism” gives you a flavour. A central question is whether leaders can agree on the root causes of this populist backlash and articulate a credible response.

Title: TikTok goes dark for US users; Trump signals intervention
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-trump-says-save-tiktok-3820071

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the U.S. when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the U.S. will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S." TikTok issued an earlier statement after U.S. users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. Late on Sunday, the app was unavailable for download on U.S. app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in U.S.-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. When asked about the app's restoration and Trump's desire for a deal, China's foreign ministry told a regular news briefing on Monday that it believed companies should "decide independently" about their operations and deals. "TikTok has operated in the U.S. for many years and is deeply loved by American users," ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. "We hope that the U.S. can earnestly listen to the voice of reason and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for firms operating there." TikTok stopped working for U.S. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. U.S. officials had said that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The U.S. has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'HAIR ON FIRE' MOMENT Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S..

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs, one of the most exciting financial markets at the moment, closed out another week with net inflows resulting in three consecutive weeks of gains. In tandem, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also produced an overall positive performance to record their first weekly net inflows in 2025. Following a turbulent end to December 2024, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have launched 2025 on a strong bullish note with significant market inflows reminiscent of their impressive performance in the majority of Q4 2024. According to data from ETF analytics site Farside Investors, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded an aggregate inflow of $1.862 billion in the third trading week of 2025 resulting in a total net flow of $2.42 billion in the new year. Interestingly, this week started on a negative note as these ETFs suffered withdrawals valued at $493.9 million between 13 January – 14 January amidst a Bitcoin flash crash to below $90,000. However, a surge in Bitcoin prices in the remaining three trading days corresponded with a rise in investors’ confidence translating to a cumulative inflow of $2.35 billion during this period. In familiar fashion, BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest net inflows of the week valued at $745.7 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC taking second with investments worth $680.2 million. Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB also registered significant inflows, totaling $216 million and $204.7 million, respectively. Other ETFs such as Invesco’s BTCO, Grayscale’s BTC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, VanEck’s HODL, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC recorded modest net inflows of not more than $40.1 million. Unsurprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflow of the week valued at $87.7 million. Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s BRRR was also another outlier registering zero net flows. At the time of writing, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains its market dominance with $38.41 billion in cumulative net inflow. IBIT also boasts $59.28 billion in net assets accounting for almost half of the total net assets ($120.95 billion) in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market. In addition to the strong performance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $212 million, signaling a return to positive gains after a rocky start to 2025. The BlackRock ETHA emerged as the focal center of these gains, registering $151.3 million in net flows over the week. At the time of writing, the Ethereum Spot ETFs now hold a total net asset of $12.66 billion representing 2.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. On the spot market, Ethereum continues to trade at $3,297, with Bitcoin now valued at $104,837. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores
URL: https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-disappears-from-apple-google-stores/7942155.html

Print TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad." Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S. Reuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada. One of the world's largest wire services, it provides financial news as well as international coverage in over 16 languages to more than 1000 newspapers and 750 broadcasters around the globe.

Title: Is corporate America going Maga?
Donald Trump’s election has accelerated a cultural shift in the nation’s boardrooms

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob Last week Amazon announced plans to release a “behind the scenes” documentary about Melania Trump, produced by the incoming US first lady herself. The tech giant reportedly paid $40mn for the exclusive deal just weeks after it donated $1mn to her husband Donald Trump’s inauguration committee and committed to livestreaming the ceremony on its Prime service. Before November’s presidential election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cancelled plans for The Washington Post, which he owns, to endorse Trump’s Democratic rival. Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event.

Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020.

Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory.

Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory.

Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America.

Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: DoodleBob Be a shame if former DIE board members start jumping from tall buildings. 2 posted on 01/18/2025 8:42:19 PM PST by E.

TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday."The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." Facebook, TikTok apps are seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021. (credit: DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION/FILE PHOTO/REUTERS)It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.A word of warningTikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security.The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action."We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

Title: After Donald Trump’s win, global ETF flows brike record, hitting US$1.5 trillion in 2024

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The 2024 year set another record for global exchange traded funds. Global exchange traded fund flows hit a record US$1.5 trillion ($2.7 trillion) last year with the buying frenzy accelerating after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November. The net inflows obliterated the previous full-year record of $1.2t set in 2021 according to data from Morningstar, which includes most major investment markets except China and India. Total assets hit $13.8t, a rise of $2.7t during the year, and nearly five times the $2.9 billion level of a decade ago. Both equity and fixed income funds saw record inflows, with these two asset classes accounting for 95% of flows between them, despite an industry focus on alternative assets such as bitcoin. The record year is a reflection of the lure of rising markets, with many major equity benchmarks hitting record highs last year. It also highlights the ongoing switch away from the century-old mutual fund format to the lower cost and greater transparency, liquidity and convenience of ETFs. This is particularly true in the US where ETFs also have significant tax advantages. “ETFs are going gangbusters,” said Syl Flood, senior product manager at Morningstar. “Inflation-adjusted returns on short-term bond products, especially for US investors, are back to where they were before rates started rising, so it’s back to Tina [there is no alternative] to equities.” “ETFs seem to have a bit of a halo around them,” Flood added. “People want the ETF version of a strategy, if they can get it. The halo has been earned. ETFs have been great tools for helping investors reach their goals.” Flows peaked at the end of the year with November and December the two biggest months - totalling $310b in the US alone - after Trump’s re-election sparked hopes in some quarters of further stock market gains. “Investors’ ‘risk on’ posture was evident throughout the year and was further amplified by the US presidential election in November,” Flood said. “While markets closed the year with a whimper, ETF flows did not,” said Scott Chronert, global head of ETF research at Citi. “December marked the second-best flow month ever for US-listed ETFs. This was an impressive follow-up to the record-setting flow data we saw in November.” The rise of ETFs was not purely a US phenomenon, however, with net inflows in the rest of the world hitting $377b, according to Morningstar’s figures, comfortably above the previous peak of $292b in 2021, with every major domicile reporting record numbers. “South Korea had a blowout year, growing at a torrid 33% rate for the second straight calendar year,” Flood said. Ireland, Europe’s largest ETF hub, grabbed the lion’s share of these non-US flows, however, at some $226b. The ETF industry also accelerated its transition away from its traditional focus on passive, index-tracking funds in 2024. Assets held by actively managed ETFs topped $1t for the first time, rising 61% during the year, even as US-domiciled active mutual funds continued to bleed money. Net flows more than doubled from 2023’s previous record, hitting $339b. Actively managed ETFs now account for 7.8% of industry assets, up from 6.2% 12 months ago. For once, JPMorgan’s wildly popular $37.1b Equity Premium Income Fund (JEPI) was eclipsed in the active space, with iShares’ US Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) heading the leaderboard with $11.7b of net inflows, taking its total assets to $13.7b. Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at SSGA, who only covers US ETF flows, counted record inflows in no less than 19 categories last year, ranging from growth and small cap ETFs to those focused on derivative income and collateralised loan obligations. In another sense the industry is becoming more concentrated, however. At a time when the US share of global stock market capitalisation has risen to its highest level since the early 1970s, just three ETFs focused on the same index - BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) - accounted for $292bn, 19.5% of the global flows, as they took their combined assets to an unprecedented $2.1t. VOO alone took in an “astounding” $117b, Flood said, a record single-year tally for any ETF, as investors chased the index’s 25% annual gain. The other winner from this trend was S&P Global Ratings, which “dominated flows among benchmark index providers”, with the $475b of net new money subsumed by ETFs that track its indices taking its market share to 28%, up five percentage points in five years. Despite this, Invesco outshone BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA in relative terms, with its assets rising 21% during 2024. The Atlanta house largely piggybacked on enthusiasm for the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, with its QQQ Trust (QQQ) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQM) ETFs proving popular, alongside the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), its own take on the blue-chip index. There were some losers amid the oceans of winners, however. Some niches were out of favour on the fixed income side, including inflation-protected bond funds and emerging market bond ETFs. The latter was tipped into the red by outflows in December “as fears of a more protectionist US fiscal framework led to a stronger dollar and weighed returns”, Bartolini said. In equities, defensive sectors suffered $6.7b of outflows from US-listed ETFs, the second-worst figure ever, he added, led by healthcare, which shipped $7.4b. This pessimism was in complete contrast to the technology sector, where $33b of inflows accounted for 76% of US sector flows in 2024, well above tech’s 37% share of assets, something Bartolini attributed to “broad-based fervour” for artificial intelligence. - The Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Dominating AI and Semiconductor Markets with Record Revenue Growth and Strategic Collaborations

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.

According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors. Additionally, the company’s other AI solutions include PCIe Gen 5.0 switches, which serve as the open, standards-based fabric of choice for AI connectivity. They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities. Overall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

(NYSE:VST) operates as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. It has become the center of attention in the finance world due to AI-related power demand. There are other reasons to invest in the stock as well, including solid fundamentals. As per the report of the third quarter of 2024, net income increased by $1,335 million from the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative positions and the addition of Energy Harbor. In addition, the cash flow from operations was $1,702 million, indicating strong operational cash generation. The company has advanced its efforts in solar energy storage and nuclear by securing two power purchase agreements at new solar facilities, together totaling over 600 MW, with two of the world's leading tech companies – one for 200 MW with Amazon in Texas and one for 405 MW with Microsoft in Illinois. Moreover, the company plans to acquire the entire 15% minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which will make Vistra the sole owner of its highly valuable, carbon-free assets. This acquisition will increase nuclear ownership by 970 MW and solar and energy storage ownership by 200 MW. Overall VST ranks 11th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

He wants an Olympic Park Tourist Trap like Calgary etc. the LA neighborhoods and businesses are gone along with those jobs. kinda adds insult to injury by bringing the olympic torch to a torched area... https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/category/engineering-wildfires/ see the video Winter Fireapocolypse at https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/winter-firepocalypse-90-second-alert/ Cloud patterns directly over the LA fire zone on January 7th and 8th, the days the fires started and accelerated. Alarming satellite captures reveal frequency transmission impacts on aerosol cloud canopies over the LA firestorm zone. “APOCALYPSE: Fire chief warns LA wildfire is worst case scenario” (Fox News). “Weather Whiplash Fueling LA’s Wildfire Could Make It Costliest in History” (Science Alert). For over a decade and a half Geoengineering Watch has warned of the coming firestorms, worse is yet to come. Climate disruption operations must be fully exposed and halted, that effort will take all of us. People are going to do what I did in 1979. Escape the Democrat tyrants. Democrats elected by people with “No skin in the game”. People with kids, that want a good life and freedom for their children would never vote for Modern Democrats. rt 22 m How Wildfire Serves Geoengineering Agenda https://youtu.be/-nmL0aTXXoM?si=5wG6emidUybsgdva The Hawaiian fire area is about 10% rebuilt after 18 months. LA may take 15 years at that rate. Going to miss the Olympics. Elon will have a city on Mars before that. Burn the most pristine real estate in the country (maybe the world) and ruin his career for a “makeover?” WTF Too many st00pits posting these days. \/ do you live in Hawaii ? the reason i ask, is that there was at least 1 fire on Oahu iirc, and 3 or 4 other fires than Lahaina on Maui. and im not sure which one you mean. i dont know about the other fires.

Watched a drone flyover on youtube by Jesse G Wald. He was giving an update. We sit on our deck and watch the plumes of smoke going up in the distance every year. Closest we have come to fire here is having helicopters and planes circling over our house as they make their water drops. If a fire does come our way, we are staying to fight. We have done everything we can it protect the house, but it still needs our help if the big event comes. Do you have working fire hydrants? When we built the house we were required to install a 2500 gal water tank hooked up to a fire hydrant we installed near the house. The hydrant had to have fire dept. hose fittings. Over time we have added an additional 3500 gals of storage, an electric pump with 1” hose fittings, a gas powered pump with 1” hose fittings and 200’ of 1” hose. Things do need to be updated and added to though.

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

Posted on 01/18/2025 12:46:32 PM PST by george76 A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. ... The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. ... Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. ... The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.

More reason to require there only be one Federal Court district for the nation, the one in Texas and reduce the other districts to Small Claims courts Praise God for men like Robby Starbuck! ‘O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock” What a bonkers statement. Blackrock is the largest shareholder in AA because it is the largest provider of index funds. If we were to follow his logic no public company could hire a financial firm that runs index funds because total market index funds invest in every public company. It was never diversity and inclusion - it was always a way to get commie losers, sexual weirdos and other trash into high positions to take down companies like Boeing etc. Trojan horse type stuff under the guise of ‘caring about the less fortunate’ Trump got the highest percentage of minority voters from native Americans...

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A storage facility with boxes and shelves to store records, representing the company's secure records storage. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on storage and information management services. The company’s appeal as an investment is driven by a multitude of contributing factors. Firstly, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $568.1 million, compared with $500 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 13.6%. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13.9% in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased revenue in Global RIM, ALM, and data center. Secondly, the company has launched a new Digital Human Resources (HR) solution to revolutionize HR operations. This may be an attractive opportunity for investors as it aims to revolutionize HR departments by providing secure employee file management in a centralized platform so that both physical and digital documentation is complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with employee records requirements. Moreover, Iron Mountain has released its new InSight Digital Experience Platform (DXP), a secure software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution designed to help organizations handle their physical and digital information. These promising AI-integrated initiatives will revolutionize the system and hold the potential to drive substantial growth in this technologically driven world. Overall IRM ranks 27th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of IRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why TikTok isn’t working for US users anymore
URL: https://www.perthnow.com.au/technology/tiktok/trump-may-give-tiktok-a-90-day-reprieve-c-17433402
Time Published: 2025-01-18T19:58:09Z
Full Content:
TikTok has gone dark in the US ahead of a federal ban on the Chinese-owned short-video app, cutting off access to the platform that has captivated nearly half of all Americans, fueled small businesses and shaped online culture. By 10:50pm on Saturday US Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google’s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a US ban. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” a message on the app said. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,” the message said. Earlier US President-elect Donald Trump said he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office, as the app with 170 million American users buzzed with nervous anticipation ahead of the shutdown. “The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.” Users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible”. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said. In the lead up, TikTok and its aficionados geared up for goodbye. Some on the app filmed themselves frantically scrolling or sharing final secrets with their followers ahead of the ban. Leaders at Oracle, the main cloud computing provider for TikTok’s US operations, told staff to prepare to shut down servers that host US TikTok data as soon as 9pm ET on Saturday (1pm AEDT on Sunday) in advance of ban from Sunday, The Information reported. Without a decision by Biden to formally invoke a 90-day delay in the deadline, companies providing services to TikTok or hosting the app could face enormous financial liability. Experts said Trump could also direct his Justice Department to “deprioritise” or not enforce the law but it is not clear if that will provide enough legal protection to app store owners Apple and Google providing crucial services for TikTok. Trump tried to ban and force the divestment of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by US courts. Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their shares rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire” moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialise to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. with AP

Title: Letters: Sláintecare embeds two-tier system it aimed to eradicate

Nearly half the population still has private health cover. Photo: Stock image/Getty Healthcare Sir — All parties are signed up to implement the Sláintecare plan of 2017. One of its key principles is equitable access to healthcare. OECD research has shown Ireland has one of the most inequitable hospital care systems, and voluntary private health insurance was found to be the largest contributor to that inequity, a fact not referred to in Sláintecare. Róisín Shortall, chair of the Oireachtas committee that developed the plan, said in a radio interview in 2017 that there would be such a good public hospital service after implementation of the plan that only 20pc of the population would need to buy private health insurance. After nearly eight years of the 10-year plan, 47pc of the population continue to have private health insurance. Through the acceptance of funding of private hospital care by private insurance in the Sláintecare plan, all political parties have ensured there will be quicker access to private hospital care and insurers clinics, such as VHI’s 360 Health Centres or Laya’s Health and Wellbeing Clinics, than that afforded to non-insured patients to public hospital care. The two-tier system between private and public hospitals will flourish, as manifested, for example, in the recently announced €500m investment by the Larry Goodman Trust at the Blackrock Health Hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Limerick. I have just retired after 33 years as a hospital consultant and a period in political activism campaigning for a health system that treated patients as patients and not as private or public. I deplore the fact that our political system and its Sláintecare plan will ensure this wealthy country will have embedded in its system in 2025, and for the foreseeable future, inequitable access to hospital care funded by private health insurance. Dr John Barton, Ballymoneen Road, Galway Sir — Colin Murphy’s exploration of the contradictions of Elon Musk was apposite (‘We need to talk about Elon’, January 12). Musk’s vision of free speech is less a democratic ideal than a digital oligarchy, where the loudest voice belongs to the wealthiest player. In this skewed marketplace of ideas, engagement becomes currency, outrage reigns supreme and truth is reduced to collateral damage. What Musk offers is not free speech, but expensive influence, reshaping public discourse in his own image — a cautionary tale of how technology, when wielded by the powerful, can amplify echo chambers rather than challenge them. Governments and democratic institutions must act to safeguard public discourse. Social media platforms should be regulated for transparency and fairness, with algorithms prevented from artificially amplifying individual voices. Limiting monopolistic control and supporting independent journalism are essential to combat misinformation. Global standards for online free speech, coupled with independent oversight, can ensure accountability, while fostering decentralised platforms provides alternatives to profit-driven networks. Together, these measures can help protect democracy from the distortion of digital power and influence. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Sir — The outgoing government promised to enact the Occupied Territories Bill. It seems as though the incoming coalition may decide similarly. The bare-faced theft of Pales­tinian land continues and the Israeli government and its people continue to ignore the International Court of Justice and world opinion. While I would love to see Ireland and other western countries cutting off all commercial and academic ties with all of Israel, certain actions just aren’t practicable I would like the same for relations with Russia and a few others, but we live in an interconnected world and sometimes you deal with people because you have to, not because you want to. Israel may be small in physical extent, but it is powerful militarily and politically. I can easily envisage a situation in which corporate America decides to discourage foreign direct investment in Ireland and in which American companies decide to leave Ireland, all for the sake of supporting Israel. Those advocates urging that bill now becomes law should ask themselves if they are willing to lose their jobs for the sake of this fine move, where no other country will follow us. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Sir – When Bray Bridge Club held one of its main events last week, the winning men’s pair on the night were George Daly and John Hautz. There is great karma in John’s story. The club moved into a beautiful new premises on the same night. It was built as a school in the 1880s. John Hautz recalls it was the first school he attended in — wait for it — 1940. So, 85 years later, John wins in his alma mater. By the way, and contrary to many people’s perception, you don’t need to be of senior years to play bridge. Some of our best are under 30, but it is a game for life. Anyone interested in learning should check out the website cbai.ie. Brendan Martin, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — Emigration to Australia and other English-speaking countries by Irish teachers means the immigrant countries are getting for free teachers trained by Ireland — and they can afford to pay them more. Meanwhile, Irish school authorities are generally hostile to foreign-trained teachers. I have been comparing teacher salaries in Melbourne, where primary teachers are paid from €48,000 to €75,000 in steps over 10 years. Here we have a ridiculous 27-step pay scale (for doing the same job) not found elsewhere. A pensioned teacher earns nearly as much as a novice. It used be there were 32 students for each Irish teacher; it is now 16.5. The average class size here is 23. That’s the same as in Australia but Japan copes with 38 pupils per class. (It was 73 in my first class in Coláiste Mhuire.) I’ve ignored the fact that we have teaching assistants now. We have done away with the primary school examination, so we can no longer measure performance. And it seems we can’t afford the level of kindergarten schooling required. Only social media gives us an indication, and it is awful. To deal with the current problem of teachers emigrating to seek better pay and the prospect of buying their own home, I would like to offer these three suggestions. 1. Start new teachers on the seventh increment of the current pay in selected areas to match Australia. 2. Build or buy homes near schools and make them available to teachers while they are employed there. This would kill commuting and create some interest and competence in teachers in their local history and heritage, now missing. 3. Bring back a performance test for primary school-leavers. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Sir — What is the voting public to make of the shenanigans taking place with the formation of the new government? Do they have no shame? Apparently, government ministers are overworked, so there is a requirement for three extra junior ministers. Pull the other one. The pigs are at the trough. Then we have the jobless Independents setting up a technical group so they can be part of the opposition — even though they have sold their souls by pledging to support the new government. How does that work? It is a mockery. I say they have sold their souls because they will have to support unpopular policies, like the carbon tax and not putting in place a no-fault eviction ban. Do they think they can speak against a policy as part of the opposition and then vote for the legislation in the Dáil? It also means that even though they support the government, they will take opposition speaking time, leaders’ questions and chairs of Oireachtas Committees. In short, it will undermine opposition to the government. It makes a travesty of democracy. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The Regional Independent Group agreed a Programme for Government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and now wishes to sit on the opposition benches at the same time. It’s quite clear that some of said group have never contemplated actually being in govern­ment and have allowed the prospect go completely to their heads. Perhaps someone should explain that it’s like playing a Gaelic football match and during the game some players are permitted to run to the sideline and shout down their own teammates. I fear a five-year episode of Father Ted approaches. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan ​ Sir — As Groucho Marx once said: “These are my principles, and if you don’t like them, well, I have others.” This can now become the official motto of our new government and its Independent members. Amazing how so many alleged red lines become irrelevant when power comes beckoning. And we wonder why only half our citizens vote? Tony O’Gorman, Limerick ​ Sir — If I had run for election for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, I would be asking myself why I hadn’t stood as an Independent, considering a group of nine Independents has bizarrely secured five ministerial jobs, while another has already secured the Ceann Comhairle post. The acro­nym Gubu comes to mind. John McGeady, Blackrock, Co Louth Sir — Independent TD Danny Healy-Rae has pledged to supp­ort the new government. His brother Michael is to become a junior minister. I wonder how they’ll cap that? Eithne MacFadden, Carrigart, Co Donegal ​ Sir — The general election is now history and the next government is ready to go. There are no by-elections on the political horizon, though they have been known to emerge quickly. The election of 2025 is going to be the race for Áras an Uachtaráin. Wayne O’Connor assessed a number of contenders (January 12), but there does not appear to be any contender standing out as a clear favourite yet. In 1990, Dick Spring pulled a rabbit out of the hat when he convinced Mary Robinson to run for Labour after they had had a poor general election showing. A precedent was set, and there could be a lesson in this for all the political leaders. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo ​ Sir — Your editorial that Paschal Donohoe should be given the housing portfolio in the new government would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious (‘Give Paschal Donohoe a shot at solving the housing crisis’, January 12). The bibliophile minister presided over the biggest giveaway budget in the history of the State last October (against the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council), which is fuelling inflation again, not least house prices, which are predicted to increase by 7pc to 10pc again this year, according to estate agents. That’s an additional €35,000 that savers will need to find to purchase just an ordinary home where the median house price in the country now stands at €350,000. With a shortage of plumbers, electricians and carpenters now beginning to emerge from the construction industry, one wonders in what book of traditional economic theory will the Public Expenditure Minister, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform find the answers that your editorial so wishes. The good people of Kerry decided not to elect a Fine Gael TD in the general election. They saw through the spin. When will the rest of the country come to realise that it is the current Government’s neo-liberal housing policies that are making the situation worse, not better? Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry ​ Sir — On January 24, we celebrate the International Day of Education, recognising its vital role in promoting peace and development. As a Muslim woman living in Ireland and a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, I want to highlight that Islam strongly supports education for both men and women. In Islam, education is not just encouraged, it is a fundamental duty. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community embodies these teachings by promoting education worldwide. As we celebrate this day, let’s remember that education is a powerful tool for equality and empowerment. By embracing these values in Ireland and beyond, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Nudrat Jahan Malik, Bettystown, Co Meath Sir — How many more excellent articles, like Eilis O’Hanlon’s last Sunday, and appeals from those concerned about the welfare of mothers and children are required before a proper robust debate takes place, resulting in the provision of choice for mothers and babies? It’s a long time since the late, great Nora Bennis campaigned for mothers in the home and was rebuffed by so-called women’s organisations. How hypocritical it is that we are constantly hearing of the importance of choice, but on this issue, seemingly, it is only heeded when it aligns with the views of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, generously supported by the government. The issue demonstrates the total lack of support for families and family life, leading to so many social problems and, ultimately, to homelessness. Any hope of an awakening to the problems mounting up and the promotion of a stable and content society? Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town ​ Sir — While she may live in a very different world to the vast majority, Kate Middleton has been remarkably plain-spoken about having cancer and all the trauma this entails. It is heartening that she is now in remission. I was also pleased to hear her good news thus expressed without any reference to getting “the all-clear”, which from experience is, I feel, an expression that frequently bestows a false level of expectation on the cancer patient, their family and friends. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny ​ Sir — Sam McBride wrote last week that unionists might one day consider Irish unification, but never our flag, the Tricolour. I suggest a compromise — a new flag consisting of the Tricolour with the red hand of Ulster taking its place in the white band. Perhaps this would be acceptable to both sides. What do your readers think? Bernard Naughton, Farranree, Co Cork ​ Sir — Your columnist Declan Lynch claims no sensible person can love “remorseless” Manchester City. Well, I have been a City supporter for over 50 years and I am a very sensible person. Sour grapes could be the problem — Declan supports Liverpool.

Title: Trump says he may give TikTok a 90-day reprieve on Monday
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/tiktok-shutdown-go-dark-trump-may-give-90-day-reprieve-rednote-4876286

World Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. WASHINGTON: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday (Jan 18) and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the platform used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 0345 GMT (11.45am Singapore time): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would "force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We're working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible". It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. After the court defeat, TikTok CEO Shou Chew appealed to Trump, thanking him for his "commitment to work with us to find a solution". Trump "truly understands our platform", he added. Chew is also set to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday. The law requires Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, blocking new downloads. The companies could face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user who can access the app. Oracle, which hosts TikTok's servers, would also be legally obligated to enforce the ban. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. A last-minute proposal made Saturday by the highly-valued start-up Perplexity AI offered a merger with the US subsidiary of TikTok, a source with knowledge of the deal told AFP. That deal could allow parent company ByteDance a possible solution without selling off the app entirely. The plan, first reported by US broadcaster CNBC, would create a new joint venture combining the assets of US TikTok and Perplexity AI, which has been backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The proposal did not include a price for the transaction, but the source estimated it would be at least US$50 billion. Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, has also made an offer to purchase TikTok's US activity and said he's "ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal". Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary, who is involved in that offer, told Fox News that ByteDance was offered US$20 billion for TikTok's US operation. He acknowledged the legal uncertainty over the case, with it remaining an open question whether an executive order by Trump to halt the ban would override the law. "Congress wrote this law to be virtually president-proof," warned Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress. Sarah Kreps, a professor of government and law at Cornell University, said that "if an executive order conflicts with an existing law, the law takes precedence, and the order can be struck down by the courts". With TikTok forced into a shutdown, its US-based rivals Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could reap benefits. Thousands of worried TikTok users have protectively turned to Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), a Chinese social media network similar to Instagram. Nicknamed "Red Note" by its American users, it was the most downloaded app on the US Apple Store this week.

Toronto By Ian Bickis, The Canadian Press Posted January 18, 2025 9:03 am. Last Updated January 18, 2025 10:04 am. TORONTO — Four of Canada’s biggest banks have left the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance that aims to accelerate climate action among financial institutions. Banks including BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group and CIBC confirmed Friday they were no longer members. The withdrawals from the alliance follow on departures by the six largest banks in the U.S. in recent weeks ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Financial institutions are pulling back following sustained criticism from U.S. Republicans on various climate alliances and the very concept of factoring environmental risks into their business operations. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative earlier this month in a move that led the group to suspend activities and launch a review of the initiative, citing “recent developments in the U.S.” Canadian banks did not cite issues in the U.S. for why they were leaving the alliance, but in statements said they are able to continue with their climate work without the help of the group. BMO spokesman Jeff Roman said the bank is fully committed to its climate strategy and supporting its clients in the transition to net zero. “We have robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements,” he said. National Bank said it left the alliance as it streamlines how it reports on its plans and progress. It said it would have a pragmatic approach and work with companies in all sectors to decarbonize. TD said it has what it needs to advance its strategy and advise its clients as they adapt their businesses. CIBC said the alliance was formed when the global industry was scaling up climate efforts but that the space has evolved enough for it to go it alone. “Having made significant progress alongside our clients in these areas, we are now well-positioned to further this work outside of the formal structure of the NZBA,” said spokesman Tom Wallis. The withdrawal of banks from the alliance shows the need for government to step in, said Greenpeace senior energy strategist Keith Stewart. “To call this a craven act of cowardice on climate would be too kind,” Stewart said in a statement. “It does, however, demonstrate that if we want to avoid more communities being burned or flooded in climate-fuelled disasters by moving big money out of fossil fuels and into climate solutions, then we need governments to regulate banks the same way they do smokestacks and tailpipes.” At a Jan. 7 conference RBC chief executive Dave McKay said the alliance was in flux and questioned whether it was the right mechanism to reduce emissions. The bank was still listed as a member as of early Saturday, as was Scotiabank and credit unions Vancity and Coast Capital. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 18, 2025.

Title: JPMorgan and BlackRock C-suite departure surprises show why succession in finance is extra tricky, experts say

CEO candidate departures at BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase show that finding an exceptional replacement is tough, and keeping good candidates committed is a challenge in itself. The departure announcements of possible CEO successors at both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are the latest reminders that CEO transitions are anything but simple, experts say, especially when it comes to the world’s top finance jobs. Mark Wiedman, BlackRock’s top client-facing executive and a possible successor to CEO Larry Fink, said Wednesday he would voluntarily step away from his role in the spring after a 20-year stint at the firm. On the same day, two JPMorgan executives apparently took their names out of the running to replace the longest serving CEO of a major bank, Jamie Dimon (One is retiring and the other reportedly has no interest in the role.) Both examples prove the difficulty of replacing a longtime leader, and in finance, the transition process is particularly difficult, said Chris Stanley, Moody’s senior director and its banking industry practice lead. A potential CEO candidate needs to have a good grasp of the complexities of the business in any industry. But in finance they also need to be familiar with the increasing regulations imposed on the industry over the last 30 years, said Stanley. And in modern finance, so much specialization is required in operations, finance, sales, and risk, that it’s hard to find a candidate with a strong understanding of each area. “As the bank gets larger, the kind of specialization, or the expertise that's required in those four broad areas, but then individually, in each of the business units of the bank just becomes a really hard thing to to contain in one person,” Stanley told Fortune. On top of the hard skills required for the job, he added that big bank and finance CEOs need to have the charisma to sell a shared vision of the firm’s direction to employees, shareholders, and the board. “In a commodity business like banking, where the margins are so thin, it's a pretty compelling story you have to tell to say, ‘We're going to change what we're doing. We're going to invest over here. This is where we see opportunity,’” he said. To add yet another complicating factor to the mix, top executives are likely on someone’s radar elsewhere. When an employee is identified as a candidate for the CEO job, whether by their company or the media, they may reconsider when other opportunities come knocking, said Larry Hartmann, CEO of global talent advisory firm ZRG Partners. This is especially true if the candidate isn’t confident that they’ll beat out the other contenders. Hartmann, whose firm has helped Subway and the NCAA find their top leaders, said even getting on the shortlist for the top job raises your profile for top recruiters like him. “They’re going to be someone that another organization would value,” Hartmann told Fortune. “They’re kind of referenced in a strong way already by being mentioned in that light.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. O’Connor will decide at a later date whether the beneficiaries suffered harm and whether the airline must pay damages. A spokesperson for BlackRock denied in a statement to Reuters that the company’s emphasis on ESG diminishes the creation of investment value. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” the spokesperson asserted. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” Reuters noted that the ruling may have been the first of its kind since conservatives increased their criticisms of the ESG movement in recent years as pushing left-wing social objectives while distracting from the maximization of returns for investors. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. The entity, which committed major players in the asset management industry to “a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximise long-term value of assets,” entirely ceased operations after the departure of BlackRock, per a Monday report from the New York Post. The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.
