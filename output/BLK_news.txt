Hello, today we aspire to be the topic of the day, since the conference organized by “Proto Thema” and travel.gr at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel will host the Prime Minister, the U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle, Hatzidakis, Papastavrou, Hardalias, the president of SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos, as well as dozens of distinguished Greek and foreign entrepreneurs, scientists, and public figures. Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel, Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos. Today there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga, as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday, especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well, I was told that the relationship soured later, when Tsipras was in the opposition, and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break, especially in politics, and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves, not to the… audience, particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras, with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy, should have expected such clashes, bitterness, and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out, there will be much more, possibly much worse. In that sense, I don’t know whether he did the right thing, because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots,” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore, some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him, hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand, the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad, it’s still publicity, and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most. Meanwhile, Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios, named Stavros Michailidis, appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones, and with a 19-seat capacity, at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft, he replied: “I know, I know, because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP, whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related), read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand, Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement, yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that? I hear that today at noon, after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time,” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp, things have always been worked out around a table, but K. M. avoids dinners. The in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm, and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle, who gives especially elegant gifts, brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging, while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica, but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas, about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador. After meeting the Archbishop, the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense, where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast, toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems. The government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency, Maximos Mansion, and Parliament, where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total, from the Press Office, Protocol, and the Ukrainian Embassy, who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time, which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens, then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours, compared with the initial schedule. Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT, the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words, our money—because, shockingly, the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone, including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years, following the bill on the registry of print and online media, order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting, and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things… A longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who, through Nikos Karachalios, “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had, among other things, an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more? On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This, of course, remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon, as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side, where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares, brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients, and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors, it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast, where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders, but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success. If the column had to place a bet, it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g., a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously, a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know), and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI, FTSE, etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed, with the relevant decision coming in two or three months, as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market, and beyond that, our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.” OTE’s CEO, Kostas Nebis, described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber, which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project, with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project, with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT), of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure, and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023, OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones, and with the completion of the above agreements, OTE will assume the entire project, with the concession period (service period), before the infrastructure is transferred to the State, amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts, Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas, as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country, in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market. As for OTE’s results, what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously, something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications, but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market, but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax,” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally, pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case, OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange, with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end. And since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company, let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically, everything started in early autumn, when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules, photography was forbidden, the meetings were confidential, and the event was not widely publicized. At that time, representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia, made the necessary presentations, and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent, and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion, but even more important is the increase in trading volume, while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern. Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight, this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital, his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles, it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region, Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side, particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI, we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation,” he said, implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes, his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives, at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects. The cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close, marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones, facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels, which, however, do not fully cover the needs of islanders, particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time, freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels, which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route, which had been discussed at times, seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link, there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example, when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season. The trading week began with the General Index at 1,986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week, closing at 2,074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer, when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2,000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets, which were drifting in negative territory, with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight, the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2,074.96 points, while today it traded between 2,057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2,083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million, with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session, followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23), Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2), Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2), TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35), and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC, Alpha Bank, Optima Bank, and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks, ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit, as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35). The Greek company Theon, listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100,000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move, Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400,000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026, Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi. With five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register, TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday, the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos, who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing, as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million, zero debt, and first-half profits of €560,000, TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange, with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs. The Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025, after the €1.65-billion agreement in September, while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome, a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI, which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions, Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider. Seventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today, subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October, the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, the largest subprime auto lender, acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns, then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway. Explore related questions

Title: Tucker to Release Information on Butler Assassination – Here’s Our List of What is Missing

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/14/2025 9:20:13 AM PST by Red Badger Tucker Carlson to announce his findings related to the assassination attempt of President Trump in Butler on Friday night. Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Title: How the Grayscale IPO changes the cost to hold $35 billion crypto ETF shares

Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 13 to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol GRAY. The firm manages approximately $35 billion across more than 40 crypto products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a public company, Grayscale will have to disclose more financials and face shareholder pressure, which could influence future fee decisions and product strategy. The filing does not specify share count or pricing range for the proposed offering. Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor will serve as lead managing bookrunners. Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. The company posted net income of $203.3 million through September 2025 compared with $223.7 million a year earlier. Operating margin reached 65.7% in the recent nine-month period. The firm’s weighted-average management fee declined to 1.39% through September 2025 from 1.67% in the prior-year period, reflecting competitive pressure from lower-cost ETF entrants, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Average assets under management slipped to $30.6 billion from $31.8 billion year-over-year. Full-year 2024 results showed revenue of $506.2 million and net income of $282.1 million, down from $512.7 million and $325 million, respectively, in 2023. The company attributed the decline to reduced management fees, outflows, and distributions. The offering employs a dual-class share structure, giving Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, 10 votes per Class B share compared with one vote per Class A share. DCG will retain approximately 70% of total voting power after the IPO through its Class B holdings, which carry no economic rights. Each Class A share will receive one vote and full economic participation. The structure qualifies Grayscale as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements. The Class B super-voting rights terminate when DCG’s ownership falls below 20% of total shares outstanding. The IPO does not alter the legal structure, custody arrangements, or operations of Grayscale’s existing trusts and ETFs. Fund assets remain held by third-party custodians under separate trust agreements. The company completed a reorganization into a Delaware holding structure earlier in 2025, which it stated would not materially affect trust operations. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase membership interests from existing owners in Grayscale Operating, rather than funding capital expenditures. The transaction converts private ownership stakes into publicly tradable equity without requiring the injection of new capital into fund operations or altering sponsor fee arrangements. Grayscale reserved a portion of IPO shares for eligible investors in its Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) through a directed share program. Participants must have held GBTC or ETHE shares as of Oct. 28 and complete pre-registration by Nov. 24. The program does not guarantee allocations, and shares purchased through it face no lock-up restrictions. The public listing will subject Grayscale to quarterly and annual reporting requirements, providing ETF investors with increased visibility into the sponsor’s financial condition, litigation exposure, and product concentration. The registration statement indicates that future fee decisions and product expansion plans will face scrutiny from public equity holders alongside existing competitive pressure in the ETF market.

Title: 'His people are worried': Trump raises eyebrows after asking CEOs for affordability tips

Nicole Charky-Chami is a senior editor based in Los Angeles, writing and producing breaking news. She teaches journalism courses for UCLA Extension and previously taught at Loyola Marymount University. She has worked with the Los Angeles Times and Times Community News, Maria Shriver, Vertical Networks, attn:, Patch and City News Service. She is a Southern California native and Loyola University Chicago graduate. President Donald Trump asked top CEOs for their solutions on how to navigate affordability for Americans while apparently forecasting an economic boom in the U.S. that he compared to the Reagan and Clinton eras. The president held a private dinner at the White House on Wednesday with several top CEOs from Wall Street and corporate America, including JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, according to The New York Post. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also there. “He spoke a lot about affordability and what we can do from a market perspective to address it,” one CEO told The Post. Although Trump did not refer to it as an "affordability crisis," he did notion to the CEOs that Americans are struggling and that he's looking for help to improve things. "The CEOs didn’t confront Trump on his prediction, which is far higher than most optimistic forecasts, including the 4% growth outlook from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. But privately, many had doubts given the current economic headwinds," The Post reports. Some CEOs told the outlet that even Trump's own economic advisers are skeptical that this growth could happen, voicing their concerns over the 2026 midterm elections after the Democratic governor victories in New Jersey, Virginia and Zohran Mamdani's mayoral election in New York City. “I sure hope the president is right about 6% growth,” another CEO said in an interview with The Post. “But I don’t see how we get there. His people are worried as well particularly about affordability but they won’t tell him. He’s surrounded by a lot of ‘yes men.'” Some of the CEOs suggested opening up the markets for people to put their retirement savings in the stock market. Based on what's happened in the past, this could yield high returns for investors compared to other assets. “Trump is really interested in making sure we have an economy of owners, not renters with all their money in the bank,” another CEO who declined to be named told The Post.

Title: 'Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2025/1114/1544049-irish-rugby-owes-such-admiration-and-respect-to-joe/

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Even six years on from leaving, Joe Schmidt remains intrinsically linked with Irish rugby. It's not just in the professional game that the former Leinster and Ireland coach is keeping his ear to the ground. Like many visiting teams to Dublin, the Wallabies had booked Wanderers RFC on Merrion Road for their training base this week, but when a deluge of rain fell on the city on Wednesday night, a late call was made - at 10.47pm to be exact, according to Schmidt – to try find a new venue. A few calls were made, and the Wallabies were soon able to hold their Thursday morning training session at Blackrock College. "As a Terenure man, that was a really big favour," Schmidt joked. The New Zealander was in wonderful form on Thursday after naming his side for this evening’s Quilter Nations Series meeting with Ireland. Enthusiasm at a press conference can often be painted on, but there was no doubting Schmidt's sincerity as he spoke ahead of what could be his final time coaching a team at the Aviva Stadium. The one downside, he claimed, was that even the late kick-off at the Aviva wouldn't be late enough to allow him get down to Lakelands and watch his adopted club, Terenure, take on their Dublin 6 neighbours St Mary’s College in the All-Ireland League this afternoon. "I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes..." - Tadhg Furlong and James Ryan on Joe Schmidt's lasting legacy in Irish Rugby 🏉 Watch #IREvAUS live on @RTE2 and @RTEplayer this Saturday. ☘️🦘 pic.twitter.com/30mE6RcYB6 Nure got multiple mentions from Schmidt when he spoke to the media on Thursday. They were his local club when he lived in Dublin, while he was a patron for the Terenure Tigers, the club’s team for those with special needs. His son, Tim, played to AIL level with the club, and as coincidence would have it, they are now coached by another famous Kiwi, Carlos Spencer, who Schmidt coached during their time together at the Auckland Blues. With every year that he’s been out of Ireland, his relationship with the country appears to have grown stronger. In his nine years coaching Leinster and Ireland, silverware became the norm. In three seasons as Leinster head coach, he guided the province to two Champions Cup titles, one URC (then Pro12) and a Challenge Cup, before delivering three Six Nations titles, one of which was a Grand Slam, in six years coaching Ireland. That trophy haul made the breakup all the more painful, as Ireland limped out of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Schmidt’s final season, an ending that threatened to damage his hard-earned legacy. But as usual, time has healed many of those wounds. "He's a hell of a coach," Tadhg Furlong told RTÉ Sport this week. "I think Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe and what he did, for not only the team when he was in charge, but some of the systems he put in place, working alongside David Nucifora obviously." Furlong is one of many in this Irish squad for whom Schmidt had a profound impact. Of the matchday squad for this Saturday, eight were given Ireland debuts by Schmidt during his time in charge, while four others in the wider squad came through under the New Zealander. His influence is arguably even stronger in the coaching team. Schmidt brought Andy Farrell in as his assistant in 2016 after he had been let go by England, and his career has gone from strength to strength. Paul O’Connell and Johnny Sexton were two of Schmidt’s key players during his time in charge of Ireland, while Simon Easterby was his long time forwards coach. John Fogarty and Andrew Goodman also both briefly played under him at Leinster. "I grew up in international rugby under Joe and I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes and some of the phrases and sayings, ingrained in us as a team, you're still kind of thinking that way," Furlong added. "Even though he's gone, and he's gone a long time, he still has a lasting effect on not only Irish rugby as a whole, but I think with certain players in the group that have been coached by him still." James Ryan is another of the current Irish frontliners who was given his start under Schmidt, making his Ireland debut against the USA in the summer of 2017 before he had even represented Leinster. "I hadn't played any rugby and I went on that Irish tour. It was my first taste of what it was like at the highest level," Ryan said. "I'd say at that age, I was 20, I just took a huge amount from him. You understand what a proper, committed preparation looks like. "I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said about him before, but the level of prep, the level of detail and understanding of what you need to get across to be ready for the weekend. It was huge and it's definitely something that I learned at that age." When he left the Ireland job in 2019, he initially said he would be retiring from coaching, and spent some time consulting with World Rugby, before he was tempted to help out with the All Blacks as a selector, and when a Covid-19 outbreak derailed the New Zealand squad during their Test series with Ireland in 2022, it was Schmidt who was brought in to lead the team on the week of the first Test. The All Blacks hammered Ireland in that first Test, although Farrell’s side would go on to win the series, before Schmidt got his revenge a year later when he was part of the New Zealand coaching team that once again knocked Ireland out of the World Cup. He got back into head coaching in 2024 when he took on the Wallabies job, a task described this week by the Sydney Morning Herald's Jonathan Drennan as a "bin-fire" after their disastrous World Cup showing the previous year. "Joe said he was going to take a step back from rugby when he left [Ireland] and I wish he did because you just keep coming up against Joe Schmidt," Furlong laughs, as he looked forward to meeting his old coach once again. This will be his second – and last – trip to Dublin as Australia head coach, and considering the green tint on this year’s British and Irish Lions, Schmidt should be plenty familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this Irish side. "I think Joe understands the Irish system pretty well," Ryan says. "He understands us pretty well and I get the sense that he loves coming over here with Australia and trying to take us on. "We've had some big games against them over the years and I know that will be no different this weekend. Both of those went right down to the wire in the last couple of years."

Time Published: 2025-11-14T16:01:09Z

BNB Chain has welcomed a new resident today as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUILD) went live on the platform. The strategic launch, powered by Securitize’s compliant tokenization platform and Wormhole, adds one of the most regulated digital assets to Binance’s thriving financial ecosystem. The strategic move comes as real-world assets see massive traction, with their value up 6% the past month to surpass $36 billion. BUILD’s debut reflects the convergence between blockchain and traditional finance. BlackRock is a leading asset manager and is now bringing its trust, base, and compliance to BNB Chain, a platform known for accessibility, low fees, and high speed. Commenting on today’s arrival, BNB Chain Head of Business Development Sarah Song said: BNB Chain is designed for scalable, low-cost, and secure financial applications, and we’re excited to welcome BUILD to our ecosystem. BUILD is turning real-world assets into programmable financial instruments, enabling entirely new types of investment strategies on-chain. Meanwhile, the development introduces a new share class on Binance’s ecosystem, offering eligible investors access to a tokenized US dollar yield in a blockchain setup. BlackRock’s tokenized asset also secures new utility. Binance will now accept BUILD as collateral. That allows professional traders and institutions to deploy cash smoothly without surrendering exposure to Treasuries-linked RWAs. That use case underscores the broader shift in how on-chain systems integrate real-world assets. These products are maturing from static representations to practical instruments that can function across DeFi and TradFi environments. Securitize, a regulated tokenization firm boasting more than $4 billion in tokenized AUM (assets under management), is powering BlackRock’s expansion into BNB Chain. Securitize handles everything from fund administration to digital transaction agency services. That ensures that clients access enterprise-level RWAs within regulated frameworks. At the same time, BUILD unlocks new use cases that were previously absent for real-world tokenized assets. According to Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo: Expanding BUILD to the BNB Chain and making it available as collateral on the Binance exchange further extends its accessibility and reinforces our mission to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach. BUILD’s launch on BNB Chain comes as on-chain real-world assets see impressive growth. RWAxyz data shows the value of RWAs on public blockchains increased by 5.91% the past 30 days to $36.06 billion. Furthermore, the number of holders surged 10.78% to 537,549, with asset issuers hitting 249. Such figures reflect a flourishing ecosystem of enterprises tokenizing regulated real-world assets. Stablecoins also steadied despite crypto market turmoil, with their value up 0.79% in a month to $299.76 billion. Moreover, stablecoin holders increased by 3.39% in that timeframe to $202.89 million, indicating unwavering demand for digitized financial instruments that guarantee liquidity, compliance, and stability.

Title: THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance
URL: https://acecomments.mu.nu/?post=417303
Time Published: 2025-11-14T16:00:01Z
Full Content:
THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance The cost of auto insurance, for those of us who actually keep our vehicles insured, has increased dramatically in the past few years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (as reported by US News), the cost of car insurance increased by 56% from 2020 to 2025. There are obviously many inputs into the increased cost of insurance, including the obvious one - an increase in the cost of repairs, because vehicles are more expensive and more complicated than ever before. Most news stories will also lazily throw in tariffs or supply chain problems as contributing reasons. But there is another worsening problem that is a major cause of rising auto insurance premiums, and that is uninsured drivers. Coincidentally, the surge in uninsured drivers over recent years neatly coincides with President Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas throwing the border open wide to millions of illegal aliens. Per the Insurance Research Council’s most recent full year data (2023), there has been a huge increase in the number of uninsured drivers. In 2019, 11.6% of drivers lacked automobile liability insurance, but just four years later in 2023 that number had increased to 15.4% of drivers. Another way to state this is that in 2019, one in nine drivers were uninsured, but in 2023 that number had deteriorated to one in six. This data is sourced from insurance claims where an insured driver had to use his Uninsured Motorist Coverage to make a claim, because the party at fault in the wreck did not have insurance. But this also means that wrecks between two uninsured motorists go unnoticed by the Insurance Research Council (“IRC”, as do single car wrecks involving uninsured motorists, since they obviously cannot make an insurance claim. It can be extrapolated then that the percent of uninsured drivers is even higher. Compounding the problem is the growing number of drivers who are underinsured, meaning they have liability insurance at the minimum amount required to register a vehicle and/or obtain a drivers license, but the amount of insurance is woefully insufficient. For instance, Texas’ minimum requirement for liability insurance covers just $25,000 of physical damage per accident, which is less than the replacement cost of most cars on the road, and much less than the average cost of most new cars. In California, the amount is just $15,000. Per the IRC, in the same four-year span of 2019, the number of underinsured motorists increased from 12.2% of drivers to 18.0%. In summary, here is the expensive truth: • More than 33% of accidents involve drivers who are either uninsured or underinsured, meaning they do not have sufficient insurance to pay for the damage they caused. This is up from 23% in just four years. • Therefore, one in three wrecks require the party not at fault to file a claim against his own insurance company, using his “Uninsured Motorist Coverage.” • This also means that those of us obeying the law and properly maintaining our insurance are subsidizing uninsured and underinsured drivers. I have insinuated that the rise in uninsured motorists corresponds closely with the Biden-era influx of illegal aliens. While correlation alone does not prove causation, there is data indicating that the influx of non-citizen drivers has been a major contributor to the rise in uninsured motorists. In a post of mine from September titled “Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc” I documented that Tricolor was a company that sold and financed used cars, and its primary market was Spanish-speaking illegal aliens. It was the 7th largest used car dealer in the country, with a huge market presence in California and Texas. Tricolor went spectacularly bankrupt when President Trump’s crackdown on illegal aliens brought sales to a standstill and widespread defaults on loan repayment. What I didn’t document was Tricolor’s role in putting drivers on the road who weren’t properly insured. The simple truth is that a critical aspect of selling used cars to high-risk drivers is that liability insurance must be obtained to get a vehicle registered, so there is an industry that provides 30-day liability insurance policies to these high-risk drivers. Once the vehicle is registered, it is extremely common for the insurance to lapse after 30 days. The actuarial risk these companies are taking is that the high-risk driver can make it one whole month without causing a wreck before the insurance lapses. Since Tricolor needed its customers insured, albeit briefly, it established its own insurance agency which worked exclusively with “nonstandard” insurance carriers to provide the 30-day policies necessary to sell a car. Per an article from 2019 in Auto Remarketing magazine, “Tricolor Insurance Agency, an affiliate of Tricolor Auto Group, currently serves as an agent for 10 nonstandard carriers and markets its services throughout Tricolor’s 28 dealerships and through its eight Ganas dealerships in southern California.” This article estimated that even in 2019, nonstandard insurance comprised about 30% of the personal auto insurance market. Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. As bad as this all sounds, it gets even worse. Ace of Spades reader “Sabrecav” educated me on just how unsavory the nonstandard insurance racket is. Although their market is customers who are otherwise uninsurable, if a customer with a nonstandard insurance policy gets into a wreck before his policy lapses, the nonstandard insurers are very aggressive about refusing to pay claims. Sabrecav provided me a link to this story as an example: “Crash victims say 'non-standard' auto insurance companies are not fairly compensating them” [ABC7Chicago – 02/18/2025] Drivers must have insurance in Illinois, and non-standard insurance legally covers those who are a high risk or have a bad credit history. But some people who were hit by drivers with non-standard insurance say they are getting lowballed on claims. Debra Smith has been battling the Chicago-based driver's insurance company American Alliance Casualty. It is a non-standard auto insurer. She says the process was slow and she was offered much less than she thought she would get. "They're saying $1,000. That won't be - that's not even the amount of money to get to replace the stuff," Smith said. An estimate from her body shop said repairs could be $5,320. And American Alliance Casualty is saying that it will only cover $805 dollars of its own $1,000 estimate because its only accepting 75% of liability. The Biden-era open-border policy has been costly and destructive to this country in so many ways. One of those is the cost being borne by those of us who maintain auto insurance, because we are paying for the increase in wrecks caused by uninsured illegal aliens.

Supply chain is indeed a real problem and cause. Especially for newer foreign cars, getting replacement parts is hard if not impossible unless you pay inflated prices. Exotics? Fuhgeddaboudit. So the costs of repairs is much higher than they should be. In some cases, the cost would be so high that the insurance company just totals the car and sells off the good parts. Happened to me a few years ago. The car was repairable, but it would have cost so much that the carrier just cut me a big check.

Posted by: Zombie Robbo the Llama Butcher at November 14, 2025 11:13 AM (LxER7) 28 I would add there are many other factors influencing higher insurance costs: 1. Biden inflation. Everything costs more now. Insurance too. 2. Vast number of utterly terrible drivers on the road. Many are immigrants (legal and illegal) from scumbag cultures who drive like drunken retards. But an awful lot of Americans are terrible too, and some older people no longer have adequate faculties and shouldn't be driving. 3. Huge explosion of delivery drivers, delivery trucks, delivery carts, mopeds, e-bikes, etc. Especially in big cities, there are simply more things on the road to hit.

Posted by: Anonymous Rogue in Kalifornistan (ARiK) at November 14, 2025 11:17 AM (QGaXH) 38 This also means that those of us obeying the law and properly maintaining our insurance are subsidizing uninsured and underinsured drivers. Part of the problem could be the cost of cars these days. It was either here or Instapundit that someone recently posted as article stating that the average cost of a new one is now somewhere near $50,000. All the technology and modern safety features make cars a lot more expensive than they otherwise have to be. Wouldn't that make the number of underinsured rise (as carrying the amount of insurance needed to cover these pricier cars pushes up the amount of insurance needed and an increasing share of motorists find it difficult to afford the pricier coverage)?

A beautiful fall day. Its 9am and I was driving safely. Car crosses center line and barrels toward me. Do something, anything, or it's high speed head on! I swerve left and cram the brakes as the car veers to my right. CRASH! Got hit on the right hand side of the front end. If there had been anyone in the front passenger seat, they most likely would have died. My injuries were mostly minor except for the crushed heel. Driver was Mexican, legal but stoned. His passengers were illegal, one dead at the scene and the other got a helicopter ride to Indianapolis. They dropped a LifeFlight chopper on the highway about 5 feet from the perimeter of a secure military base! They had to stop in Bloomington to stabilize the guy before going on to Indy. And as soon as he recovered from his amputation, he skedaddled back to Mexico. Driver was underinsured. Took forever to get any money from that shit. My health insurance and car insurance covered most of my medical bills (surgery and4 months recoup). We never really broke even with what little his insurance paid.

Here “Uninsured Motorist Coverage.” is an option that cost as much as the basic "no fault" insurence.i IF I have insurence then it should not matter what the other driver has unless I wanted to sue him for damages and nobody is getting shit from an illegal alien. Coverage for the vehicle is an option and again it should not matter what the other driver has.

Many are immigrants (legal and illegal) from scumbag cultures who drive like drunken retards. It is certainly the case that when I am the first person stopped at a light, I will wait to see the cross traffic stopping before I pull out even though I know it inconveniences people behind me.

Posted by: Martini Farmer at November 14, 2025 11:18 AM (NwnyJ) 47 As a former state insurance regulator responsible for the financial analysis of property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in a major southern state 'uninsured motorist' coverage is nothing more than a profit maker for your insurance company. Irrespective of the insurance status of someone who damages your car, your insurance company is 100% on the hook for the damage repair of your car per whatever your policy stipulations are. Paying in advance for uninsured motorists is just giving your company margin. Posted by: allmenroder at November 14, 2025 11:19 AM (nUBV4) 48 it's short-sighted that the author implicitly claims that only "nonstandard insurance providers" are "aggressive about refusing to pay claims." some of the largest carriers in the country have been long known for their refusal to pay out when their insured are clearly at fault, and there are no legal avenues outside of woefully inadequate arbitration services for any restitution. several months ago, my brother's car was totaled by a woman running a red light on the feeder. he had been at his own red light and proceeded into the intersection when it turned green; the woman hit him as he was entering the intersection. despite a witness statement and a police report suggesting that their insured's "failure to obey traffic signal" was the sole cause of the accident, the company refused to pay out the claim because their insured was adamant that she had a green light and there was no video evidence to contradict her. that company was Allstate. it is doubtless that the biden-era influx of illegals has exacerbated the problem, but it's far from the root of the issue...we've just turned into a nation of irresponsible liars all looking out for Number One.

So a relatively minor accident that deploys airbags ends up totalling the car because the cost of replacing the airbags alone (which means the trim the bags exploded through also needs to be replaced) is sometimes 10s of thousands of dollars.

Even in our rural Northern AZ County, the local sheriff and city police departments are still significantly under-staffed -- as who in their right mind would want to go into law enforcement when your Chief and/or DA and/or AG will throw you under the bus, and you might end up in prison for daring to do your job as trained a la Derek Chauvin (and risk being murdered once there to boot)?

Posted by: Commissar of plenty and festive little hats at November 14, 2025 11:33 AM (mOYn9) 85 Buck, that was a great article. I read it all. Thank you. I don't think I fully appreciate how much effort goes into some of these posts around here. The pro-government people would probably suggest the solution is to have a years worth of insurance, maybe even raising the minimum amounts. As we saw during the shutdown though, a significant number of people can't afford food. The insurance companies would probably set people up for a year policy with monthly payments. People would pay for the first month, register the vehicle and then let insurance coverage lapse. I have no idea what the solution could be aside from requiring people to have a years worth of insurance paid before the vehicle could be registered. And that won't happen. Since I like to share food prices to let the Horde know what things are like here in Canada, I have a 10 year old Honda with about 80,000 MILES - I did the conversion - and pay about $1300 a year for good coverage.

As I was driving that car home (at dusk) -- after having owned it for no more than 10 minutes, a large deer running across the divided highway (median covered in trees and shrubbery so I didn't see it coming with my usually excellent peripheral vision) crashed into the left front fender. First time I'd ever hit any animal driving, let alone a deer. The front left tire sounded like it was shredding, so stopped and got out the crowbar to pull the crushed fender back off the tire. Anywho, the highly-rated local body shop was so busy they couldn't get me in until over a month later -- and I was able to drive the vehicle with no issues. After they "repaired" it -- it looked brand new -- as I started to drive it out of their lot, it began shaking violently! I took it back and said "What the hell did you do to my car?" and described the issue. They said it was like that when I brought it in -- total bullshit. They said the last thing they did was take it to Big O Tires down the road for an alignment; well, I was good and proper fucked as they'd cracked a head gasket somehow ... so I had to eat that one.

No matter how many accidents or tickets you get, it seems like insurers have to cover you. I know some reckless idiots who had so many points on their license that the state eventually suspended the license. But they had insurance coverage at that time, and again when the suspension period ended. One quite memorable incident involved a guy with a license that was recently unsuspended who drove an exotic car off a bridge. No way this guy should have been driving at all, let alone a $300k car (which was totaled, of course).

In the accident that was my kid's fault, the insurance company lowballed me greatly and I had to fight for an extra $1K (but they still wouldn't fix). In the other, not my kid's fault, insurance gave $3-4K over worth so it didn;t have to fix. Apparently, tariffs and supply chain are making car fixes very expensive and car parts very valuable. Neither accident deployed airbags, so were low speed, single site accidents on the cars (one on the side, one on the back).

Body shops will grossly overestimate the damages to a car in order to declare it a total loss, because their profit margin on a total loss is about 95% for the storage fees, gate fees, cleanup fees, teardown fees, admin fees, estimating fees, etc. The gross profit on a repairable car is maybe 20-25%. So the body shops are driving up a HUGE increase through ridiculous fees for doing nothing. And we all pay for it through out premiums. Posted by: DavesNotHere Caliber Collision does a great job.

It just shouldn't matter, and if we did insurance differently, it wouldn't. The whole reason for "underinsurance" comes down to three things: 1. Cars are expensive 2. Medical care is ruinously expensive 3. I'm in the hook for 1 and 2. But *why* am I on the hook for it? I shouldn't be, and neither should you. I shouldn't have to carry enough insurance to pay for a Mercedes S-Class and six months of hospitalization. I should pay for *me* and vice-versa. Recast driving as an activity generally to be an assumed-risk activity. Barring recklessness (which is its own category, and for which insurance needn't pay anyway), put *all* liability on the motorist and restrict it to *him* and his passengers. If there's a wreck, even through carelessness or negligence, your fault or not, your insurance pays for your property and care, his pays for his. Or you don't have it. No skin off my back. In the event of recklessness or another voiding issue, the insurance company is welcome to go after you for liability (or I am, if I self-insure).

Mine paid out a claim to someone injured in a rollover (the driver of that vehicle was... you guessed it, uninsured) they claimed I caused (the citation against me was thrown out in court). They didn't think I had any real culpability, but it was easier to simply pay the claim than it was to dispute it. The other reasons are, as you say, Buck, the expense of cars (some of it because of just how expensive they have become, but the other part is low-impact bumpers and such, that used to be handled by putting just a new bumper on - now handled by replacing a huge portion of the rear end, it seems) and the un- and underinsured motorists. As far as expense, vast numbers of cars are simply totalled after an accident, now. Posted by: GWB at November 14, 2025 11:52 AM (9tT1a) 145 Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. ++++ Which also doesn't matter. You can't get blood from a stone. So he's "underinsured?" You have no recourse. Sure, you can sue him (or your insurance company can), but what will you get for it? Bupkiss. The only time "underinsurance" presents an actual risk is if you *do* have assets worth defending. If you don't, then insurance doesn't matter at all except for ticking the box to avoid getting arrested. Have adequate insurance? Why bother? It costs more and buys you nothing.

Both of the following are true: 1. Labor is expensive 2. Capital is cheap, especially if you're deep-pocketed corporation who can borrow at hilariously low rates If you artificially make labor expensive, it creates a capital preference for business spending. Insofar as a business *can* shift the ratio to favor capital expenditure, it will. If you artificially make capital cheap (we do), it *also* creates that same capital preference. Boosting the price of labor while capital is cheap just ensures less labor will be used. This is also why capital cost repression (low rates) acts the same as a higher minimum wage... Posted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at November 14, 2025 11:58 AM (6bTRc) 163 In Texas, you are required to purchase auto insurance. That government mandate creates an artificial scarcity, which drives up insurance rates. The thing that gets me, though, is that they still sell uninsured motorist policies, which you need because the high cost encourages people to get around the mandate. As a bonus, the state's attempt to enforce the mandate leads to lots of opportunities for "big brother" to step in, which of course he does. I guess you could say that I'm not a fan.

First place famously orderly, sane, and well-organized (with good drivers). Second mellow, civilized, and uninhabited (well the South Island's pretty empty, so driving was beautiful and relaxing between the few major towns). I wouldn't sweat it (though guessing St Croix might have rougher edges).

The principal that your own Insurance will pay is why your premiums have skyrocketed. Plus Uninsured, Underinsured and decaying cities. Insurance has the principle of Subordination. They will pay your claims. Then they turn around and collect from the other guy’s Insurance. Except, he doesn’t have any. Now what? That’s how “No Fault” and “Uninsured” works. YOU pay for it, one way or another. Always keep in mind, Insurance companies are so hated - almost as much as Lawyers - without much justification. The Politicians have ruined Insurance. Good drivers, good people, make for low premiums. When the State mandates this and that, the costs go up. “You cannot refuse coverage”. At one time, you could not get coverage if you financed a car. What sort of idiot wouldn’t pay cash for a car, and buys on Credit? Bad Risk. Higher incidence of claims. No thank you!

Posted by: Operator Error at November 14, 2025 12:12 PM (92ekx) ++++ It can be. Part of the problem is that even under "no fault" schemes, there is still loads of liability law that makes everything stupendously messy. Driving needs to be fully reclassified and most (or all) of the liability law around it scrapped or it just turns into a shit show that somehow costs even more.

Posted by: DavesNotHere at November 14, 2025 11:21 AM (bUIiy) I recently had dealings with a body shop after hitting a dear with my Silverado. The body shop was a well known long established shop which I have used previously with great satisfaction. Now I wouldn't let them work on a matchbox car. They don't do rust repair. Nobody working there knows how, supposedly. Long lead times for parts. The parts they ordered (Fender, headlight, etc.) wouldn't fit and had to re-order. Then, the body shop tech damaged the truck while driving it into a service bay. ++++ I believe it. There is a huge labor shortage in auto body repair these days. The old timers who actually know how to repair things are retiring (or their bodies are giving out), and kids aren't getting into vocational programs to learn body repair. If you're a competent, qualified auto body technician, you can write your own paychecks, there's such a shortage of labor out there.

They can cancel registrations, and those plates will pop up on every cop's plate scanner. Posted by: CharlieBrown'sDildo The last time I got pulled over, I didn't have proof of insurance in the vehicle because I was borrowing it from my parents and they had all their proof of vehicle insurance on their phones. I still had insurance active on my at-the-time defunct vehicle, because the insurance company didn't offer "garaging" insurance. That the cop didn't give me a ticket for not having proof of insurance leads me to believe that they already have the ability to tell whether a driver has insurance when they run one's ID. ... which I suppose doesn't help when your illegal driver is running around sans ID. Posted by: FeatherBlade at November 14, 2025 01:20 PM (a+4eV) 192 "Compounding the problem is the growing number of drivers who are underinsured" --- IAL and this is one of my primary hobby horses. Your insurance company sells *Under*insured Motorist Coverage, but they don't really push it because they pay out to you under it. I always encourage everyone to check how much Underinsurance Coverage they have--and it is rarely enough. I don't do personal injury law but I did have a few such cases when I was a baby lawyer. In one such, my client was partially disabled by the other driver. She was able to recover all of her and her husband's underinsurance, but it was woefully inadequate. Had they had four times and much, she'd have gotten all of it.

Why can't I take a year or two in that pool? Last year, my daughter was smashed by a car making an illegal turn - grace of God she wasn't hurt; car totaled. Other driver did not speak English and did not have insurance. No arrest, nothing. So although she was 100 percent faultless, prices will go up because *my* insurance company had to pay big.

The Miami-based Securitize, which is planning a public offering, said that BUIDL will be accepted as collateral for trades at the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, describing the asset backed by U.S. Treasuries as a tool for institutional traders. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted last March, and the tokenized money market fund has expanded to eight blockchains since, now including the Binance-backed network that dates back to 2019. “We’re continuing to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach,” co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has around 93 holders, offers a yield. Over the past week, that has averaged 3.7% on an annualized basis, according to crypto data provider RWA.XYZ. Binance’s institutional clients have been asking the exchange for more interest-bearing assets that maintain a stable price, Catherine Chen, head of VIP and institutional at Binance, said in a statement. Chen added that BUIDL was integrated into Ceffu, a Binance-owned custody service, which drew U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny in 2023 over its ability to potentially control assets that belonged to Binance’s U.S. affiliate. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering in 202, was pardoned by President Trump in October. The move has drawn pushback among crypto U.S. Democratic lawmakers. Still, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents the latest sign of how Wall Street firms are embracing the exchange’s services and products. This year, retail brokerage Robinhood, as well as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, have listed BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The coin changed hands around $924 on Friday, representing a 3.4% fall over the past day. The asset hit an all-time high of $1,370 last month, while rising 48% over the past year, but has fallen in recent weeks alongside Bitcoin and most of the market.

Title: BlackRock’s $2.5 billion tokenized money market fund gets boost with Binance tie-up
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/14/blackrocks-2-5-billion-tokenized-money-market-fund-gets-boost-with-binance-tie-up/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T13:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Institutional trading of digital assets is already big business. Now, it’s set to get even bigger as Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Friday that it will now accept collateral in the form of a popular token issued by BlackRock. The token, known as BUIDL, trades at $1 and is backed by a reserve of Treasury bills and other safe, short-term assets. The news of the Binance tie-up is significant because it will likely further increase the popularity of BUIDL, which the world’s largest asset manager launched last year. Since then, its market cap has grown to over $2.5 billion. BUIDL operates much like a stablecoin, and is often used as collateral for trading crypto derivatives. It is available, though, only to large institutional investors, including private equity firms and hedge funds, that invest at least $5 million into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is especially attractive to big investors since, unlike stablecoins like Tether and USDC, it pays out the yield it collects from its reserves. The current yield is roughly around 4%, with BlackRock charging a management fee of 0.2% to 0.5%. To create the token, BlackRock works with a firm called Securitize that specializes in issuing digital assets. In an interview with Fortune, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said BUIDL is attractive to institutional traders because of the yield it pays, but also because it is viewed by exchanges as high value collateral that can allow its holders to borrow more. Domingo also said that tokenized assets are gaining popularity more broadly because they offer a quick and efficient way to settle trades. “In capital markets, every transaction involves updating a ledger. Right now, the ledgers are built on software from the 1970s, and the process is siloed,” said Domingo. In contrast, he noted, blockchains are easy to access and can settle trades almost instantly. As part of its latest push deeper into crypto, BlackRock will also issue a new class of shares of BUIDL on the BNB chain, a blockchain launched by Binance that is today largely decentralized. Binance’s decision to add BUIDL comes at a time when the exchange giant is increasing ties to the traditional financial sector. In a statement, the company’s Head of VIP & Institutional, Catherine Chen, said adding BUIDL came partly in response to customer requests. “Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements,” said Chen. Friday’s BUIDL news comes after other big crypto derivative platforms, including Coinbase-owned Deribit, did the same in recent months. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited 2,310 Bitcoin worth $222 million and 43,240 Ethereum worth around $137 million into Coinbase today. The transfer represents the latest institutional movement involving the two leading crypto assets amid ongoing ETF activity. BlackRock’s recent Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits to Coinbase have sparked speculation about potential selling pressure following ETF outflows. Roughly $867 million exited US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, alongside $260 million withdrawn from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest daily outflow among crypto ETPs.

The group met with investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard during non-deal roadshows last week ahead of the bond issue likely to close by January-end, the sources said, requesting anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to media. Goswami Infratech, PIMCO, Vanguard and BlackRock did not reply to a Reuters email seeking comment. The real estate and civil engineering company is planning to raise around ₹2,500 crore ($2.8 billion) through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue, and is willing to offer a yield of 19.75 per cent, the sources said. The yield being offered on these notes is comparable to what another SP group entity Porteast Investment offered when it raised ₹28,600 crore in the largest ever bond sale for India in May. Talks are at an early stage and no investment commitments have been made so far, the sources added. The funds will be used to refinance its outstanding ₹8,815 crore in high-yield notes maturing in April 2026 and another loan, as well as for other debt-related and corporate purposes. The company has already repaid more than a third of the earlier bond, according to Care Ratings, which maintains a BB-rating on the papers. The new issue will be secured by the SP Group's 9.2 per cent stake in Tata Sons, held via its subsidiary Cyrus Investments.

Title: Lenihan: Ireland need both a win and a performance

There were always going to be changes for the Australia game. The Japan game was going to see the younger players given a chance. It's great to see Mack Hansen back in the side. All of his 27 caps have been on the wing. It's a first opportunity at full-back and I'm really looking forward to seeing him. Paddy McCarthy is starting up front ahead of Andrew Porter. He's only been involved in 10 games for Leinster. He's up against a really experienced operator in Alan Ala'alatoa, whose brother Michael played for Leinster. In the back row, I felt that when Caelan Doris was shifted to number 7 that he'd start there this week. Josh van der Flier has been such an outstanding player in that position but I think Andy (Farrell) is looking for alternatives. Sam Prendergast is back at 10, which was always going to happen. Jack Crowley, I think, is earmarked to play against South Africa but that will depend on what happens tomorrow. Not only do we need a win, we need a performance. I think the fact that Italy beat Australia last week, if anything, puts more pressure on Ireland. South Africa are coming down the line. I think Ireland will win but they have to lift performance. The only thing that makes me nervous is one man - and that's Joe Schmidt. We know what he can do. He's an outstanding coach and he'll want to win this one.

Title: Fear Not: Bitcoin Whale Selling Doesn’t Point To A Crypto Meltdown—Analysts

Bitcoin dropped to $96,000 on heavy selling Friday, and falling risk appetite, leaving traders and analysts parsing whether this is normal profit-taking or a larger turning point for the market. According to on-chain and market reports, the drop wiped out more than $700 million in long positions and left November down by more than 10%. Reports have disclosed that a wallet tied to trader Owen Gunden moved 2,400 Bitcoin — about $237 million — onto the Kraken exchange, a transfer tracked by blockchain watcher Arkham. Based on analysis by Glassnode, long-term holders’ average daily spending rose from over 12,000 BTC per day in early July to roughly 26,000 BTC per day as of this week. OWEN GUNDEN JUST SOLD ANOTHER $290M BTC Owen Gunden just moved all of the remaining BTC out of his accounts. He deposited over HALF of his holdings directly into Kraken, depositing a total of $290.7M of BTC into Kraken. He now has only $250M of Bitcoin remaining. pic.twitter.com/ZUB3aToAgH — Arkham (@arkham) November 13, 2025 That pattern, Glassnode analysts say, looks like orderly distribution by older holders rather than a sudden mass exit. It is being framed as late-cycle profit-taking: regular, steady, and spread out. According to Santiment, Bitcoin has fallen below $100K for the second time this month, triggering a burst of fear and worried posts from retail traders. 📉 Bitcoin has dumped below $100K for the second time this month. Predictably, this has caused a wave of FUD and concerned social media posts from retail traders. As shown below: 🟥: Significant bullish/greedy bias (usually when markets are getting too much FOMO, prices will go… pic.twitter.com/rowUv3xIMd — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 13, 2025 Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research, disclosed that structured selling and steady rotation of gains often show up in late-cycle phases. He cautioned that this phase doesn’t automatically signal a final peak, provided there are still buyers ready to take in the extra supply. Being in a late cycle doesn’t mean the market has hit a ceiling, he pointed out. It just shows momentum has eased, and bigger forces like macro trends and liquidity are now in control, he said. “Rate-cut doubts and recent market weakness have slowed the climb, not ended it,” Liu said. In other words, there’s no meltdown or anything like it. On-chain indicators are being watched closely; Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit ratio stood near 0.476, a level some traders interpret as hinting at short-term lows forming. That reading is only one of several signals, Liu added, and must be tracked alongside liquidity and macro conditions. A closer look at the monthly average spending by long-term holders reveals a clear trend: outflows have climbed from roughly 12.5k BTC/day in early July to 26.5k BTC/day today (30D-SMA). This steady rise reflects increasing distribution pressure from older investor cohorts — a… pic.twitter.com/wECe58CV66 — glassnode (@glassnode) November 13, 2025 The cryptocurrency sell-off came as crypto-related stocks plunged. Broader markets were weak as well, with the Nasdaq down 2% and the S&P 500 off 1.3%. Cipher Mining fell 14%, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 dropped 13%, while MARA Holdings and Bitmine Immersion slid over 10%. Coinbase and Strategy were down about 7%. Based on reports, large institutional flows have pressured prices. Firms including BlackRock, Binance and Wintermute reportedly sold more than $1 billion in Bitcoin, a wave of selling that produced a quick 5% drop inside minutes. Meanwhile, social sentiment turned sharply negative, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit 15, reflecting “extreme fear” among traders.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US regulator mulls guidance for tokenized deposit insurance, stablecoins

Time Published: 2025-11-14T05:57:37Z

Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill said the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of year. The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the regulatory body overseeing banks in the US, is reportedly considering guidance for tokenized deposit insurance and plans to launch an application process for stablecoins by year’s end. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill, who has made bullish statements about tokenization in the past, told the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Fintech Conference on Thursday that the regulator will eventually release guidance around tokenized deposit insurance, according to reports. The FDIC protects depositors in the event of a bank failure and insures money in accounts at banks that are insured by the regulator. “My view for a long time has been that a deposit is a deposit. Moving a deposit from a traditional-finance world to a blockchain or distributed-ledger world shouldn’t change the legal nature of it,” Hill said, as reported by Bloomberg. Regulators and Wall Street have shown serious interest in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector this year. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year, with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one of the most prominent players in the space and launched a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL in 2024. At the same time, Hill reportedly announced the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of 2025 as part of its duties in crafting rules under the GENIUS Act, according to Law360. Related: Tokenization demand is no longer tied to Bitcoin: Galaxy executive He said it’s still too early to know how many institutions will be interested, but the FDIC staff is working on the standards around capital requirements, reserve requirements and risk management for FDIC-regulated stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins have also been a high-growth area, with banks worldwide exploring this technology. The market capitalization of stablecoins is approximately $305 billion as of Friday, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.

Title: Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds as 43-Day U.S. Shutdown Ends, Vitalik Buterin Outlines Scaling Roadmap
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-rebounds-43-day-us-shutdown-ends-vitalik/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T05:00:57Z
Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after the U.S. government ended its historic 43-day shutdown, an event that had weighed heavily on investor confidence across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect ETH price is currently hovering above the $3,400 support zone after a volatile week marked by ETF outflows, declining volume, and intense bearish sentiment. The broader crypto market reacted positively to news of the shutdown’s resolution, helping Ethereum climb 3.18% on the day and outperform Bitcoin with a 3% gain. Analysts now expect ETH to rise toward $3,814 by November 18, representing a potential 10.37% short-term upside. Despite the improved macro backdrop, Ethereum remains in a challenging technical position. Key support lies at $3,333 and $3,300, while resistance at $3,590 and $3,666 will determine whether ETH can break its current downtrend. ETF products continue to show weakness, with all nine Ethereum ETFs recording zero inflows and a combined $107 million in outflows, suggesting institutions remain cautious. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added optimism to the week by outlining a refreshed scaling roadmap and highlighting DeFi’s evolution into a viable global savings tool. He emphasized that the DeFi ecosystem is now “night and day” safer compared to 2020, citing better security audits, stronger protocols, and improved user-fund recovery mechanisms through innovations like the “walkaway test.” Central to Buterin’s roadmap is Ethereum’s ongoing Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling strategy. With rollups, data availability upgrades, and new high-throughput solutions, such as systems already achieving over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin believes Ethereum is on track to support the next wave of DeFi adoption. He urged developers to maintain Ethereum’s core values: openness, censorship resistance, and interoperability. Buterin warned that abandoning these principles risks turning Ethereum into a “walled garden,” undermining the ecosystem’s global mission. A growing bright spot for Ethereum is the explosive expansion of tokenised real-world assets (RWAs). More than $200 billion worth of RWAs now sit on-chain, driven by major institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The BUIDL fund’s tokenised Treasury products, built natively on Ethereum, showcase the network’s rising importance in traditional finance. Institutional RWA assets have surged nearly 2,000% since January 2024, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals even as short-term volatility persists. Related Reading: European Banking Regulator Says EU Crypto Framework Addresses ECB’s Stablecoin Concerns Technically, Ethereum remains in a descending channel from its failed August rally toward $5,000.

While the German chancellor burns taxpayer money in the Amazon jungle to “save” the rainforests, his own advisor, Clemens Fuest, is warning of the return of a planned economy and looming shortages. Meanwhile, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen rallies the climate faithful for yet another harvest season. A Home Game in Belém Last Friday was something of a home game for Chancellor Friedrich Merz. At the climate summit in Belém, Brazil -- which, incidentally, translates as “Bethlehem” and was meant to remind what remains of the local Christian community of the “holy” significance of the gathering -- he found himself among old friends. The media, and only the media, dictate what exists and what doesn’t. And this time, everything revolved around Ursula von der Leyen’s sermon on the state of the world’s climate, cast in simple yet precise apocalyptic tones. Von der Leyen Takes the Stage In Belém, she clearly set the tone -- eager to keep the panic level demanded by climate groups like Fridays for Future as high as humanly possible. Let’s be honest: COP30, like the entire climate club, has already seen its best days. Things ran much smoother when, alongside the EU’s capital pump, the Americans were still flooding the “green economy” with ever-growing rivers of cash. But that party ended with Donald Trump’s election. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are now aligning their ETFs and investment vehicles once again with real economic demand -- that of a world hungry for energy to feed exploding data centers, AI models, autonomous vehicles, and chip production. Not that anyone at COP30, or in Berlin for that matter, seems troubled by such details. New capital sources are being “opened,” CO2 taxes are flowing, and Germany’s many “special funds” are ready to be deployed. Last Exit: The Climate Business Von der Leyen once again illustrated Brussels’ unshakable faith that a state-planned green pseudo-economy represents the final exit from the accelerating economic crisis of our age. By 2030, she wants to triple the global share of renewables and double energy efficiency. What, one wonders, do the Chinese think of that -- as they build new coal plants at record pace? Or the Americans, who just quit the Climate Inc. altogether, opting for a deregulated energy market freed from the green command economy? Von der Leyen, however, invited her audience on a journey to fairyland -- EU-style, dreamy, green-tinted, and disconnected from reality. The Commission President declared, with evident pride, that EU member states now have a “crystal-clear commitment” to reduce CO2 emissions by 90 percent by 2040. Europe, she said, is “on track” -- and now stands ready to “share its experience” with partners around the world. The whole world, von der Leyen insisted, should benefit from the “advantages” (sic!) of the energy transition. For the German delegation -- representing the economically crumbling Vatican of the climate cult -- that must have been the moment when even the long drink froze in hand. The CO2 Business Model No one bends reality into green, molten steel quite like Ursula von der Leyen. A master of turning dysfunction into virtue, she knows that marketing is everything -- and the best marketing for a broken product lies in perpetual apocalypse. Under her spell, even the chancellor couldn’t resist. Merz promptly pledged €6 billion of German taxpayers’ money to “save” the tropical forests. And let’s not kid ourselves: this money will make some climate entrepreneurs and their clans very happy indeed. Which, after all, is the point. The climate economy, in all its tangled branches -- insulation panels, heat pumps, wind turbines planted in forests -- thrives on a moral narrative that translates every act of human life into carbon sin. That’s how taxpayers are blackmailed and the middle class is bled dry. The method requires only a packed travel schedule and omnipresence in the media cycle. The Dream Sequence Reaches Its Climax It all felt a bit like Jack Kerouac’s Book of Dreams: episodes blending the absurd, the half-true, and the utterly fantastical. Von der Leyen reached the peak of her detachment from reality when she turned political. Carbon pricing, she preached, had “proven one of the strongest instruments for climate protection,” effectively shutting down any homefront debate about the collapsing carbon credit system. Nothing may exist that the central planning office brands as heresy. Thus, the recent criticism by the CEOs of BASF and Evonik -- two pillars of German industry -- must be dismissed as “conflicted.” To comfort the mourning congregation of Germany’s shrinking industrial base, Merz proposed a predictable remedy: subsidies and a state-guaranteed “industrial electricity price.” One thing remains constant: higher taxes and levies will, supposedly, keep the global temperature in check. On that point, everyone in the faith agrees. Back to the Climate Vatican During his rainforest pilgrimage, the German delegation emitted roughly 65 tons of CO2 -- not bad for a summit about reducing emissions. (Assuming the chancellor’s Air Force One is airworthy, it still doesn’t run on sunflower oil.) But Merz needn’t travel so far to witness the absurd theater of the CO2 faithful. Back home, the Bundestag is working with Prussian precision to turn the country into one of the most dazzling tragicomic stages of our time. On Thursday, parliament passed the amendment to the Carbon Storage Act -- allowing CO2 to be captured, transported, and stored under the seabed of the North Sea. The technology, known as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), is supposed to help “energy-intensive” sectors like cement, steel, and chemicals -- industries the government blames for the climate crisis in the first place. In plain English: subsidies are now being poured into a brand-new infrastructure that serves an industry which produces nothing. The capital siphoned from the free market through tax privileges and green subsidies will literally be sunk into the sea. That’s East German economics -- wrapped in eco-soundtrack. The End is Nigh We can conclude that the media have succeeded in transmitting the festive mood from Brussels’ central committee back home -- business is running smoothly, apocalypse sells well, and the Amazon provides the perfect backdrop. No piranhas in sight during the boat ride either. But as you know from your own parties, there’s always that one guest who ruins the buzz -- the one who dares to bring up politics or question the narrative. That role now belongs to economist and government advisor Clemens Fuest. He couldn’t resist reminding everyone, in an interview with Bild am Sonntag, that Germany -- after years of stagnation (he politely avoided saying “recession”) -- is heading straight toward shortage economics. That, of course, describes the classic modus vivendi of socialist regimes, where a small, insulated elite allocates resources at will and doles out investments according to political loyalty. Sound familiar? Fuest might want to ask himself where exactly we are in the economic timeline -- and what role the climate circus plays in establishing this very regime he’s warning about. Should enlightenment strike, his ethical duty as a scientist would be clear: to stand on the side of freedom.

Share this article BlackRock clients sold 2,610 Bitcoin valued at approximately $257 million on Thursday, marking another huge outflow from the asset management giant’s crypto holdings. The transaction reflects continued institutional portfolio adjustments as clients reduce their Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has transferred Bitcoin to exchanges in recent sessions to accommodate client redemptions. BlackRock has recorded consecutive days of Bitcoin outflows, with the sales representing client-driven activity rather than the firm’s own trading decisions. The outflows align with broader institutional rebalancing as major asset managers respond to shifting client demand amid market volatility. The $257 million sale adds to a pattern of institutional Bitcoin sales, with other major asset managers like Fidelity and Grayscale also reporting similar client-initiated transactions. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $867 million in net outflows on November 13. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Trump asked CEOs at White House dinner how to tackle affordability — as he predicted US economic boom: sources

President Trump privately polled top CEOs for ideas on how to make US voters’ lives more affordable – even as he predicted a deregulation-driven economic boom on par with the Reagan and Clinton eras, The Post has learned. Trump’s remarks came during a private Wednesday dinner at the White House that included some of Wall Street and corporate America’s biggest names, among them JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon. While he stopped short of specifically mentioning an “affordability crisis” as alleged by Democrats, Trump appeared to concede that parts of the American dream have become out of reach, and asked the CEOs if they had any solutions, according to one CEO in attendance. “He spoke a lot about affordability and what we can do from a market perspective to address it,” the CEO told The Post. Other bigwigs at the dinner included Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman and Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone. Also in attendance were Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump is said to have “controlled the room” of Wall Street and business heavyweights, sprinkling pitches on his pro-growth economic policies with his trademarked charisma and sense of humor. Still, Trump raised eyebrows when he blurted out that he believes his economic policies – which include stiff tariffs on foreign goods — could make the US economy grow “between 5 and 6 percent,” according to an attendee. The CEOs didn’t confront Trump on his prediction, which is far higher than most optimistic forecasts, including the 4% growth outlook from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. But privately, many had doubts given the current economic headwinds. Some in attendance told The Post that even Trump’s economic advisers are skeptical of such growth. Meanwhile, they are concerned about next year’s midterms following the recent Democratic gubernatorial wins and Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York mayor. “I sure hope the president is right about 6% growth,” another CEO told The Post. “But I don’t see how we get there. His people are worried as well particularly about affordability but they won’t tell him. He’s surrounded by a lot of ‘yes men.'” The CEOs also discussed ways to open the markets up to average people so they can put their retirement savings in the stock market, which if history is any guide, provides the highest returns for investors than other assets, according to people who were present. “Trump is really interested in making sure we have an economy of owners, not renters with all their money in the bank,” said another CEO who asked not to be named. Democrats have lately seized on persistent inflation to attack a Trump economic agenda that includes not only tax cuts and deregulation but also tariffs. Trump has claimed the so-called affordability crisis is a “con job” by Democrats, and has attacked Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates to boost home ownership. Trump “has been focused on reversing the economic crisis he inherited from Joe Biden since day one,” according to a White House official who is authorized to speak to the media, adding that the president made time to speak with many of the attendees one-on-one. “The president is always working with business leaders to implement his aggressive, pro-growth agenda to decrease prices, increase wages, drive job growth, and fuel the economy,” the spokesperson added. “This dinner was no exception to his constant partnership with leaders in the private sector.” Trump on Wednesday also weighed in on immigration (US needs skilled workers from overseas through visas), how to address the country’s massive budget deficit (we need to grow the economy to balance the budget) and how Wall Street can help people afford homes and other staples of middle class life. Though the tone of the dinner was festive, the country’s corporate class, many of them Democrats, have often had a fraught relationship with the president over tariffs even if they have embraced other MAGA policies such as deregulation and tax cuts. Trump has publicly called out the likes of Dimon and Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan for “debanking” him, his businesses after he left office in 2021 following his first term, and many right-leaning industries such as gun manufacturing. Officials at both banks blame the debanking of Trump and others on pressure from the Biden administration to cut off ties with right-wing or heterodox industries such as crypto, private prisons and anything associated with firearms.

As reported exclusively by The Post, Moynihan was apparently snubbed by Trump over the banking issues, and his progressive positions on other hot-button cultural issues such as Environmental Social Governance investing and Diversity Equity and Inclusion hiring practices. Moynihan is also chairman of the Brown University Corporation, which held a controversial vote to possibly divest from companies that do business in Israel following pressure from left-wing students and faculty over the country’s military response to the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre of innocent Israelis The vote ultimately failed.

Title: Q&A: Is a Private Market Tokenization Revolution Coming?
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/is-the-private-market-tokenization-revolution-coming-and-when-
Time Published: 2025-11-13T20:05:44Z
Full Content:
PwC’s Roland Kastoun talks about the growth in asset managers’ use of tokenization and what it portends for the future. November 13, 2025 For some time now, “tokenization” has been an emerging buzzword in the private market investment world. Tokenization turns either actual assets or, more commonly, fund shares, into digital units that can be traded and tracked on the blockchain. The purported advantages of tokenizing private market assets include expanded access for retail investors with lower allocations, faster transactions, the “transparent and immutable blockchain ledger,” and a lessened need for intermediaries. (More on this later.) Some asset managers have enthusiastically embraced tokenization. For example, last year, Dan Weiskopf, senior portfolio manager at Tidal Financial Group, predicted that tokenization would replace ETFs as the preferred investment vehicle of choice for financial advisors. Meanwhile, BlackRock partnered with digital asset specialist Securitize to launch BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Ltd., featuring a minimum investment requirement of $100,000. And just this week, Franklin Templeton expanded its Benji Technology Platform, a proprietary blockchain-integrated stack, onto the Canton Blockchain, which is built for institutional finance. According to a recent report on the state of asset management from PwC, the value of tokenized private credit assets rose by 82% between year-end 2024 and October 2025, to $17.9 billion. The value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries was up 114%, to $8.4 billion, while the value of tokenized institutional alternative funds was up 749%, to $2.97 billion. However, even though the pace of growth has been impressive, the absolute volume of tokenized assets remains minuscule in the context of the multi-trillion-dollar alternative asset universe. Moreover, the U.S. currently lacks an established legal framework governing how retail investors can participate in private market investments through tokenization. Related:KKR, Apollo Back Blockchain Infrastructure Platform Corastone “If you look at the values in October of this year, it’s still a drop in the bucket,” said Roland Kastoun, asset and wealth management advisory leader at PwC. “We see it more as starting to slowly migrate from proof of concept to an at-scale technology. And with the advent of stablecoins and the Genius Act, that’s going to help propel it even faster. It’s always hard to predict the exact tipping point in these things, but we see the momentum gathering.” Below, Kastoun discusses this and other topics related to tokenization, as well as how the evolution in the space may impact financial advisors. This Q&A has been edited for length, style and clarity. Related:The Real AI in Wealth Management: Alternative Investments’ Moment WealthManagement.com: Let’s start with the basics. How does tokenization work in private market investing? RK: It can work at two levels. It can work at the fund level, and it can work at the underlying investment level. Depending on which part you are referring to, you can tokenize the actual assets that the fund is investing in, or you can tokenize the ownership of a fund. Now it’s more ownership of funds, but eventually, you could see more real assets being tokenized directly. WM: Is there a reason that right now it’s used more at the fund level? RK: That’s the mechanism in which investors get access to underlying strategies. If you are tokenizing the asset directly today, you have to rethink the entire approach. There’s one extra step of change that has to occur in order to invest directly in a tokenized asset. WM: What are the main advantages for advisors and their clients in using tokenization for private market investment over investing the traditional way? RK: It would allow for faster settlements, and more importantly, it would create a new standard. The idea is not necessarily “Create a fund today.” It’s if the industry adopts that as an approach and settlements can happen instantaneously, it creates a different infrastructure that’s standardized vs. the current setup. Related:Schwab Agrees to Buy Private Share Platform for $660M WM: How familiar and comfortable are financial advisors and wealth managers with how to use tokenization? And what are some educational resources they can turn to? RK: When you look at it today, as end investors get more comfortable investing directly in digital assets, whether it’s cryptocurrencies or other forms of digital assets, that will make them even more comfortable using tokenized funds. So, the education that advisors are going through today to better understand the demands of their end investors around digital assets will form the basis of that overall shift as more and more clients and asset managers move to tokenized funds. Because once you’re used to investing in cryptocurrencies and other types of available digital assets, that makes you much more familiar with the concept and the interface. We were hypothesizing that it will be one of the drivers that will force this adoption. Just like we all started using mobile phones that became smartphones, and we got used to having internet on our phones, and then financial institutions migrated their primary interface from a web portal to a mobile portal, similarly, we see the financial advisors moving toward a more digital asset infrastructure model for their clients. I am presuming that most of them are doing that today anyway to get up to speed on the digital asset ecosystem. That will only accelerate going forward once tokenization takes hold more broadly. WM: Do you have a sense of how much time it might take before tokenization is commonplace in the industry? RK: As a general rule, the tipping point is very hard to predict. I would point you to a couple of things: the general pace of adoption of new technologies is accelerating. So, we think that pivot is probably going to take less time than previous transformations. ETFs took a while, and you may say we are still not completely there, as you think about the assets that exist in mutual funds. Whether it’s going to take two years, five years, 10 years, is going to depend on multiple factors. For example, the increase in retail migration to private markets could accelerate it because it gets harder and harder to manage at-scale private market exposure for retail investors. That will push the providers to different technology solutions to do that. If the markets in Europe and Asia take off, and the Nasdaq follows in the U.S., [that could speed it up]. We have a supportive regulatory environment right now in the U.S. As the Genius Act rolls out and people create more stablecoins and that infrastructure is being built, people will say, “We’ve built it already for this type of use case, let’s expand it.” There are a lot of different reinforcing trends that are happening in parallel. How fast they will take off and how much acceleration will happen across all of them is very hard to predict. It’s not a 50-year time horizon, it’s not a two-year time horizon. That’s a large range, but it could happen within the next three to five years. It could happen within 10 years. WM: What legal framework exists right now for tokenization of private asset funds for retail investors? We heard that has been one of the biggest challenges for wider adoption in our space. RK: That’s something we touch on in our paper. We are seeing the evolution happening in Singapore, in Europe, in the U.K., where there is a move away from that notion that you can only get access to investments because of your wealth band and toward embedding those protections into the actual products themselves. We think that evolution will also happen in the U.S., which would then allow for a more inclusive view of who can access these funds. This is also a broader trend because diversified wealth management firms used to operate in a very segmented way based on wealth bands. But they are seeing that the needs of their investors are necessarily exactly matched to their AUM. So, they are trying to evolve from the rigid system, so that notion of moving beyond wealth bands and specific allocation of who can do what to a different framework that allows for transparency, guardrails and broader investor protection and suitability approaches. It’s quite advanced and advancing aggressively outside the U.S., and we think with the current regulatory regime in the U.S. it would seem also as a positive investment. That’s an issue beyond tokenization. It’s the evolution of the regulatory regime that we think is going to happen. WM: Finally, the PwC talks about the advantages of tokenization in the private market space. What are some of the potential dangers wealth managers have to account for in using tokenized assets or funds? RK: From your own business view, it’s you being disintermediated. If you think of tokenization, now you are creating an infrastructure where 20 people can trade 24/7 and could take their assets much more easily if you truly have interoperability across a harmonized regulatory framework. This new infrastructure creates much easier exchanges, much more instantaneous transactions. How do you, as a wealth advisor, retain your relevance, retail your relationship with your end-investor and continue to educate them and provide them value-add beyond simply access to products? That’s a question they should ask themselves. Today, the role is less and less about asset allocation. There are tools, there are models that do that. They still act as a bit of a gateway to access the end investments. If that role dissipates and you are no longer the key gateway to access the investments, how do you create value for the end investor, in what way do you continue engaging with them, on what topics? By the way, just because you can trade something 24/7 doesn’t mean that you should trade something 24/7. But that’s a different story.

Title: Joe Schmidt back on familiar ground as Wallabies face Ireland in Dublin

Back in the country where he helped to transform Leinster and Ireland into global powers for almost a decade, Joe Schmidt, and his Wallabies squad, appear to have had a restorative week. And a badly needed one too after their 26-19 loss to Italy last Saturday. After the game, which was their 13th Test of the year, Schmidt admitted their performance in Udine had been “flat”, the effects of which also lingered on him. “I take it pretty hard when we lose and I even take it pretty hard when we don’t play to our potential because that’s all we can control,” he said after announcing his team to face Ireland at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 8.10pm). “Because some of these teams are so good, sometimes they’re just better than we are on the day, even though on the day we’ve delivered a good performance. “So yeah, it is tough and you’re emotionally connected to the job. It’s one of those privileges of being so invested in something but it’s also a blight when things don’t go well.” Australia skipped training on Monday to “refresh” the squad before having “a really good day on Wednesday”, Schmidt said, adding: “Our friends at Portmarnock let the boys on for a hit, and they weren’t the only golf club. “There was a couple of them where the boys managed to get themselves out there and Dublin turned on the weather for them,” Schmidt said with a wry smile, at least grateful they’d played in the morning. A sodden pitch at Wanderers RFC also prompted a late change of venue to Blackrock on Thursday. “Wanderers were super to us but Blackrock College, really big appreciation to them for opening up at the last minute. At 10.47pm, we made the decision last night that Wanderers was just too sodden. And Blackrock were very quick to invite us and the training pitch was first-rate. “As a Terenure man, that was a really big favour,” Schmidt added, aware that the big D6W derby between Terenure and St Mary’s – the top two in AIL Division 1A – is taking place at Lakelands Park on Saturday, though he won’t have time to attend. Schmidt also met former Irish team manager Mick Kearney on Wednesday. “We had some of Keith Earls’s coffee; it was real nice. There’s always a little bit of banter, and I’m catching up with Rory Best tomorrow. “My brother [Jamie] lives in Blackrock. My son [Tim] is back living in Churchtown after a few years in Melbourne. I caught up with the family on Tuesday for a bit of dinner. “And that’s part of the balance as well. Family is always a great distraction and opportunity to just be able to step outside the bubble you’re in, which can eat away at you a little bit, and breathe for a few hours.” Schmidt has made six changes to his team for Saturday, with a couple more recalls on the bench, and on balance they look stronger. Carter Gordon, having made an encouraging return after a two-year segue into league, was their fifth different starting 10 of 2025 but succumbed to their outhalf curse by incurring a quad strain. So James O’Connor, called into the squad after a holiday in Morocco and some TV punditry, is restored at outhalf, where he helped steer the Wallabies to their stunning win in Ellis Park. The brilliant Max Jorgensen and Len Ikitau are also restored at fullback and centre, as is tight head Allan Alaalatoa and hard-carrying Rob Valetini, with turnover king Carlo Tizzano back on the bench. [ Too many fans forget Joe Schmidt’s selfless efforts in bringing Wallabies back from brinkOpens in new window ] Noting “some really good glimpses” by Ireland this month, Schmidt added: “Not too many teams play 20 minutes without a player and they’re ahead of the All Blacks even after 60 minutes, because those 20 minutes take it out of you.” In this he cited the effects of suffering two yellow cards against the same opponents. “You lose a bit of fuel in the tank because they’re always going to stretch you at the back end of the game.” Schmidt was always noted for his detailed dissection of the opposition, and his knowledge of the Ireland players ensured he revisited old habits. “Mack [Hansen] has got a really good skill set,” he said. Having gone through pretty much every player (“Jeez, Bundee still packs a punch”), Schmidt concluded: “We’re going to have to be at the very best of our game to be competitive.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: 21Shares launches crypto index ETFs under SEC’s Act 40
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/21shares-first-crypto-index-etfs-launched-sec-1940-act
Time Published: 2025-11-13T18:42:33Z
Full Content:
21Shares’ new crypto index ETFs utilize the stricter 1940 Act framework, marking a shift toward traditional fund oversight for diversified digital asset exposure. Asset manager 21Shares has launched two cryptocurrency index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a structure that could boost investor confidence by subjecting the products to the same disclosure and governance rules that apply to traditional US investment funds. The new products — the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF (TTOP) and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF (TXBC) — were announced on Thursday. Both offer broad exposure to digital assets by tracking FTSE Russell cryptocurrency indexes and holding a basket of the top crypto assets by market capitalization, rather than investing in a single token. Federico Brokate, 21Shares’ global head of business development, said that index funds have enabled investors to gain diversified exposure to traditional assets, particularly stocks. “The same principle applies to crypto investing,” he said. 21Shares has been highly active in the crypto exchange-traded product market and was recently acquired by FalconX for an undisclosed amount. The company will continue to operate independently under the FalconX umbrella. Related: SEC says proof-of-work mining does not constitute securities dealing The Investment Company Act of 1940 is the regulatory framework that governs US mutual funds and most conventional ETFs, imposing requirements around custody and investor protections. This contrasts with the Securities Act of 1933, which is used for grantor trust structures that hold physical commodities — the model regulators have mainly applied to US spot crypto products to date. As Cointelegraph reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already approved a crypto ETP under the ’33 Act — the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, which launched in September. Until now, the SEC has mainly approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) products under the ’33 Act, rather than as fully regulated, investment-company ETFs under the ’40 Act. Demand for crypto ETFs has been high since spot Bitcoin funds debuted in early 2024. BlackRock has led the pack: Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF amassed roughly $70 billion in assets under management within its first year and a half on the market.

Title: XRP Price Jumps as First U.S. Spot ETF Debuts on Nasdaq, Analysts Predict Rally in Weeks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The XRP market just hit a historic milestone as the first U.S. spot XRP ETF, Canary Capital’s XRPC, officially debuts on Nasdaq, sending bullish shockwaves for the XRP price and other assets in the market. The launch gives traditional investors direct exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, and analysts say this could be the spark that propels prices sharply higher in the coming weeks. Nasdaq has certified the Canary Capital XRP ETF for trading under the ticker XRPC, making it the first fully spot-based XRP ETF in the U.S. The fund holds XRP directly and tracks the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate Index, offering a simple, regulated way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure without managing wallets or private keys. The ETF’s approval comes after the fund completed its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, clearing key regulatory hurdles. Other heavyweights, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares, also have XRP ETF applications in the pipeline, signaling a second wave of products that could further deepen liquidity and demand. On-chain data already shows shifting behavior ahead of the launch. Exchange inflows are down, suggesting holders are accumulating rather than selling, even as XRP trades around the $2.39–$2.50 zone and consolidates above support near $2.20–$2.40. Popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is entering the final stages of a major consolidation that could lead to an explosive move within 4–6 weeks. Drawing on historical rallies in 2017 and 2021, he notes that XRP is once again forming a large symmetrical triangle, typically a “compression before expansion” structure. Using Fibonacci projections, Egrag highlights potential long-term targets between $10 and $37, while acknowledging that short-term market sentiment remains cautious. He argues that impatience and emotional selling often precede the biggest upside moves, and that today’s sideways action is more “preparation” than weakness. Institutional narratives are also lining up behind XRP. At Swell 2025, BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein described the XRP Ledger as a scalable rail for trillions of dollars in tokenized assets and cross-border payments, reinforcing XRP’s status as a utility-driven asset rather than a purely speculative token. With the Fed’s December rate decision approaching and risk appetite poised to shift, XRP now sits at the intersection of a powerful trio. Fresh ETF inflows, tightening technical patterns, and growing institutional validation. If these forces align, the XRPC launch may be remembered as the moment XRP’s next major rally truly began.

Title: The most important crypto moments of the year

Time Published: 2025-11-13T17:54:58Z

The most influential crypto events of 2025 included sweeping regulatory moves, ecosystem expansion and the rise of new onchain trends. Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000 in 2025 marked a shift from speculative trading to long-term institutional adoption. Banks and governments began viewing BTC as a strategic reserve asset. The GENIUS Act established a unified US framework for payment stablecoins, mandating 1:1 reserve backing, stricter issuer qualifications and stronger consumer protections. Real-world asset tokenization surpassed $30 billion onchain, driven by tokenized US Treasurys and private credit. Firms such as BlackRock, JPMorgan and Apollo integrated RWAs into DeFi markets. Onchain perpetual futures recorded over $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, with platforms like Hyperliquid achieving speed and depth comparable to centralized exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) crossing the $100,000 threshold this year carried more symbolic weight than speculative excitement. What was once seen as a speculative asset became a structured part of the global financial system. 2025 has turned out to be a year focused less on hype and more on meaningful progress in infrastructure, regulation, institutional investment and technology. This article highlights the most significant cryptocurrency events of the year. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) brought Bitcoin into the portfolios of asset managers, pension funds and corporate treasuries, pushing it beyond retail markets. Daily ETF inflows became a key indicator of market confidence. Unlike previous cycles driven by high-leverage trading, 2025 saw steady interest from professional investors. Banks began conducting Bitcoin transactions on their own balance sheets. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest bank, made its first proprietary Bitcoin trade in January 2025, purchasing 1 million euros worth of BTC as an experiment. Several countries are also exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves, referring to long-term national holdings of the asset. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a permanent asset fund supported by forfeited BTC. The Czech National Bank has also announced that it is considering adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserves. Did you know? Bitcoin mining firms partner with energy producers to stabilize electrical grids and monetize surplus power. In 2025, stablecoins matured from trading instruments into regulated payment and settlement assets. The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025, established the first comprehensive US federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law clarifies that qualifying payment stablecoins are not securities, creates a unified federal licensing and oversight regime for issuers and requires full 1:1 reserve backing with high-quality, highly liquid assets such as cash and short-term US Treasurys. It also mandates regular public disclosures of reserve composition to ensure transparency and consumer protection. Only approved and qualified entities, such as subsidiaries of insured depository institutions, can now issue stablecoins. These issuers must meet strict standards for capital, liquidity and risk management. The act also includes provisions to protect stablecoin holders in the event of issuer insolvency. While the GENIUS Act drew inspiration from earlier proposals, it strengthened safeguards for financial stability. It addressed concerns about a fragmented monetary system by establishing a clearer and more coordinated regulatory framework for digital dollar payments. In 2025, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization transitioned from experimental pilots to institutional mainstream, with onchain value surpassing $30 billion, representing a 300%-400% increase over three years. US Treasurys and private credit are driving institutional adoption. Launched in March 2024, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) brings US Treasurys onchain through tokenization. BUIDL now holds more than $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) across multiple blockchains and distributes daily interest, backed 1:1 by real-world assets. The benefits of RWA tokenization include fractional ownership, 24/7 liquidity and cross-chain interoperability through protocols such as Chainlink CCIP. Institutions like JPMorgan and Apollo are integrating RWAs into decentralized finance (DeFi), further blurring the boundaries between traditional finance and blockchain. Did you know? Tokenized US Treasurys became one of the fastest-growing categories in DeFi, offering low-risk, onchain yields. In October 2025, DeFi perpetual futures surpassed $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, putting platforms like Hyperliquid on par with centralized crypto exchanges. The daily trading volume for decentralized perpetual contracts averaged around $45.7 billion that month, while onchain open interest rose to $16 billion. This increase reflects sustained market positioning rather than short-lived speculative activity. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade in October enabled permissionless market creation through the staking of 500,000 HYPE tokens. The update decentralized listings and encouraged innovation in new asset classes such as equities and RWAs. The platform’s sub-second execution and deep liquidity have further narrowed the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges. This year, Ethereum reinforced its foundational role in the blockchain ecosystem through strategic upgrades and growing institutional adoption. The Pectra upgrade, activated in May, doubled blob capacity, reduced layer-2 fees and improved transaction throughput. It also raised the validator staking cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, enhancing validator efficiency. In July 2025, spot Ether ETFs attracted $12.1 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), highlighting strong institutional demand. Regulatory clarity from US Securities and Exchange Commission rulings positioned Ethereum as compliant infrastructure for DeFi and RWAs, reinforcing its role as Web3’s resilient settlement layer. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December is expected to deliver further PeerDAS optimizations, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term position. Did you know? Corporations are increasingly using private or hybrid Ethereum chains for supply-chain tracking and settlement workflows. Solana’s narrative took a sharply positive turn in 2025. Once criticized for network outages and instability, the network made major strides in reliability and performance. The introduction of Firedancer, a new validator client, enhanced redundancy and processing capacity, reflecting Solana’s focus on large-scale, dependable operations. Institutional and derivatives markets also embraced Solana in 2025. Leading regulated platforms introduced Solana-based futures and options, enabling hedging and arbitrage opportunities that were previously limited to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). This development reinforced Solana’s growing importance in high-volume applications such as onchain trading, gaming and consumer services. The industry faced another reminder in 2025 that security remains a major challenge. With more than $2.17 billion stolen from cryptocurrency services as of Nov. 11, 2025, this year has already proven more devastating than the entirety of 2024 in terms of total losses. A large portion of the stolen funds came from North Korea’s $1.5-billion hack of Bybit. As cryptocurrency becomes more integrated into global finance, security failures now pose systemic risks rather than isolated incidents. The growing sophistication of attackers has mirrored the industry’s own technological progress. In 2025, AI-driven attacks and complex supply chain vulnerabilities led to widespread efforts across the industry to strengthen cybersecurity practices.

Title: Return 'home' to Dublin allowing Schmidt ease pressure
URL: https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2025/1113/1543838-return-home-to-dublin-allowing-schmidt-ease-pressure/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T17:04:42Z

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist For the second November in a row Joe Schmidt has come back to Dublin with his Australian side, and for the second year in a row he's been a man in demand. Having spent a combined nine years as head coach of Leinster and then Ireland, not to mention his earlier days as a player in Mullingar, the New Zealander has laid a few roots in this country. There’s been time this week to grab dinner with some of his family who are still in Ireland; his son, Tim, is living in Churchtown after returning from a few years in Melbourne, while his brother, Jamie, is based in Blackrock. The Wallabies had a day off on Wednesday, and while some of his players braved the elements for golf in Portmarnock, he grabbed a cup of coffee with his former Ireland team manager Mick Kearney, and he’ll squeeze in a catch-up with his former captain Rory Best tomorrow. Far from getting bogged down after a run of five defeats in six games, a few days in Dublin are releasing the pressure valve. "That's part of the balance," he says, ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Ireland at Aviva Stadium. "To go back to your question, how do you cope with pressure? Well, family is always a great kind of distraction and opportunity to just be able to step outside the bubble you're in, which can eat away at you a little bit and breathe for a few hours. "I remember coming back last year and seeing familiar faces, so I guess there's always comfort and familiarity with a lot of the people, as much as anything. "I got out of an Uber in town yesterday morning and I was with our manager Chris Thompson. The first three people walking past, 'Hey Joe, howya Joe?’ "It’s just a really nice feeling, like you're kind of home. So yeah, I'll miss that." Schmidt (above) recently turned 60-years-old, and will vacate his post as Wallabies head coach in July to hand the baton on to his former Ireland assistant Les Kiss. He doesn’t know what the future holds from a coaching perspective, stressing his reason to step away from the Australia job is to spend more time with his family, and in particular his youngest son Luke, who has had a severe form of epilepsy since he was a child. And so, it’s possible that Saturday’s game will be his final as a coach in Dublin, although he has plans to return to the Aviva in a different capacity some day in the future. "Maybe Terenure, but Carlos [Spencer] has got that job, and I’m so old I coached Carlos. No, I won’t be doing that," he laughs. "I've always thought – and I know this may sound bizarre - but I've always thought when we used to go into the [Aviva] stadium and you drive past the Sandymount Hotel, I’ll look at all those people having pints and really enjoying themselves, and I'm feeling like I'm in this sardine can of pressure. "I'll look out there and I think: ‘One day, I'm going to get amongst those people and then I'm going to drift into that stadium and I'm going to enjoy watching a game where I'm not so emotionally hanging off everything that happens'. "I have been looking forward to finishing for a long time and it was a phone call from a mate of mine that had me end up here [with Australia]. I've got to say I really enjoyed it." Of course, there was a time where he wasn't so popular in Dublin, as he recalled his inauspicious start to coaching Leinster in 2010. "I'll never forget my start in Leinster. You talk about losing in Italy [last week] and losing in Treviso in game four [in 2010]. "The experienced Irish boys had just come back in and apparently I had lost the dressing-room and the first question I was asked at the next press conference was, 'Joe, is this the beginning of the end of Leinster Rugby?' I thought that was a little melodramatic!" Even aside from Schmidt’s time coaching some of these Irish players, there will be a strong familiarity between he and the team. He was part of the All Blacks’ coaching team that knocked Ireland out of the World Cup in 2023, before bringing the Wallabies to Dublin this time last year, and running coming up just short, losing 22-19 to Andy Farrell’s side. Only a few months ago, his Wallabies hosted the British and Irish Lions in Australia, losing the series 2-1 Farrell's side which was heavily populated by Irish players and coaches. Since Farrell’s return to his Irish post, Ireland have struggled to click; beaten by New Zealand in Chicago before a clunky performance in their 41-10 win against Japan. But Schmidt isn't buying the suggestion that this Irish side are struggling. "I think there's some really good glimpses. Not too many teams play 20 minutes without a player, and they're ahead of the All Blacks even after 60 minutes, because those 20 minutes take it out of you. "We played a Test recently against the All Blacks and lost a player for 10 minutes and then another player for 10 minutes, and while you might not lose those two 10 minute blocks, you lose a bit of fuel in the tank because they're always going to stretch you at the back end of the game. "So I felt in that game, as a consequence, it made the back end certainly a bit tougher. "I look at some of the guys who've been selected for this game and were selected last week, and there's some very good boys coming through, like young Paddy McCarthy. "It’s disappointing for Joe [McCarthy] that he's not there, but not disappointing for us that he's not there."

Title: ‘Israel Did Not Kill Charlie Kirk. That Is Insane!’: The World According to Hasan Piker
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/features/hasan-piker-interview-charlie-kirk-israel-gal-gadot-1236574930/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Photographs by Dan Doperalski Hasan Piker is about to prove his point. For weeks, the wildly popular Twitch streamer and leftist commentator has been following the online discourse surrounding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The topic is personal for Piker, who was scheduled to debate Kirk at Dartmouth College 15 days after the right-wing political activist was gunned down on a Utah campus. Authorities charged college student Tyler Robinson with the crime, but lately, a civil war has erupted among conservatives over conspiratorial claims that the Mossad had a hand in the murder. “You would be surprised at how many people believe that stuff,” he says as he mulls the menu options at a crowded Chelsea restaurant on a brisk October morning. Related Stories Todd Snider, Singer-Songwriter Who Captivated Americana Music Fans With Bracing Honesty and Wit, Dies at 59 When our waiter arrives, Piker turns to the 20-something hipster. “Can I ask you a question? Who is the most likely person that killed Charlie Kirk?” he asks. “I think it was Israel. It seems like an inside job,” the server replies hesitantly before heading back to the kitchen for Piker’s cold brew. Popular on Variety The answer comes as a shock to me. But it’s no surprise to the extremely online millennial who acknowledges that he is fascinated by conspiracy theories. “I watch every Candace Owens,” Piker says, referring to the new-media star of the far right who has fanned the flames of the Israel theory. He nods in the direction of our waiter: “It’s the reason why I know exactly where he is coming from with the Charlie-Israel thing. For me, no matter how far-fetched the conspiracy is, if it is getting 2 million views in 24 hours, that means a lot of people are tuning in to it. That means a lot of people are paying attention to it. And in this day and age, I think a lot of people are believing it.” Piker feels no allyship with Owens even if they share the belief that Israel is a malignant force. He is merely a student of the attention economy, a space in which he is thriving. With nearly 3 million followers on Twitch and 1.75 million YouTube subscribers, the 34-year-old influencer seems like a possible answer to the question of when the left will find its own Joe Rogan. As the next generation turns more conservative and alpha males like Andrew Tate ascend, Piker offers an alternative vision and the rare ability to sway an election. As an early and enthusiastic supporter of Zohran Mamdani, Piker played a key role in helping catapult the New York mayoral candidate to Gracie Mansion by spreading the Democrat’s socialist message to his legion of fans. With our waiter out of earshot, Piker drops his voice discreetly. “Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. That is insane!” he says. “I did that for you because you were shocked.” When the waiter returns with our order, he tells Piker that he is comping the cold brew. “Wait, why?” Piker asks. “I just like your vibe,” the server says. A lot of people like Piker’s vibe. His brand — a two-fold critique of Israel and the billionaire class — has made him a multimillionaire. And a foil. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has accused him of using his platform to promote “toxic anti-Zionism.” Andrew Cuomo invoked Piker’s name repeatedly along the campaign trail in an effort to smear Mamdani. On this morning, Piker has just arrived via red-eye from his home in Los Angeles for an appearance at the New Yorker Festival; his inclusion in the lineup already sparked a wave of outrage. Wearing a no-logo sweatshirt, sweatpants, a “Free Palestine” wristband and an Apple watch and carrying a small Gucci bag that holds his Zyn supply, Piker signals a cross between conspicuous consumption and Bernie bro. Lurking beneath a camo hat emblazoned with the word “Thieves” is a mind that poses one of the biggest PR threats to the pro-Israel set. The Jersey-born, Istanbul-raised, Rutgers-educated provocateur has no plans to back down. “These last two years, I’ve been called antisemitic. I abhor antisemitism, and I’ve spent my entire professional media career combating it. I just happen to be anti-Israel, and that makes me a far greater threat than the likes of Nick Fuentes because they know he’s a Nazi,” he says, referring to yet another polarizing figure in the ongoing schism within the far right. “I don’t find kinship with the right because I think there are some on the right that just use Israel as a new opportunity to cut through the noise.” His voice, famous from 2,674 livestreams — or 18,624 hours in front of a camera — since he started on Twitch in 2018, is steady and evokes the East Coast liberal arts poli sci education he received. “Maybe they see kinship with me, but I’ve been there for decades,” he says. “Because this is a problem that predates Oct. 7. That’s why a lot of people in the know shortly after Oct. 7, myself included, were like, ‘This is horrifying.’ But the reasons as to why this is happening is because of 75 years of apartheid at that point, the genocide that was the inception of the Israeli nation-state. And most people were just so oblivious to that reality. They were like, ‘How dare you say something so barbaric? How dare you say something instead of just sitting there silently and mourning?’ But there has never been a moment in my life where I ever considered Israel to be anything but a criminal enterprise.” Hanging with Hasan plays out a bit like one of his marathon streams on Twitch, a hybrid of live television and social media that allows creators to interact with fans via chat. The hours float by as he flits from one topic to the next, a mix of politics and pop culture. He’s disgusted by Hollywood’s treatment of pro-Palestinian voices who have lost career opportunities, such as “Scream” actress Melissa Barrera (whose firing from the franchise happened, he says, at “the peak of the panic”). Some have been dropped by their agencies, including Susan Sarandon (“Love her”) by UTA, or their labels, like Roger Waters (“He’s awesome”), over their Israel critiques. More recently, British punk rap duo Bob Vylan was cut by UTA for leading chants of “Death to the IDF” during a performance at Glastonbury Festival. “I don’t think that is necessarily going too far,” Piker says of Bob Vylan’s actions. “I think the moment that you start talking about Jewish control or the Talmud is when people go too far. As a Muslim who sees so much Islamophobia, I’m very tuned in to that dog whistle, like the overemphasis on sharia.” (The notion that Mamdani would impose sharia law on New York was indicative of the tenor of the final stretch of the mayoral race.) “They do it to Jewish people as well in a similar vein. I think that’s when people go too far.” From Piker’s perspective, Amy Schumer should have been canceled for social media posts she made in the wake of Oct. 7. “Amy was going crazy — and no punishments there. She was just straight-up being like, ‘They’re all rapists, barbaric monsters. They’re head choppers. We got to deal with them.’” (Piker appears to be referencing an illustration Schumer shared and then deleted on Instagram that depicted pro-Palestinian supporters holding signs with such slogans as “Gazans rape Jewish girls only in self defense” and “Proud of our rapist martyrs.”) Despite calls for his cancellation for his criticism of Israel, Piker has withstood the heat. “WME didn’t drop me, which I think is very interesting,” he says. He was told to tone it down, but he’s vague about exactly who told him. “‘He’s getting a little too hot’ is what I heard,” he says. Did he heed that warning? “No, because I’m very stubborn, and if something is wrong, I’m going to call it out, and if I can’t call it out, then I can’t do my job. That’s my job. That’s what I do. So yes, I’ve gotten warnings, and I’m not oblivious.” Journalist Taylor Lorenz, a friend of Piker’s who has covered the subject of internet harassment for 15 years, says that he is unique in the breadth of his haters, from Vice President JD Vance to Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres. “Hasan has a very particular strain of politics, which is leftism that is attacked by both mainstream centrist Democrats, bad-faith left-wing actors, the right wing and just internet trolls,” Lorenz says. “And he’s on the most dramatic platform possible, Twitch, which has the most parasocial fan base of any platform. He gets the entire internet weaponized against him. He is the only straight man I’ve ever seen that has been Gamergated.” Earlier this year, Mamdani’s mother, director Mira Nair, signed a petition calling for the Academy to rescind its invitation to Gal Gadot to appear at the Oscars for “her support for Israel’s military actions against Palestinians.” Given that Gadot’s comments throughout the conflict have centered on releasing the hostages, I ask Piker if such a campaign was fair. “I think she should be banned from the Oscars for being a dogshit actress. I think she has no business being there for the crime of what she has done to not only the DC franchise, but really any movie she’s been a part of,” he says of the “Wonder Woman” star. “All jokes aside, Gal Gadot serves an important role in normalizing Israel as not a fascist ethno-state, but instead a place where a lot of beautiful women come from. And those beautiful women happen to serve in the IDF, because there’s also this weird sexualization of the forces as well that takes place, and it plays another role in normalizing Israel and its activities and actions, and whitewashing it.” By contrast, Piker appreciates the work of Natalie Portman, who is Israeli but never served in the IDF like Gadot. “If Gal Gadot could act like Natalie Portman, there’re probably less people yelling at her. Natalie Portman has made statements about Israel that are middle of the road, but ultimately nobody holds that against her. Because she can act her freaking face off, all the way back when she was like a teenager. Oh my God, ‘Léon: The Professional.’” Gadot may have ruined the DC franchise for Piker, but James Gunn is redeeming it. When “Superman” opened on July 11, Piker made viral the idea that the fictional nation of Boravia is a stand-in for Israel. In the film, Boravia, backed by U.S.-made weaponry, drops bombs on and oppresses its desert neighbor, prompting Superman to intercede. Gunn has since denied that the plotline has “anything to do with the Middle East.” “James Gunn is a lot more woke than he lets on. And he lets on how woke he is all the time,” Piker says, still certain of the director and DC chief’s intention all these months later. “Come on, man, you made the [Boravian leader] look like David Ben-Gurion. He just straight-up looks one-to-one like the first prime minister of Israel. We don’t even care what you say about this. We know exactly what we’re looking at.” To take the allegory a step further, Palantir, BlackRock and Raytheon are LuthorCorp. “Lex Luthor is cutting a direct contract with Boravia to extract natural resources and then also have a testing ground for their weapons,” Piker says. “I mean, that’s literally what we do. Gaza is a weapons laboratory. That’s how imperialism works.” Apropos of something, Piker then gives a thumbs-up to the actor who suited up as the latest Man of Steel. “David Corenswet, from what I understand, is Jewish, and he’s very cool. He’s not like pro-Israel or anything like that either, as far as I’ve seen,” he notes. With that, Piker is ready to move on to cross-Burbank superhero rival Marvel. But there’s little for him to mine on that front. “I’ve always been a Marvel fan growing up, but I cannot stand the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” he says. Piker’s intensity is palpable as he chases a double espresso with a 6 mg Zyn pouch. All that’s missing is the scroll of chat comments accompanying his musings. Instead, swooning fans enter the real-life frame to express their gratitude. A woman dining with her son approaches our table. “No, no, it’s impossible. He lives in L.A.,” she says, beaming. “And then I kept looking and looking and … it’s him! I absolutely love your work.” “Being a Twitch streamer is a lot of that,” he says of his exchange with the server. “I have my ear to the ground all the time. A lot of people in legacy media, traditional journalists, are so out of step with the average person around them, even in their immediate vicinity.” Still, Piker allows the rich and powerful to occupy plenty of space in his head. Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor-in-chief of CBS News, gets a bashing. “Bari Weiss is everything that I despise about access journalism brown-nosing to institutionally powerful people and a major advocate for Israel as well. A person that has spent her entire career decrying woke or identity politics while simultaneously using her identity as a shield,” he says. “Like, ‘I’m a lesbian woman. I can’t be intolerant.’ And also even using your identity as a Jewish woman to say, ‘Identity politics sucks unless we’re talking about Jewish people.’” Piker scoffs at the idea that CBS News was biased before Weiss arrived. “There’s not enough pro-Israel voices in major news? Come on. That’s ridiculous,” he says. “Yet she’s been rewarded handsomely for it — $150 million for her shitty Substack that no one cares about or knows about. It’s very obvious why that happened. The Redstones [the seller] and the Ellisons [the buyer] wanted to make CBS more pro-Israel. Shari Redstone was willing to hand off CBS to the Ellisons because she thought they would do a better job of making it more pro-Israel.” (When the Paramount deal was announced in August, Redstone said Ellison “has a clear strategic vision and the resources to take [the studio] to its next stage of growth.”) Since the deal closed, the studio has made a series of moves that bolster Piker’s contention that Paramount is now more Israel-friendly. In September, it denounced a petition signed by celebrities including Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. Last month, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. “Bari Weiss was being packaged as someone who could bring top talent. Wow,” Piker says. “Benjamin Netanyahu never gives interviews anymore to American news? He talks to American news more than he does the Israeli news.” Perhaps it’s Piker’s complete lack of filter that makes him so attractive to his growing fan base. Most influencers with a red-hot career are careful not to bite a Hollywood hand that could feed them. As a result, these aspiring stars tend to punch down. Piker is willing to punch way up. All the way up to Larry Ellison, the second-richest person on the planet, who backed his son David’s successful bid to buy Paramount and also has a stake in TikTok. Piker is trying to explain the craven flip of the once-liberal tech titan to the Republican side. “When Larry Ellison first made that big donation to Marco Rubio [for his presidential run in 2016], people were actually a bit confused. I think he’s gay. Maybe in the closet. I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t laser me down for speculating,” he says with a laugh about the Oracle co-founder. (Larry Ellison has been married to six women and is currently wed to Jolin Zhu.) “But there are [hacked] emails that show Larry Ellison vetted Marco Rubio for fealty to Israel. And as secretary of state, Rubio played a role in the TikTok talks and steered the company towards Ellison.” Piker doesn’t seem too concerned about the prospect of getting “lasered down” by any vengeful oligarch. “I’m also not a stranger to super powerful social media platform-owning billionaires directly hating me and making it a personal vendetta and their life’s mission to destroy me somehow,” he says. In the wake of the Kirk assassination, Elon Musk took to his X to call for Piker’s cancellation, dredging up past comments that walked up to the line. Musk even tagged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (Amazon owns Twitch). Piker notes the irony that he’s not even banned on X, never mind Twitch, because he’s a power user and drives engagement. “A lot of these guys are very thin-skinned, and I think the gravest mistake of my career was when I had [Musk’s ex-partner] Grimes on my show and she talked about how buff I was, and then I talked about how Tesla was shit,” Piker says. “That man has never lived it down.” Grimes wasn’t exaggerating. Piker is hard to miss with his muscular 6-foot-4 frame. He works out one to two hours a day, a regimen that includes playing basketball. If he ingratiated himself better with the oligarchs, he would be courted by mainstream Hollywood. He’s already heard the siren call and turned it down. His manager, former WME agent David Huntzinger, fielded a $1 million offer from one popular betting platform to run a ticker ad during just one stream on election night 2024. Piker said no. “I’m not the easiest client. And not even because I get into trouble,” Piker explains. “I say no all the time to a lot of deals, like a lot of money. And that’s why I really respect David, because throughout our entire professional relationship, he has probably said no to tens of millions of dollars. Starting number was $1 million, which means they could have probably gone up.” He’s happier helping the Mamdanis of the Democratic Party and sticking a thorn in the side of the Cuomo types. “He brought up my name next to Hamas. He said [during a debate with Mamdani], ‘Why don’t you denounce Hamas? Why don’t you denounce Hasan Piker?’” Piker says of the former Democratic governor turned Independent mayoral candidate. “I’m very similar to Zohran in many respects, and the same reasons why they would be resentful of Zohran or fearful of Zohran is the same reason why they despise me.” With the election just 10 days away, Piker is keeping a low profile with the Mamdani campaign. “I’m in a holding pattern right now” he says, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice. “I don’t want to be too prominent in and around the Zohran stuff at the moment because I don’t want them to use it as a line of attack over and over again.” What the Cuomo campaign used was a sound bite of Piker saying, “America deserved 9/11” during a 2019 stream. “I was talking about blowback, a theory that has academic consensus at this point, that our meddling in the affairs of the Middle East has led to the blowback of 9/11,” he explains. “This wasn’t to say 9/11 is good. It’s a horrifying act of terror where 3,000 New Yorkers were slaughtered and even many more with the first responders that tried to save as many people as possible. Yet it was, of course, weaponized against me.” But as election night swung Mamdani’s way, Piker wasn’t keeping a low profile but toasting the millennial mayor-elect with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Brooklyn Paramount victory party. There he offered no mercy for Cuomo. “What happened? I thought the ‘Hasan loves 9/11’ was a successful campaign strategy?” he said in a video that ran on his YouTube channel. “Andrew Cuomo, fuck you. Suck my dick.” Before the Mamdani win becomes a reality, however, Piker can only hope the polls are accurate. But he’s feeling confident as we walk along a busy stretch of 10th Avenue. An older man wearing a bandanna and hoop earrings stops in his tracks and claps as he recognizes Piker. It’s a sign that the streamer’s message about Mamdani and/or Israel is resonating. Then, it hits me that Piker has no security detail as he mingles with the masses. Post-Kirk, that seems unwise. “I make it a point not to have bodyguards when I’m around the people,” he says. “I think it was, was it Fidel Castro or Che Guevara who said, ‘I have a moral vest’?” It was Castro.

Title: The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) Is “Counterfeit Libertarianism”

The American Enterprise Institute (AEI). Framed as a right-wing conservative think tank originally organized in 1938, AEI is yet another political bipartisan NGO with a stated mission to improve American freedom and democrat capitalism via prolonged wars. Thought leaders and scholars are billed as saints and prophets whose words of wisdom must be absorbed without critical question as they guide the US thru an illusion of grandeur. In reality, AEI is a conglomerate of every neoconservative war hawk to walk this earth. At the forefront of their research is the full blown rhetoric of China Bad and Putin is an Antisemite parlayed under the guise that they are Libertarian in their beliefs and motives. And from these very politically motivated two points they define the means of global disruption and nuclear war. Funding includes such sources as Bill Gates, Charles Koch Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, The Carlyle Group, Bradley Foundation, etc. Working in alignment with the coup operatives National Endowment for Democracy and Center For Strategic and International Studies, AEI is simply another cog in the dementia world of coups, regime change, riots, and geoengineered weather wars. While funding planned parenthood, these prophets and scholars assert that intelligence is hereditary, therefore, eugenics is the answer and vaccines are the means. DNA derived bioweapons. In 2003, AEI launched NGO Watch in collaboration with the Federalist Society For Law and Public Policy Studies. The purpose statements claims NGO Watch will provide greater transparency to bring accountability to the NGO sector. It went defunct in 2007 and was relaunched in 2009 with Jewish Zionist Jon Entine as its editor. It goes without saying that NGO Watch was formed by two NGO’s. The wolf watching the chicken coup… (yes I am aware of the spelling). In essence the NGO’s are a composite of neoconservative vs neoliberal with the common goal of micro-managing the White House. It is fair to say that since taking office, President Trump has not leaned on the libertarian policies as outlined in Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. The Project called for elimination of entire federal departments, merit based workers, defunding NIH, flat tax, smaller government, less, less. None of which happened. Heritage president, Kevin Roberts, was recently forced to ‘apologize’ for defending Tucker Carlson’s interview with Nick Fuentes. After a series of resignations from the Heritage Foundation, condemnations from Jewish Republican figures, and a letter of demands from the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, Kevin Roberts apologized for allowing Carlson and Fuentes Free Speech. The Mises Institute, a Libertarian Movement, that holds to the last vestige of pure Libertarianism details the train wreck that became President Trump in his anti-Libertarian principles and policies. President of the Mises Institute, Thomas DiLorenzo, remains pure to the identity and is highly critical of the neoconservatism and military interventionism advocated for by AEI and its CSIS and NED affiliates. There are now over 1.5 million US NGO’s all exclaiming their expert scholarly status whether an adjunct to the right or the left. Unfortunately, outside of Mises, the entity that was Libertarian no longer exists. The ideology has been hijacked by neoconservatives bent on War – in complete contrast to the most basic tenets of Libertarianism, and by the Jewish Money Changers supporting those wars. They wear masks, they carry big sticks, and they wield destruction as the solution to the New Age of the Georgia GuideStones. Every year they congregate at Sea Island, Georgia for their World Forum in private to plan their next attack on a sovereign nation. Today, that attack would be the geoengineering of a severe drought in Iran. Regime change in Venezuela. The genocide of Lebanon by Israel. And giving US tax dollars to grifters such as Zelenskyy and Milei. In 2024, to prove their subservience to the deep state, the AEI World Forum meeting was a roundtable of both Biden Democrats, Obama Democrats, Hillary Democrats, The BlackRock entourage and Bush/Zionist Republicans comprising the Uniparty. The terms ‘conservative’ or ‘right leaning’, no longer direct a reality but instead use the terms to direct an illusion. Trump is not making America Great. He is not a conservative or Libertarian. He is making America a pariah nation triggering constant CHAOS with support from neoconservative and Zionist NGO’s. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: BNY Eyes $1.5T Stablecoin Market With New Reserve Fund for Issuers

BNY, one of the oldest banks in the U.S., is rolling out a new money market fund aimed at helping stablecoin issuers meet federal reserve requirements under U.S. regulations, the firm announced on Thursday. The BNY Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund (BSRXX) is designed to hold cash-equivalent reserves for stablecoins issued under the GENIUS Act, a federal law enacted earlier this year that created a legal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged digital currencies. The fund doesn’t hold any stablecoins itself but acts as a regulated vehicle for backing them. The move comes as stablecoins, a set of cryptocurrencies with prices tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are rapidly growing as a means of payment, with regulations addressing this sector of the broader crypto market being put in place across the globe. The stablecoin market could reach to $1.5 trillion by the end of the decade from its current $300 billion market size, BNY projected. "Cash is the cornerstone of the digital asset ecosystem, enabling global capital markets to move toward an always-on, 24/7 environment," Stephanie Pierce, deputy head of BNY Investments, said in a statement. "Stablecoins are at the forefront of this profound transformation." With the fund, BNY aims to provide a key piece of infrastructure for stablecoin issuers to maintain the value of the tokens. Global asset manager BlackRock, for example, launched the Circle Reserve Fund, which manages $66 billion of U.S. Treasuries and repos serving as reserve for the USDC stablecoin. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered U.S. crypto bank, provided the fund’s initial investment. "This fund represents the infrastructure needed to make compliant stablecoin issuance possible at scale," said Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley in a statement. The fund is open to qualified institutional investors, including those acting in custodial, brokerage or fiduciary roles. BNY says the move is part of a broader push to support the growing overlap between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets.

The company simultaneously announced Circle Partner Stablecoins, a program supporting select regional stablecoin deployments on Arc, creating a unified infrastructure stack for global FX activity, according to a press release shared with Decrypt. The dual offerings is built on Arc’s Layer-1 blockchain, whose public testnet went live last month with over 100 participants, including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, BNY, State Street, ICE, AWS, Cloudflare, Mastercard, Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, and others. The initiative targets inefficiencies in the foreign exchange market, which still operates on fragmented venues, prefunded accounts, and T+1 settlement cycles. T+1 settlement means when you trade an asset, the actual transfer of money and ownership happens the next business day, not immediately. By combining Arc's programmable settlement infrastructure with stablecoin-powered trading, Circle seeks to enable real-time cross-border currency exchange with reduced counterparty risk and capital requirements. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” Circle Chief Product and Technology Officer Nikhil Chandhok said in the press release. The announcement follows Circle's strong third-quarter performance, with the company reporting $740 million in revenue and reserve income, surpassing analyst forecasts by 66% year over year. USDC’s market capitalization has risen from $61 billion at Circle’s June IPO to over $76 billion, according to CoinGecko, still trailing Tether’s USDT, which tops $184 billion. StableFX operates through a request-for-quote execution model connecting institutions with multiple liquidity providers, offering competitive pricing with low slippage. The platform features on-chain settlement, where both payment and delivery occur simultaneously, eliminating the risk that one party fails to deliver funds after receiving the counterparty's currency. The all-to-all model removes the need for bilateral agreements with multiple counterparties. Currently live on Arc testnet, StableFX is available for approved institutions that have completed Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering verification ahead of Arc's planned 2026 mainnet launch. Arc uses USDC for transaction fees, features sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy configurations designed for institutional compliance requirements. During the testnet launch, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has shown “remarkable early momentum,” with the firm noting in its Q3 report that it’s exploring the possibility of a native Arc token. Circle Partner Stablecoins targets non-USD-pegged stablecoin issuers meeting technical, operational, and reserve management standards. Initial participants include Avenia (Brazilian real), Forte (Australian dollar), JYPC (Japanese yen), Juno (Mexican peso), BDACS (South Korean won), Stablecorp (Canadian dollar), Luno (South African rand), and Coins.ph (Philippine peso). These stablecoins gain integration into Circle's Payments Network and StableFX, expanding utility beyond domestic markets.

Circle is seeking to improve FX market infrastructure by offering institutions deeper global liquidity access with fewer intermediaries and reduced counterparty risk. Circle is expanding into the foreign-exchange market, positioning stablecoins as a tool to modernize one of traditional finance’s most entrenched systems. The issuer of USDC (USDC) on Thursday unveiled Circle StableFX, an institutional onchain FX platform built on Arc1, the company’s forthcoming layer-1 blockchain, according to a news release shared with Cointelegraph. Circle also introduced Circle Partner Stablecoins, a program designed to support regulated regional stablecoins. Trading in the global FX market reached $9.6 trillion per day in April, up 28% from 2022, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The daily trading volume in the global FX market is more than double all global stock markets combined, and far exceeds the roughly $1.69 trillion in average daily US equities trading, running 24 hours a day, five days a week, across every major financial center, according to World Bank data shared by Trading Economics. The new FX engine aims to allow compliant institutions access to stablecoin currency pairs with 24/7 onchain settlement at competitive rates and lower counterparty risk. It also aims to enhance efficiency in FX markets by eliminating the need for multiple counterparties and facilitating faster access to global liquidity. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” said Circle chief product and technology officer, Nikhil Chandhok. Institutions will need to complete comprehensive Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verification to use the “compliance-centric trading environment,” the release said. Circle StableFX has launched on the Arc Testnet, offering developers and institutions the opportunity to explore the solution. The alpha version is scheduled to roll out for approved developers and institutions alongside the Arc mainnet launch in 2026.

The move into the FX markets may bring a significant new revenue stream for the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin. Circle’s revenue surged to $740 million in the third quarter of the year, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. The stablecoin issuer launched its Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies.

A 28-year old man has been charged in connection with the seizure of €620,000 worth of cannabis at Shannon airport yesterday. Sean Grehan, of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin, appeared before Gort District Court this morning. Garda Kevin Molloy told the court he arrested Mr Grehan at 6.10pm yesterday and at 6.20pm charged him with two drugs offences. He said Mr Grehan made no reply. Solicitor Olivia Lynch told Judge Alec Gabbett that there would be no application for bail today but a bail application would be made on behalf of Mr Grehan on his next appearance in court. Mr Grehan is charged with having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 at Shannon airport on 12 November. Mr Grehan is also charged with having in his possession cannabis contrary to Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Ms Lynch asked for a short remand in custody to allow the application for bail to be made at Mr Grehan's next court appearance. Judge Gabbett said that he could hear the bail application at Ennis District Court tomorrow. Ms Lynch said that she has been in contact with Mr Grehan’s solicitor, Patricia Camilon at KOD Lyons in Dublin, who will make the bail application on Mr Grehan’s behalf at the next court. She asked that she be granted legal aid for today's court appearance after Mr Grehan confirmed to the court that he does not work. Judge Gabbett granted legal aid. Judge Gabbett said that he would remand Mr Grehan in custody to Castlerea prison to appear at Ennis District Court for DPP directions and a bail application. Judge Gabbett asked are there any issues relating to Mr Grehan that prison authorities should know about such as any medical attention required and Ms Lynch replied "no, he is all good". © RTÉ 2025.
