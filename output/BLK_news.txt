Title: Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now for 100x — Larry Fink’s $700K Bitcoin Prediction

BlackRock, one of the biggest investment companies in the world, has given crypto enthusiasts a new reason to be excited. Its CEO, Larry Fink, has said that Bitcoin can be expected to make huge price moves, potentially reaching the $700K mark soon. The BlackRock CEO explained how political and economic instability is acting as a catalyst for Bitcoin, which serves as an internationally recognized currency free from any local fears. What’s more, Bitcoin is still holding steady above $104K, with a 12% uptick in the last month. With all the signs looking positive for BTC, and keeping in mind that the overall crypto market follows Bitcoin’s footprints, now is one of the best times to be a crypto investor. To help you out, here are 5 crypto presales that can offer up to a 100x return. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has undoubtedly been one of the best crypto presale performances to date. Launched just over a month ago, $WEPE’s presale has already raised over $57.5M, with both retailers and whales gobbling it up at a breakneck pace. The presale ends in 24 days, so this could be your last chance to grab one of the best meme coins. What makes Wall Street Pepe stand out is its personal vendetta against crypto whales, who have been abusing insider information to manipulate the crypto market and feast on innocent retailers. The project aims to eliminate this lopsidedness by creating a frog army of retail investors and providing them with unique market insights, trading strategies, and real-time alpha calls. If you, too, want to beat the market and become a profitable crypto investor, join the $WEPE army for just $0.0003665 per token. For more, here’s how to buy $WEPE. Solaxy ($SOLX) has been created to unlock the full potential of Solana, which currently struggles with issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy has set aside a healthy 30% of its total token supply to resolve these issues. After raising $350K in the first 24 hours, the $SOLX presale is still going strong, with the total presale purse reaching over $13M. Don’t miss out on one of the next 100x meme coins, and get some for only $0.001612 each. Here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-sovereign AI agent with the ability to adapt and form his own opinions, as well as drive conversations and trends on dApps and online platforms such as X. $MIND uses hive-mind analysis to identify market trends before anybody else. He’ll then share his insights and access to new investment opportunities on his X and Telegram channels, giving token holders a real edge in the market. You can grab the best AI agent coin for just $0.0031762 if you get in now — here’s how to buy $MIND. Prices increase in the next 11 hours, so interested investors should hurry up. $RXS is the native currency of Rexas Finance, an interesting crypto project that’s tokenizing real-world assets, such as real estate, gold, art, and commodities. The biggest benefit of this platform is that it simplifies investments. Investing in gold and other precious metals, for instance, will no longer be difficult and will involve just a few clicks. Plus, token holders will get to participate in fractional ownership. For example, let’s say there’s a massive mansion spread across multiple acres of land, and you don’t have enough funds to buy it all by yourself. In that case, you can use Rexas to own a fraction of the property for a fraction of the price. Speaking of $RXS’s presale, it’s coming to an end, meaning prices aren’t as low as they were, say, a couple of months ago. However, they’re still the lowest you’ll ever get them for. Each token is priced at $0.200, with the total presale funding at $43M so far. Out of the 500,000,000 total token supply, 434,925,318 have already been sold. $LHUNT is the official token of the LuckHunter online casino. The platform itself is like any other: you can play casino games, bet, and win. However, what makes it unique is it lets you create a metaverse of your own digital casinos that you can rent. These casinos will be based in different cities, Las Vexus and Utlantic City (modeled after the real Las Vegas and Atlantic City), and you can lease the tables at your virtual casino for short-term or long-term profits. You can also customize the tables and ambiance and create your own gaming rules. What’s more, you can even host VIP events involving high-stakes games and special tournaments to earn luxurious rewards. 1 $LHUNT is currently available for $0.00138, but the price will increase by 10.5% as it enters the next stage of presale in just a couple of hours from now. Having already raised $1.1M in its ongoing presale, $LHUNT’s official website mentions that its potential listing price will be $0.005, which is more than 260% of the current price. While there’s little doubt that the above-mentioned crypto presales can go to the moon in 2025, it’s important to mix caution with chaos and only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. There will be ups and downs, so make sure you do enough cardio to prepare your heart! Also, none of the above is financial advice, and we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before investing.

Title: USDC supply hits $2B – Are investors being cautious around Bitcoin?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/usdc-supply-hits-2b-are-investors-being-cautious-around-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T16:00:11Z

Investor risk appetite is shrinking, driving up demand for USDC. Is it time to pull back? Are investors pulling back in the New Year? USD Coin [USDC] supply has surged to $2 billion – its highest in 707 days, while the global crypto market cap falls 3.49%. History hints at a pullback, but with the current volatility, could a crash be looming instead? Trump’s inauguration is behind us, the SEC has approved its first crypto regulation, and Bitcoin is still 6.18% below its $109K all-time high. No doubt, this week’s volatility has investors divided – some are pulling back, while others are HODLing strong, leaving BTC caught in a tug-of-war. The good news? BTC is holding above $100K, a level that’s sparked rebounds recently. In the last two weeks, BTC has dropped to this level three times, each time triggering an increase in outflows. Looks like investors are seeing this as a dip to buy. However, Bitcoin is just 3.54% above its weekly gains that pushed it past $109K. If those gains slip, BTC could fall to $98.4K. Adding to the caution, USDC supply has spiked to a two-year high. In just three days, USDC across exchanges dropped 17.21%, with Binance seeing an 18% decline. The jump in USDC supply to $2 billion from just $303K the previous day isn’t a fluke – investors are clearly playing it safe. Source: CryptoQuant As more investors move to USDC or cash out after realizing profits, the pressure to absorb this liquidity now falls on institutions. MicroStrategy is doing its part, having already made two purchases totaling 3,600 BTC this month alone. And it doesn’t stop there. BlackRock just made their largest Bitcoin buy of the year – $600 million worth of BTC. Could this be a sign of more institutional buying ahead that could stabilize the market? Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, ETFs are seeing steady inflows, keeping BTC above $100K with institutional support. However, the decline in greed signals a shrinking risk appetite, with investors flocking to stablecoins like USDC instead of Bitcoin. The debate over Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ is clearly intensifying. In fact, $818 million worth of Tether USD (ERC20) coins moved off exchanges just a day before Trump’s swearing-in ceremony – the largest outflow in a year. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 With Trump’s radical policies already grabbing headlines, it’s no surprise investors are exercising caution. Now, with stability in question, the focus is on which asset will dominate – stablecoins or Bitcoin. For now, stablecoins seem to have the upper hand, but the battle is far from over.

Title: Why EA Stock Is Diving Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) is plummeting 17% after the company reported lower-than-expected bookings for its fiscal third quarter that ended in December. EA also cut its full-year bookings guidance for its current fiscal year. EA blamed the bad news primarily on the subpar performance of its new soccer game, EA Sports FC 2025. A Look at EA's Results and Guidance The firm generated Q3 bookings of $2.22 billion last quarter, below its prior outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion. Moreover, the video game maker now expects its bookings for its current full fiscal year to come in at $7 billion to $7.15 billion, versus its previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Also importantly, EA is predicting that its bookings obtained after game purchases will fall by about 5% during its current fiscal year. It had previously predicted that this metric would climb by about 5%. The company's latest soccer game, EA Sports FC 25 "underperformed our net bookings expectations,” CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement. After reviews of the game were underwhelming following its release last September, the revenue generated by the company's soccer games is expected to drop this quarter versus the same period a year earlier. The Recent Price Action of EA Stock In the last month, the shares have sunk 21.5%, while they have slumped 19% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of EA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Inflation could drive bond yields to 20-year highs and shock the stock market, BlackRock chief Larry Fink says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/interest-rates-bond-yields-stock-market-outlook-inflation-outlook-trump-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-23T15:52:03Z
Full Content:
The BlackRock chief Larry Fink says Treasury yields could soar to the highest level in over two decades, with inflation causing a bond market sell-off that spills over into the stock market. The CEO of the world's largest asset manager predicted that the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond could rise to as high as 5.5% if inflation rises and hurts demand for government debt. That would represent the highest yield on the 10-year Treasury note in about 25 years, with the bond last reaching 5.5% in 2000. Yields at those levels could catch investors off guard, as many probably aren't pricing in the possibility of higher inflation, Fink said. He pointed to policies from the new administration that could create fresh pricing pressures in the economy. "I believe it will unlock all this private capital and we're going to have enormous growth," Fink told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday. "At the same time, some of this is going to create new inflationary pressures. And I do believe that's probably the risk that is not factored into the markets." He added: "There's a probability we could see the 10-year over 5%, maybe even 5.5%. That would shock the equity market. That would not be a good scenario." The 10-year yield surpassing 5% isn't Fink's base case, but he suggested that if it were to occur, it would likely spark losses in the stock market, adding that such a scenario could have a "very negative impact" on equities and could "force a revaluation." Bond yields have been sent on a wild ride in the past year, partly because of concerns about a resurgence of inflation, which could cause interest rates to stay higher for longer as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to cool prices down. Economists, meanwhile, have criticized some of President Donald Trump's policies — like his plan to levy steep tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — as inflationary. Trump has pushed back on that point, promising to lower prices for Americans in his second term. But bond investors have been highly sensitive to news about Trump's trade policy, with yields spiking earlier in January on fears of aggressive trade policy and a hot economy. The 10-year rapidly approached 5% this month before pulling back on more-benign inflation data and softer-than-expected tariff orders on day one of Trump's term this week. Concern about the national debt has also weighed on the bond market. A group of investors known as bond vigilantes could refuse to buy Treasurys or sell their holdings to pressure the government to exercise more fiscal restraint. Fink added that yields touching 5% could be a major catalyst in pushing the conversation about managing the US debt. The federal debt balance clocked in at a record $36.2 trillion on Thursday.

Meet the creative minds behind viral social media campaigns at Social Media Week, May 12-14 in New York City. Register now to save 35% on your pass. Welcome to this episode of the Marketing Vanguard podcast. Today, we have a special guest: Alex Craddock, chief marketing and content officer at Citi. Join host Jenny Rooney and Alex as they discuss his unique journey from sales to marketing leadership, the evolution of financial services marketing, and how creative constraints can drive innovation. With experience spanning automotive, digital marketing, and financial services at companies like Visa, BlackRock, and now Citi, Alex brings a wealth of knowledge about transforming marketing organizations and driving business impact through innovative strategies. Financial Brand Empower Names Goodby Silverstein & Partners as Agency of Record “When budgets get cut and things of that nature, everyone’s initial reaction is shoulders drop and all, woe is us,” he says on the podcast. “Just think about it as another constraint, and I guarantee you, you’ll have some really brilliant ideas that will be just as impactful, if not more so, at a lower cost.” Prior to Citi, Alex spent eight years at BlackRock, where he led global marketing for the iShares franchise and served as global CMO. His career includes significant roles at HP, Visa, and various other global organizations, where he has consistently driven transformation and growth through innovative marketing approaches. [19:41] The Evolution of Financial Services Marketing — Alex emphasizes that financial services marketing has evolved from being primarily sales enablement to becoming truly strategic marketing. He notes that the industry’s complexity, from serving retail to institutional clients, combined with the need to balance brand and performance marketing, creates unique challenges and opportunities. The disruption from new entrants in the space has forced incumbent brands to become more innovative and entrepreneurial in their approach. [11:14] Marketing Transformation at Citi — Alex discusses Citi’s recent transformation under Jane Fraser’s leadership, highlighting the shift to a more focused global organization. He emphasizes the importance of unifying previously fragmented marketing teams to create a more integrated, client-centric approach. The transformation aims to harness collective marketing expertise while maintaining a consistent brand message across different audience segments. [23:48] The Power of Creative Constraints — One of Alex’s key insights is how constraints, whether regulatory or budgetary, can drive creativity and innovation. He shares that some of his team’s best work has emerged from periods of budget constraints, forcing them to think differently and more creatively about engaging customers and driving impact. [24:34] Future Plans and Initiatives at Citi — Alex shares exciting developments at Citi, including the reorganization of the marketing team and new initiatives in the wealth management business. He discusses the significant opportunity in the wealth space, with projections of $100 trillion in new wealth creation over the next decade. The team is also reviewing their sponsorship portfolio and exploring new properties to support their global footprint. [28:39] Leadership Philosophy — When asked about his leadership style using a soccer analogy, Alex chooses to be the coach rather than a player. He emphasizes creating an environment where his team of 1,000 people worldwide can grow, do their best work, and achieve ambitious goals they didn’t think possible. His focus is on fostering a safe space where team members feel respected, valued, and recognized. Jenny Rooney is Chief Brand and Community Officer, leading strategy for the overall ADWEEK brand as well as the ways in which we serve and support our audiences with high-value content, products, partnerships and experiences, notably through our community programs such as Marketing Vanguard.

Title: Pundit Predicts Dogecoin’s Explosion To $15 As Bitwise Officially Submits Registration Filing For DOGE ETF
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pundit-predicts-dogecoins-explosion-to-15-as-bitwise-officially-submits-registration-filing-for-doge-etf/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T15:40:24Z
Full Content:
Crypto asset manager Bitwise has registered a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund entity in Delaware, a move that could usher in future ETFs based on the world’s largest memecoin. Heightened demand could propel DOGE to astronomical heights if the ETF captures even a small fraction of the inflows witnessed by the successful spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to a Jan. 22 filing, Bitwise registered “Bitwise DOGECOIN ETF” as a statutory trust through the CSC Delaware Trust Company in Wilmington. While such filings may often be a hoax, like the fake BlackRock XRP ETF filing in 2023, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has confirmed that the Bitwise filing is indeed legit. “Bitwise Doge ETF likely coming soon.. and yes I checked and this is def legit,” Balchunas wrote on X. However, experts say the Delaware registration only represents an initial administrative step toward what could be an ETF launch. This simply means that Bitwise would still need to file a comprehensive application with the SEC before any potential DOGE product could come to market. The timing of Bitwise’s filing coincides with an increased institutional demand for crypto exposure through regulated products amid a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation in the US. President Donald Trump, sworn in on Jan. 20 as the 47th President of the United States, has promised to create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment for digital assets. Bitwise’s registration filing comes on the back of asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares submitting numerous proposals for crypto-based exchange-traded funds, one of which was a Dogecoin ETF. Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a joke, parodying the industry with its presumed lack of utility. The seventh-largest crypto has, however, taken on new life in recent months thanks to the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) in the US, which is now led by noted DOGE token fan Elon Musk. In fact, the DOGE agency website briefly featured the iconic Dogecoin logo earlier this week. Nevertheless, the price of DOGE has declined by around 20% since President Trump launched his surprise Solana meme coin, TRUMP, falling from a price of $0.4318 — the highest level seen for the original and still most valuable meme coin by market cap in more than a month — to a current mark of $0.35. But crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees the DOGE price soaring to a staggering $15 if the new Securities and Exchange Commission under Trump approves a spot market Dogecoin ETF.

Title: Morgan Stanley CEO signals potential crypto expansion under pro-crypto Trump administration

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick announced the bank will be working with US regulators to explore expanding its crypto market presence, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. “For us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors,” Pick told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way.” This announcement comes at a time when the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration is reshaping the regulatory landscape. Earlier this week, the acting head of the SEC launched an effort to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. Morgan Stanley was the first major US financial institution to offer Bitcoin funds to its wealth management clients in 2021. The bank later expanded its services in 2024 to allow financial advisors to market Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity. Pick, who became CEO in January 2024, discussed Bitcoin’s durability in the market. “The broader question is whether some of this has come of age, whether it’s hit escape velocity,” he said. “You know, time is the friend of crypto; the longer it trades, perception becomes reality.” The bank’s move comes as the regulatory landscape shifts. While banks were previously restricted from owning “physical” Bitcoin under the Biden administration, limiting their activities to derivatives, recent regulatory changes signal a more accommodating environment. On Tuesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan shared his perspective in an interview with CNBC. He expressed that if clear regulations are introduced to legitimize business activities with crypto, the banking system would embrace it in a significant way.

Title: Will Solaxy Be the Next Presale to Explode While the Solana Bulls Are Winning?

Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana have held their support levels even when the global crypto market fell by 1.7%, now sitting at a market cap of $3.5T. Bitcoin ETFs have seen four consecutive inflow days led by BlackRock. The investment giant has gobbled up $3.2B worth of BTC. CEO Larry Fink suggests that BTC can reach $700,000 if funds increase allocation to 5% from 2%. This ETF influx stems from the hopes of Solana ETF getting approvals in 2025. Market data suggests a 97% probability of that happening, too. Solana has also seen a significant surge since 15th January. It currently stands at 34% gains from the lows of $181.88 on 14th Jan. During this time, it reached a high of $295.83, gaining almost 60% in 5 days. The price has since stabilized at around $240. XRP also saw a similar price boost as it rose from $2.3545 on January 1 to a high of $3.4 on 16th Jan – a gain of almost 62%. XRP’s price has also since been steady and is now trading at around $3.0886. Ever since Trump won the presidential elections, the crypto market has seen quite a significant boom. Bitcoin reached an all-time high, crossing the $109,000 mark. Trump’s pro-crypto approach and promises to bring in crypto-friendly legislation have kept the hopes of crypto enthusiasts high. There are already early signs of that happening. For instance, Trump’s decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht is being viewed as good news for privacy-preserving technology advancement in the crypto field. The launch of $TRUMP, the US president’s official meme coin, has also drawn the attention of investors. Soon after its launch last week, $TRUMP quickly shot up by over 12,000% overnight. With the influx of various projects, the meme coin market looks bullish for the next year. If you’re looking to ride this upcoming bull run, we’ve got a project you can invest in – Solaxy ($SOLX). Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s first Layer-2 solution that looks to solve the issues of failed transactions, congestion, and scalability bottlenecks in the Solana Layer-1 chains. With time, Solana has become slow as the traffic has increased, leading to longer wait times. Solaxy looks to solve this through bundling transactions. Another unique thing about $SOLX is that it’s a one-of-a-kind multi-chain solution that works on both Solana and Ethereum networks. This way, $SOLX combines the best of both networks – Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s transaction speeds, easily making it one of the best meme coins. Having already raised over $13M, the $SOLX presale is off to a flier; here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX if you want to grab some for $0.001612 per token. The next price increase is set to take place within 2 days from now. So, this is the lowest you may get $SOLX for — a coin that could potentially make you a crypto millionaire in 2025. For starters, Solaxy isn’t just another hype-based meme coin. It solves a very important issue faced by crypto investors. By sharing the burden of Solana 1 layer, it batch processes transactions, leading to lower costs and quick turnaround time. This utility puts it in a unique position, making it one of the hottest meme coin presales in January. Also, a new Bitwise report has predicted that the price of Solana ($SOL) can reach $6,636 by 2030 – a massive 3,000% increase. The same report states that Solana’s Layer 1 is far more efficient than the Layer 2 Ethereum chain. Going by the indications, if Solana is able to draw a price prediction this huge, Solaxy soaring by 100x doesn’t look a far stretch. With 30% of the token supply reserved for development and 10% for listing, the developers have shown signs of long-term commitment. Solaxy’s official X page currently has 62.5K followers, which is in line with its aim of building a strong investor community. If you’re looking to take advantage of the crypto and meme coin bull run that’s to come, buy $SOLX now from its official website.

Title: Tesla's Price Hike Is First Sign Of The Impending Tariff War

Good morning! It’s Thursday, January 23, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know. President Donald Trump threatened all kinds of tariffs on imports from countries such as Mexico, China and even Canada while out on the campaign trail. Now that he’s in office, the “Home Alone 2” actor has kicked off his efforts to bring in duties of up to 25 percent on products imported into the U.S. from February 1, and this has sparked a response from north of the border that could see buyers in both America and Canada worse off. The first victim of this impending face off may have come sooner than expected, as Tesla just hiked prices of its electric cars in Canada, reports InsideEVs. The company has raised prices on all of its models except the Cybertruck, which only launched in the country at the end of last year: The biggest bump in pricing will be for the Model 3 sedan, which will see its MSRP go up as much as $6,200 (C$9,000). Meanwhile, all variants of the Model Y, Model S and Model X will see increases of $2,750 (C$4,000). It’s unclear what the reason behind the pricing increases is, as Tesla did not explain the move. That said, it might have something to do with the impending tariff war between the United States and Canada. Earlier this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made it clear that its government plans to respond accordingly if U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting next month. The price hikes in Canada show what the real impact of Trump’s tariffs could be: price rises across the board. Additional fees on imports from Canada and Mexico in particular will have a dramatic impact on the auto industry, as top-selling models like the Toyota Tacoma, Honda CR-V and Nissan Versa are all produced away from America’s fair shores. Should Trump get his way and a 25 percent tariff is added to those vehicles, the price is likely to be passed on to you, the consumer. What, did you think automakers would just happily make 25 percent less money on each car sold? The corpse of failed EV maker Canoo is still warm, but we already have to move onto the potential demise of another struggling electric vehicle maker: VinFast. The Vietnamese automaker has had a rocky launch for its electric models and has cost its parent company billions in recent years, which is finally taking its toll on shareholders. VinFast parent company VinGroup is now facing pressure from shareholders to dramatically reduce funding for the struggling automaker, after plowing $17 billion into the EV maker last year alone, reports Reuters. Foreign investors in the brands are now offloading their shares in VinGroup as profits take a hit as a result of VinFast’s struggles: Among foreigners who fully divested their holdings in the conglomerate last year are investment vehicles of BlackRock and DWS, while JPMorgan’s asset management unit nearly halved its stake to 0.13%, according to LSEG data. Vingroup’s largest foreign investor, South Korean conglomerate SK Group, is planning to sell by mid-February about one-fifth of its 6% holding as part of a possibly broader divestment plan in Southeast Asia. Vingroup said foreigners’ net selling was a wider trend in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, driven largely by high interest rates in the United States. VinFast lost nearly $2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, latest data show, but is narrowing its losses as revenue grew thanks to car sales having exceeded its revised-down target last year. The losses are reflecting badly on the valuation at parent company VinGroup, adds Reuters, with VingGroup’s market capitalization shrinking by “nearly half” to $6 billion since VinFast’s listing. The company’s share price has fallen six percent in the past year as well. The solution? Well it looks as though VinFast may be finding a way to claw its way back from the brink. Sales were up in the third quarter of 2024 and the company is still eyeing further expansion around the world. It’s going to have to sell an awful lot of cars to make good on that $17 billion loan, though. The U.S. recall championship has been off to a strong start in 2025, with Tesla, Chevrolet and Kia all announcing huge recalls of defective models so far this year. Now, Stellantis has got its first major recall on the board after power loss issues hit the Jeep Cherokee. Stellantis has issued a recall of 63,000 Jeep Cherokee SUVs sold across America, reports CBS News. The recall was called for after certain 2017-2019 models were found to have a defect that could cause the vehicles to lose power and impede parking: As a result of a poorly seated input shaft ring, the vehicles’ “power transfer unit (PTU) may become damaged and disengage the transmission and differential, resulting in a loss of drive power and/or loss of park function,” the recall documents state. “A loss of drive power can increase the risk of a crash. A loss of park function can cause an unintended vehicle rollaway, which can increase the risk of a crash or injury.” Though drivers may experience “a Service 4WD message, noise, vibration or change in drive quality,” the manufacturer cautions that “a loss of motive power can cause a vehicle crash without prior warning.” The recall documents do not state whether Stellantis is aware of any crashes or injuries related to this issue. Stellantis hasn’t yet outlined a fix for the issue, but added that notification letters will be mailed to impacted owners around February 13. If you are worried that your car might be affected by a recall, there are a few easy ways to check if it’s the case. First up, the NHTSA has a super handy app that you can use to see if your vehicle is impacted by a recall, or you can head to the regulator’s website and plug your VIN into its recall search tool. Just days after the new administration heralded an end to an electric vehicle mandate that never actually existed, the impact of the new government’s anti-EV stance is taking shape. Support for new EV buyers has already dropped and now Nissan has announced that it’s scrapped plans for a small electric crossover that could have been sold in America. Nissan has reportedly shelved plans for a subcompact electric crossover that could have been built at its Canton, Mississippi, plant, reports Automotive News. The decision comes amid a turbulent time for the EV market and for Nissan: The financially hamstrung automaker told suppliers that it won’t build the electric vehicle — code-named PZ1L — at its plant in Canton, Miss., sources tell Automotive News. Instead, output is expected to be consolidated at Nissan’s factory in Sunderland, England, according to AutoForecast Solutions. Nissan spokesperson Brian Brockman said the automaker is focusing on other EV projects for the Canton plant that would better meet market needs and deliver higher volumes. “We will continue to evaluate market opportunities for new models and make adjustments accordingly,” Brockman said. The decision comes just months after Nissan revealed it was pausing plans for next-generation EV production to come to Canton. The move put a $500 million investment in the plant on hold. Now, Nissan is nearing a deal that would see it join together with fellow Japanese automaker Honda. If the pair joins forces they could share the development costs of new electric models and better utilize their current facilities to help lower the cost of next-generation eclectic models. The first Frisbees—originally known as "flying saucers"—are produced in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Title: CEO Of The World’s Largest Asset Manager Sees Bitcoin Hitting $700,000 If This Happens

Larry Fink, the CEO of the $10 trillion asset management giant BlackRock, sees a world in which the price of Bitcoin (BTC) reaches a whopping $700,000. If asset managers allocated at least 2% to 5% of their assets to Bitcoin, the asset could eventually reach the coveted six-figure price point, Fink said on Wednesday during a conversation with Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Larry Fink indicated that he believes Bitcoin could potentially rocket to $700,000 amid currency debasement fears. “As I became a student of crypto, it was very clear to me that crypto is a currency of fear,” said Fink. “But that’s OK. If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an international-based instrument called Bitcoin that can overcome those local fears.” Fink said Bitcoin is an investment many are considering making, including the managers of a sovereign wealth fund that Fink met with while in Switzerland this week. Fink said they were mulling whether to allocate 2% or 5% to BTC. “If everybody adopted that conversation,” he stated, “it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 for Bitcoin.” In an attempt to temper any overexcitement stemming from his comment, Fink quickly told the audience that his words were not intended as a promotion of Bitcoin. It wasn’t so long ago that Larry Fink had dismissed Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering.” In 2021, Fink stated during an interview that BlackRock had witnessed “very little demand” for cryptocurrencies from their clients. But his view on Bitcoin has since changed dramatically. Back in 2023, the BlackRock boss asserted that the biggest and oldest crypto Bitcoin was “digitizing gold” and making crypto, in general, “more democratized and … much cheaper for investors.” Then, in early 2024, BlackRock launched a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which eventually grew big enough to surpass its gold ETF in total assets under management.

"I'm cautiously optimistic. That being said, I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink said Thursday on CNBC's "Squawk Box" from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "I believe if it'll unlock all this private capital, we're going to have enormous growth. At the same time, some of this is going to create new inflationary pressures. I do believe that's probably the risk that is not factored into the markets. I think the bond market is going to tell us where we're going." The 72-year-old chief of the world's largest asset manager said much will depend on how quickly the private sector can put capital to work. Trump has already touted massive private sector promises to spend in the U.S., the latest example being the Stargate joint venture, where SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle would invest $100 billion immediately for artificial intelligence infrastructure in the country. Plans call for the project to eventually invest a total of $500 billion. "There are some very large inflationary pressures that we all have to be aware of," Fink said. "And depending on how this plays out, there is a scenario where we're going to have much more elevated interest rates because of inflation. And that's going to have a very negative impact on the equity market." Fink said there is a possibility that the 10-year Treasury yield could retest the 5% level and even reach 5.5% if inflation reaccelerates in a meaningful way. If that happens, Fink said it would "shock" the equity market. The benchmark 10-year note yield last traded at 4.62%. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: BlackRock boss predicts $700,000 Bitcoin

Bitcoin could reach an astonishing $700,000 if institutional investors allocate between 2% and 5% of their portfolios to the cryptocurrency, Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, has predicted. The digital coin has seen a surge in its value in recent months. In 2024, its price jumped 121%, reaching the peak of $108,135 in December. On Monday, following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, Bitcoin hit a record $109,225. Trump had previously announced plans to make the US the world’s “crypto capital” and to set up a national Bitcoin reserve. Fink told an audience at a panel in Davos on Wednesday that he is “a big believer” in the world’s largest cryptocurrency as an instrument, highlighting its potential as a financial hedge. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears,” Fink said. The investor cited a momentum towards institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. “I was with a sovereign-wealth fund during this week, and there was a conversation, should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 for bitcoin,” argued Fink. The investor noted that he wasn’t promoting the token. Last year, BlackRock launched Bitcoin Trust and Ethereum Trust, exchange-traded funds investing directly into the two crypto tokens. Fink used to be skeptical of digital assets. In 2018, he told Bloomberg that BlackRock’s clients had zero interest in crypto. Created in 2009, Bitcoin allows people to send and receive money over the internet without relying on traditional banks or governments. The decentralized nature of the token has also facilitated its misuse by organized crime gangs and for other illicit purposes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. The price is primarily affected by supply, market demand, availability, competing cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment. Despite wide use for buying goods and services, there are no uniform international laws that regulate Bitcoin. The token was adopted as official currency in El Salvador in 2021. Governments around the world have been wary of the cryptocurrencies’ growing influence, warning about the dangers of investing into a volatile asset. According to an opinion piece by financial analyst Susie Violet Ward published by Forbes on Monday, Bitcoin’s institutionalization would compromise its original ethos as “freedom money,” with regulatory and economic control eroding the token’s decentralization.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Prem Watsa's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against Prem Watsa's other long-term stock picks. Prem Watsa is a Canadian billionaire, entrepreneur, and investor often referred to as the Canadian Warren Buffett for his value-based investment approach and long-term focus. As the founder, chairman, and CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, Watsa has built a reputation for transforming his company into one of the leading insurance and investment firms in the world. His ability to identify undervalued opportunities and navigate financial crises has cemented his place as one of the most respected figures in global finance. Watsa was born in India in 1950 to a middle-class family. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, one of India’s premier institutions. In 1972, Watsa immigrated to Canada to pursue an MBA at the University of Western Ontario’s Richard Ivey School of Business. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. After completing his MBA, Watsa began his career in the insurance industry, where he gained valuable experience that would later shape his business philosophy and success. In 1985, Watsa acquired control of Markel Financial, a struggling Canadian insurance company. He renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings, short for Fair and Friendly Acquisitions, and set out to implement his vision of combining insurance underwriting with value-oriented investing. Fairfax operates as a holding company, similar to Berkshire Hathaway, with investments spanning insurance, reinsurance, and other businesses. Under Watsa's leadership, Fairfax has grown exponentially. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Fairfax manages over $1 billion in 13F securities. The company has delivered a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15% in book value per share since its founding. Prem Watsa is a staunch proponent of value investing, inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His strategy involves identifying undervalued assets, particularly during times of market distress, and holding them for the long term. Watsa has been a strong advocate of investing in India, acquiring stakes in companies like Thomas Cook India and launching the Fairfax India fund to capitalize on the country’s growth. Watsa famously anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, using derivatives to protect Fairfax’s portfolio and earning over $2 billion in profits during the crash. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Fairfax Financial Holdings at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80 Fairfax Financial Holdings' Stake: $13.3 million Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. The following points illustrate the company's robust investment outlook. Firstly, as per the report for the third quarter of 2024, performance was driven by focused commercial execution and robust double-digit revenue growth across the product portfolio. Additionally, the company raised full-year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $61 to $64 Billion and raised adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $2.75 to $2.95. This demonstrates the strong business growth of the company and its confidence in its future performance. Secondly, the company has selected its preferred once-daily modified-release formulation for danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Pfizer plans to conduct dose optimization studies, evaluating multiple doses of the preferred modified release formulation to inform the registration enabling studies. Overall PFE ranks 9th on our list of billionaire Prem Watsa's top long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images) John Stossel / @JohnStossel John Stossel is the creator of Stossel TV videos, and author of "No They Can't! Why Government Fails—But Individuals Succeed." “Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG, or environmental, social, and governance, were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus Investments claimed it helped meet United Nations sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension [funds] like CalPERS and the New York pension [fund] who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!’” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: “They will invest into climate-related efforts,” he intoned. Today, banks and even BlackRock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism–producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have swung wildly this week as traders brace for U.S. president Donald Trump to drop a bitcoin price bombshell. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price surged to an all-time high on Monday but has dropped back alongside Trump's new memecoin. Now, as fears grow of U.S. dollar crisis at the Federal Reserve, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink as revealed he's had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin—which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of $14 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the loudest supporters of bitcoin and crypto ...

"If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. Fink warned that inflation fears have spurred interest in bitcoin, with governments ramping up spending and stimulus measures in recent years to combat the effects of Covid-era lockdowns. "If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, you can have an internationally based instrument called bitcoin that will overcome those local fears,” Fink said. Inflation surged in recent years, peaking at over 10% and forcing the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral" as Fed officials continue to grapple with a looming stagflation "nightmare" scenario. Last year, BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto said sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in bitcoin alongside wild speculation that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund was exploring buying bitcoin.

"Many of these interested firms—whether we're talking about pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, other asset managers, family offices—are having ongoing diligence and research conversations, and we're playing a role from an education perspective," Mitchnick said in May 2024, adding BlackRock has seen "a re-initiation of the discussion around bitcoin." Meanwhile, Donald Trump's plans to create a bitcoin reserve similar to the U.S. gold reserve or its oil stockpile has pushed bitcoin into the limelight. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Altria Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Altria Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Altria Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Altria Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Altria Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Altria Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Altria Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 39% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Altria Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Altria Group (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is the undisputed king of the meme coins, with a market cap of about $56 billion. The coin has been in a roaring rally since late last year, rising by 355%, and, with the Trump administration signaling a serious pro-crypto bent, it's no surprise that investors are interested in making big gains with a purchase. Is it possible to make a decent sum of $10,000 with a timely investment in this meme, even if your starting capital is on the small side? In the closing of the recent trading day, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) stood at $240.91, denoting a +0.25% change from the preceding trading day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 30% in 2024, while Ark Innovation ETF returned 8.4%. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) shares are trading lower on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $36. Halliburton reported a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 2.3% year-over-year to $5.610 billion, missing the consensus of $5.63 billion. Completion and Production revenue fell 4.2% YoY to $3.2 billion, with $629 million operating income. The analyst noted that softer revenue was mainly due to a decline in Completion and Produc Energy Transfer LP (ET) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Advertising revenue doubled this past year, co-CEO Gregory Peters said, and the company expects the same to be true in 2025. Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. Vistra stock was rising Tuesday after authorities lifted evacuation orders issued because of a fire at a company power plant last week. The utility stock gained 8.8% to $185.83 in afternoon trading, on track for an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The fire took place at a lithium-ion battery facility at a Vistra power plant in Moss Landing, Calif. Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Super Micro (SMCI). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Why The “Bitcoin President” Is Really More Of An “Ethereum President”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2025/01/23/why-the-bitcoin-president-is-really-more-of-an-ethereum-president/

President Trump takes questions from the press. In a surprising twist that has created controversy in the Bitcoin community, recent moves by President Trump’s newly launched World Liberty Financial have cast fresh light on the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the heart of the controversy is a transaction involving wrapped bitcoin and bitcoin, terms that are anything but synonymous. On Jan. 20, Donald Trump Jr. posted a series of strategic token purchases that commemorated the inauguration of his father as the 47th president of the United States. The purchases included: At first glance, this might appear to affirm bitcoin’s centrality in Trump’s digital currency realm. However, a closer look reveals that aside from TRX, all tokens are Ethereum-based assets. Wrapped Bitcoin, for example, is not stored on the bitcoin blockchain but instead exists as an ERC20 token on Ethereum. It is backed 1:1 by bitcoin through a complex minting process that involves trusted custodians and merchant intermediaries. The mechanism behind WBTC underscores its multifaceted utility. As outlined in its 2019 whitepaper, WBTC is a fundamentally different version of bitcoin, designed to leverage Ethereum’s expansive decentralized finance ecosystem. Users who acquire wrapped bitcoin gain exposure to bitcoin’s value while enjoying the benefits of Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and turing complete functionality. These include lending, borrowing, and yield generation, to name a few. However the token’s holder does not own bitcoin in the elemental sense. Instead, they possess a derivative that exists only on another chain. This arrangement enhances token interoperability and serves as a clever, if controversial, marketing tool for political figures like Trump. With the formation of World Liberty Financial in August 2024, questions have surfaced regarding the actual amount of bitcoin holdings. The widespread publicity surrounding these transactions now casts doubt on previously held assumptions that the president and his advisors were staunch bitcoin advocates, revealing instead a tilt toward Ethereum’s ecosystem. The debate between bitcoin and its wrapped counterpart touches on deeper ideological and practical considerations for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, heralded by industry veterans such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is praised for its scarcity, store-of-value properties, and robust security anchored by proof-of-work. Armstrong even noted bitcoin’s superiority over gold regarding divisibility and portability. In contrast, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, which converted from proof-of-work in September 2022, offers enhanced versatility for decentralized applications. Adding another layer of intrigue, the transaction post included TRX, the native token of Tron. Tron has faced intense scrutiny. Despite being part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem, Tron has faced intense scrutiny. A report from TRM Labs highlighted that while Tron achieved a remarkable reduction in illicit activity in 2024, it still accounted for 58% of all illicit crypto volumes. This reality continues challenging the balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in digital finance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, stated that President Trump’s support for digital currencies could transform the banking industry's stance on crypto. He stated, “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” Earlier this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability. “If you're frightened of the debasement of your currency…you can have an internationally-based instrument called bitcoin,” Fink asserts, recognizing its growing appeal as a secure and portable store of value. According to these expert opinions, both types of cryptocurrency play crucial roles. The ongoing debate of wrapped bitcoin versus bitcoin is more than a technical dispute. It is a battle over the very identity of digital money in an era of rapid innovation and political repositioning. As Donald Trump’s portfolio of digital tokens becomes increasingly intertwined with Ethereum-based assets, the “Bitcoin President” narrative may be a misnomer. Instead, for many, it signifies a fundamental shift in which the distinctions between blockchain platforms become increasingly blurred, and the President’s pursuit of personal gain may override ideological purity. Time will tell if Trump can claim credit as a true bitcoin patron or if Ethereum, and other smart contract layer ones, will take center stage. As the debate rages on, one thing is sure. The dynamic interplay between innovation, politics, and technology is transforming the face of money in our digital age. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin price today: slips to $102k as Trump boost fades, $TRUMP tumbles

Investing.com-- Bitcoin slid on Thursday after a short-lived rally on hype over more crypto-friendly policies from President Donald Trump, with his recently launched memecoin also clocking steep losses. Cryptocurrency markets took fleeting support from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which, under new leadership, said it will form a task force to help advise on crypto regulation. Markets were left wanting as Trump did not sign any executive orders related to crypto in his first few days in office, despite several industry participants hoping for such a move. The launch of $TRUMP, which logged wild price swings since its debut, also contributed to additional volatility in markets, while hype over artificial intelligence saw risk-heavy traders turn more biased towards equity markets. Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $102,530.0 by 09:14 ET (14:14 GMT). The world’s biggest cryptocurrency briefly hit a record high above $109,000 before Trump’s inauguration this week, but has since logged steep declines. Bitcoin largely failed to maintain its gains this week, as optimism over crypto-friendly policies under Trump appeared to be short-lived. While the SEC announcement does herald some progress towards friendlier regulation, the commission provided few details on just what policies will be covered by its task force. The SEC also did not provide a timeline for new regulation. A major point of contention for crypto markets was also that Trump signed no crypto-related executive orders, while his threats of tariffs on major economies dented risk appetite. Trump’s memecoin- $TRUMP- slid nearly 13% to $35.27 on Thursday, sliding further from record highs of nearly $80 hit just after its launch. The token raised some concerns over the ethics of Trump using his influence to further his personal wealth. The President was seen largely avoiding questions over the billions of dollar of paper gains he had likely made from $TRUMP. Needham & Co. said that its proprietary ‘Crypto Euphoria Needham Diagram’ (CEND) has reached its highest levels since the index’s inception, signaling heightened market sentiment for cryptocurrencies and nearing “extreme euphoria.” The CEND index, which measures crypto market cycles using various metrics, rose to 64 this week, up from 55 in December 2024. While this marks a significant increase, it remains below the October 2021 peak of 82. “This week CEND reached its highest levels since we began publishing the index,” the firm noted. “Nearly every underlying metric we analyze to track the crypto cycle has gone higher following the Trump inauguration.” The index incorporates six key metrics, analyzing sentiment among retail, crypto-native, and institutional investors, alongside “risk on” indicators like the MVRV Z-score and Bitcoin dominance. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink offered some positive comments on Bitcoin, stating that he believed the crypto could rise to a $700,000 price if more people adopted it on concerns over the economic and political stability of their countries. Fink told Bloomberg that he believed in the utilization of Bitcoin as an internationally based instrument, although he clarified he was not promoting the crypto. BlackRock had last year launched an exchange-traded fund that tracked the spot price of Bitcoin- iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT). The launch had initially attracted a deluge of capital flows in early-2024, although inflows have since floundered. Broader crypto prices fell in tandem with Bitcoin. World no.2 crypto Ether fell 1.8% to $3,227.73, while XRP retreated 2.4% to $3.089. Solana, Cardano, and Polygon sank between 1.8% and 5%, while among meme tokens, Dogecoin dropped 2.9%.

Title: EV maker VinFast's losses heap pressure on parent Vingroup as foreign investors sell

* Vingroup's shares close to multi-year lows, fall most among top Vietnam firms * Vingroup market cap has nearly halved since VinFast's Nasdaq listing * Agencies rate as junk the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit * Vingroup says it remains committed to VinFast's growth By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen HANOI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. This year "may become indicative of Vingroup's broader financial health," said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam. "Vingroup may face further financial erosion" if VinFast's performance does not improve, he said, adding that scaling back Vingroup's support to subsidiaries could mitigate financial strain. The conglomerate and its founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, poured $13.5 billion into the electric automaker as of October in loans and grants, and promised another nearly $3.5 billion in November, despite concerns about the bet investors raised at the company's last two annual shareholders' meetings. Vingroup's market capitalisation has shrunk by nearly half to about $6 billion since VinFast's listing in August 2023. Over the past year, its shares fell 6.6%, the most among the 10 largest listed companies in Vietnam, and underperforming the 7.5% rise for the Vietnam market, according to LSEG data. Its shares traded in December at their lowest level since 2017. They have recovered slightly since but were still close to that multi-year low level this week. "The biggest challenge for Vingroup remains VinFast," said Nguyen The Minh, head of research at Yuanta Securities Vietnam. Vingroup, however, is not backing off. "Vingroup has been and will continue to support the subsidiary's development," it told Reuters on Wednesday, reiterating its long-standing commitment to Nasdaq-listed VinFast. Strong expected growth for its units this year would attract investment in the company, Vingroup said. BORROWING COSTS So far, investors, especially from overseas, have been unconvinced. Since VinFast's listing, the value of foreigners' combined holdings in Vingroup has dropped by nearly 60% to 15.7 trillion dong ($620.5 million), faster than local investors', according to stock market data updated to last week. Among foreigners who fully divested their holdings in the conglomerate last year are investment vehicles of BlackRock and DWS, while JPMorgan's asset management unit nearly halved its stake to 0.13%, according to LSEG data. Vingroup's largest foreign investor, South Korean conglomerate SK Group, is planning to sell by mid-February about one-fifth of its 6% holding as part of a possibly broader divestment plan in Southeast Asia. Vingroup said foreigners' net selling was a wider trend in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, driven largely by high interest rates in the United States. VinFast lost nearly $2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, latest data show, but is narrowing its losses as revenue grew thanks to car sales having exceeded its revised-down target last year. Vingroup's revenue and profits rose in the first nine months of last year compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the sale of assets. However, Vingroup's borrowing costs are rising steadily. In May, it issued two-year bonds that paid 12.5% interest, above the average 10.6% in 2023 and 9.6% in 2022 for slightly longer maturities. Vingroup is not rated, but Fitch estimated earlier in January that its debt was expected to be close to risk levels for Vinhomes' ratings "due to rising investments in the group's automaker, and our expectations of a sustained operating cash burn". "Consolidated net debt/net property assets at Vingroup is expected to be above 55% over the short term," Fitch said, noting that if it moved beyond 60% on a sustained basis, that could lead to the downgrade of Vinhomes' current rating, making its debt costlier. Vingroup said its debt remained at stable levels. Vietnamese lender Techcombank, which is one of Vingroup's largest creditors, did not reply to a request for comment. Despite having a manageable, low debt, "Vinhomes' credit quality is constrained by its growth ambitions and linkages with its parent, Vingroup," Moody's said.

Title: Japanese investors boost foreign stock purchases on Fed rate-cut hopes

(Reuters) - Japanese investors raised their holdings in foreign stocks, driven by a benign U.S. core inflation report that fuelled expectations of Federal Reserve cuts and boosted global equities, while a strong yen also lifted domestic buying power. They invested a net 489.8 billion yen ($3.13 billion) into overseas stocks, for a sixth straight week through Jan. 18, marking their second-largest weekly net purchase since Sept. 7, 2024, according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Analysts noted that the investment in foreign stocks was also driven by increased flows into the new Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA) programme, a tax-free investment scheme, and they expect such investments to persist through March. U.S. core inflation data for December reported a 3.2% increase last week, slightly below the forecast of 3.3%. Strong fourth-quarter earnings from major firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs lifted the MSCI World Index by 2.56%, marking its largest weekly gain since Nov. 8, 2024. Japan's market participants also acquired foreign debt securities of a net 1.01 trillion yen, the highest for a week since Nov. 9. They poured 819.3 billion yen into long-term bonds and 194.2 billion yen into short-term bills. At the same time, Japanese stocks witnessed a marginal 66.1 billion yen worth of foreign outflows last week, contrasting 259.1 billion yen in inflows in the previous week. Japan's Nikkei share average reached a 1-1/2-month low of 38,055.68 last week, weighed down by a stronger yen and investor caution ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural speech. The Nikkei, however, has climbed nearly 3.5% so far this week, powered by SoftBank (TYO:9984) Group and other technology stocks, as Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund AI infrastructure. Foreign investors bought a net 876.1 billion yen in Japanese long-term bonds, the largest purchase in six weeks, while also adding a net 1.33 trillion yen worth of short-term bills last week.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink predicts Bitcoin will climb to $700k, says he’s a ‘big believer’

Larry Fink stated that sovereign wealth funds are looking to allocate 2% to 5% in Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to $700,000 if global economic and political instability prompts widespread adoption of the flagship crypto. Fink made the prediction while speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22. He outlined a scenario in which Bitcoin becomes a refuge for wealth preservation amid turmoil. He also said that he is a “big believer” in Bitcoin because it is an “internationally based instrument” that can protect people from currency debasement and economic instability. According to Fink: “If people across countries experiencing political and economic turmoil turn to Bitcoin to protect their purchasing power, we could see an unprecedented surge.” He said his projections are based on the fact that BlackRock’s clients, including major investment funds and asset managers, are increasingly inquiring about Bitcoin allocations. Fink revealed: “I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that’s what we talked about, that was the conversation: should we have a 2% allocation, should we have a 5% allocation?” Fink added that his remarks are not intended to promote investments in Bitcoin but shed light on the current perspective of institutional clients. He noted that widespread adoption of such strategies could drive Bitcoin’s value to $500,000, $600,000, or even $700,000. BlackRock recently published a report stating that Bitcoin adoption is outpacing other tech innovations, such as the internet and mobile phones. The report highlighted rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over traditional banking systems as the main drivers of this rapid growth. Moreover, BlackRock increased by 117% the number of IBIT shares acquired through its Global Allocation Fund in the last quarter, totaling 430,770 shares. Notably, BlackRock is the issuer of the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the IBIT. Farside Investors data reveals that IBIT has over $39 billion of net positive flows as of Jan. 21. Additionally, it became the top ETF of the decade, surpassing all its rivals’ inflows. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, recently stated that he had conversations with finance ministers of different countries who were considering creating strategic Bitcoin reserves if the US moves in this direction. According to Armstrong, the sovereign interest in BTC is one of the drivers that could propel its price to the “multiple millions price range.” It all depends on Bitcoin becoming the new gold standard, appealing to investors in multiple countries and boosting adoption.

Fink sat alongside Peng Xiao, CEO of UAE-based artificial intelligence company G42, when the conversation about AI turned to crypt. Xiao indicated that he believes crypto is the currency of AI, while Fink said it's a hedge against inflation and pessimism about what's happening in the world. “As I became a student of crypto, it was very clear to me that crypto is a currency of fear,” said Fink. “But that’s OK. If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an international-based instrument called Bitcoin that can overcome those local fears.” He shared a similar sentiment last July, suggesting that Bitcoin was an investment for those “frightened of the world.” But it’s an investment that many are considering making, including the operators of a sovereign wealth fund that Fink met with while in Switzerland earlier this week. Fink said they were debating whether to have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation,” he said, “it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 for Bitcoin.” However, Fink cheekily told the audience that his words were not intended as a promotion of Bitcoin. Fink and BlackRock have become deeply intertwined with crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum thanks to their spot ETF offerings for both assets, which have experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, eventually grew large enough to overtake its gold ETF in assets under management. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the last 24 hours to $104,000, after setting a new all-time high price of $108,786 on Monday.

Title: Why Companies Are Ditching ESG

ESG John Stossel | 1.22.2025 4:15 PM "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social, and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet United Nations sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors…actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension [funds] like CalPERS and the New York pension [fund] who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even BlackRock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed…and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software," whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel's stock fell 60 percent last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism—producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe's will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to "narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing." When I was co-host of 20/20, I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, "We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough leads." Disney's television animation producer added, "I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness." But many such movies flopped. The Marvels, featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. Lightyear, featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. Elemental, featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn't even reach $30 million it's opening week. Now Disney's quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. "It's the beginnings of an unwind," says Cole, "that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success." I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

Title: Blackrock CEO Calls Crypto a ‘Currency of Fear’ (Complimentary)
URL: https://gizmodo.com/blackrock-ceo-calls-crypto-a-currency-of-fear-complimentary-2000553552

Blackrock CEO Larry Fink thinks bitcoin, which is currently priced at around $104,200, could go as high as $700,000. But that’s only if people get really nervous about the stability of their own currencies around the world. And while it’s anyone’s guess whether Fink’s logic is sound and people would indeed flock to crypto in times of crisis (that extremely common thesis hasn’t yet been proved), it’s certainly true that the election of Donald Trump has the potential to inject plenty of instability into the global economic landscape. Fink made the prediction about bitcoin’s future price on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while discussing the outlook of technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency with Bloomberg. Fink had previously been a skeptic of crypto in the late 2010s, saying back in 2017 that, “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” But the billionaire changed his mind in more recent years, becoming a true believer in the promise of crypto by 2021. Fink seems to not only believe that crypto is now a positive thing, but that this reliance on fear is actually an asset. The billionaire thinks people can make a lot of money from instability or at least the worries over instability around the world. “As I became a student of crypto, it was very clear to me that crypto is a currency of fear. And that’s okay,” Fink during the panel Wednesday that’s available on YouTube. Fink was sharing the stage with Peng Xiao, the CEO of AI company G42, who interjected with “to some extent” on Fink’s contention that fear drives bitcoin. But Fink just doubled down on the idea that it was “okay” for bitcoin’s fortunes to rely on fear. “If you’re frightened of your debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of your economic or political stability of your country, you could have an internationally-based instrument called bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument,” said Fink. Fink went on to say that bitcoin’s price could reach “$500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin” while emphasizing “I’m not promoting that, by the way.” Fink also said that he believed bonds and stocks should be “tokenized.” Why? That part isn’t clear, since it makes no fucking sense. But why not? We went through this same bullshit hype cycle a few years ago when everyone jumped on the NFT bandwagon and tokenizing things that didn’t need to be tokenized may very well have another resurgence. “The fact that we are not moving forward in tokenization, every bond and stock is crazy,” said Fink. “We should be moving towards that frontier. Obviously, there’s winners and losers and all that. But we need to be prepared for the tokenization. And it would democratize more finance if we tokenized bonds and stocks.” Fink also discussed the power needs of the enormous data centers that continue to be built around the world to serve the needs of AI. Those data centers require a great amount of power, which Fink addressed by talking about nuclear power as a potential fix. “We need a lot of energy partners to be able to make this a viable global undertaking,” Fink said. “And hopefully this raises a conversation about what role nuclear play in the energy mix.” Fink gave a nod to renewables, saying they would be part of the mix, but said that “unless fusion actually works and we have new sources of power,” there’s a need to work with what’s available. There are some big questions about the future of the U.S. economy that are currently getting hashed out at Davos and beyond. Inflation, for instance, doesn’t seem to be something the ruling class is too scared about anymore, despite the 2024 U.S. presidential election essentially hinging on whether a new president would be able to get prices down. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was asked about Trump’s plans for across the board tariffs against Mexico and Canada, which are expected to get implemented around Feb. 1. And Dimon, who’s worth $2.7 billion, seemed very chill about the prospect. âIf itâs a little inflationary, but itâs good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it,â Dimon told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday. That does sound like a good mantra for the wealthy in this new era of Trump: So be it, get over it. We’re probably going to be hearing that a lot if Trump manages to torpedo the economy. That’s probably not what most Trump supporters thought they were signing up for when they cast a vote for the 47th president. But that’s certainly what they’re going to get.

Title: Has The US Treasury Created An XRP Wallet? Unveiling The Truth

Time Published: 2025-01-22T19:30:37Z

Rumors of the US Treasury’s alleged foray onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have been circulating, sparking buzz across the digital asset community. On January 21, several community accounts on X claimed that an address linked to “home.treasury.gov” had surfaced on the ledger, creating trustlines with well-known financial institutions such as Bank of America, BlackRock, and JPMorgan. However, a deeper look under the hood has uncovered a series of red flags indicating that the wallet in question is neither authentic nor affiliated with the US Treasury. Community member Echo X (@echodatruth), took to X to debunk the rumor through a detailed video breakdown. In the video, he explained that there are many red flags with the wallet. “If you go XRP Scan and you put in the wallet address, you will notice that they have not only just all of these different tokens from Bank of America, BlackRock, and JP Morgan, which again, that’s already a red flag, but you can notice they have 16,000 XRP that has been deposited into this wallet by people just sending it over to the Treasury. Or what they think is the [Treasury].” According to Echo X, any user can easily verify these discrepancies by exploring the wallet on XRPL scanners such as XRPScan or Bithomp. He and other developers from BuildX and the ERS team identified an unusual pattern of newly issued “Bank of America,” “BlackRock,” and “JPMorgan” tokens, all minted by the same address—strong indicators that the tokens are not legitimate. Public data from Bithomp shows that the suspect wallet was activated on January 21 at 3:17 UTC, after which it promptly set its domain to the official US Treasury address, home.treasury.gov—a move observers believe was intended to appear legitimate. Notably, the wallet received 1 trillion units of each of the so-called “Bank of America,” “BlackRock,” and “JPMorgan” tokens, placed multiple sell orders for tens of millions of these tokens in exchange for XRP and used questionable domain references, including an apparently invalid “BRICS domain.” Echo X highlighted that users who looked deeper into the provenance of these tokens would discover their suspicious origins. He noted: “Now, if you actually click on it and you see what the Genesis wallets are … it leads you to a BRICS domain wallet. … That BRICS domain is not even a valid domain. Why would the BRICS be creating a wallet?” Further compounding doubts, data shows the wallet’s trustlines were created around newly issued tokens that hold no official backing. In one notable transaction, the address placed an order to trade 299 million JPMorgan tokens for 33.23 million XRP, at an exchange rate of 0.11 XRP per token, raising more eyebrows about its authenticity. The rumor gained traction when it appeared on XRPScan that the addresses in question had some form of verification tag—an aspect that typically shows that a wallet has completed a Know Your Customer (KYC) process. However, Wietse Wind, founder of Xaman (formerly Xumm), clarified that verification on XRPScan simply indicates whether the account holders have submitted personal data, not that they represent any particular entity. Wind noted via X: “The domain field is a public field on an account on the blockchain, anyone can enter anything there. Issued tokens can be issued by anyone. KYC can be done by anyone. … XRPScan shows data that lives on the ledger. This data lives on the ledger. […] They are all in fact KYC’d. By different people, all from the Philippines. So there we have it. KYC helps, but it’s still no guarantee.” Wind’s remarks underscore that the KYC process is limited to verifying an individual’s identity. It does not confirm that person’s affiliation with an organization, such as the US Treasury or any major bank. Effectively, a user can label a wallet “Treasury,” mint tokens named after financial institutions, and set a domain to a high-profile website without actually representing those entities. In his video, Echo X urged community members to remain vigilant and avoid sending XRP to questionable addresses simply on the basis of domain labels or speculation: “Again, shout out to the BuildX and ERS community and team and developers … because they’re trying to save you. … Make sure you do your own research and know what you hold.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.17 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Could Run to $700,000 if Sovereign Wealth Funds Begin Allocating

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that Bitcoin (BTC) could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating. Speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that sovereign wealth funds may drive the price of Bitcoin higher as they look to hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Fink’s BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin over the last year, building a $50 billion stash to back its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) which went live in early 2024. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,607.

Investing.com -- Speaking to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said he believes Bitcoin could rise to $700,000. Fink said he is a “big believer in the utilization” of Bitcoin as an instrument, explaining that those worried about the debasement of their currencies or the economic or political stability of their countries can have an “internationally based instrument called Bitcoin.” It will “overcome those local fears,” he added. He continued that when speaking with a sovereign wealth fund earlier in the week, the conversation centered on whether they should have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin,” declared Fink. However, he clarified: “I am not promoting it by the way. That is not my promotion.” In December last year it was reported that BlackRock said in a report it recommends investors consider an allocation of as much as 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and payments system make it a potential diversifier,” said Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock. Given its unique value drivers, we see no intrinsic reason why bitcoin should be correlated with major risk assets over the long term,” the BlackRock report stated.

Posted on 01/22/2025 9:29:51 AM PST by Words Matter Curiously, there was a reading from the Koran by Dr. Muhammad Fraser-Rahim, the associate Imam at Masjid Muhammad (The Nation’s Mosque), and the Muslim call to prayer led by Cantor Shayhk Akbar Sharrief, chief mu'adhin of the same mosque. One can understand the desire for inclusivity, but at the same time, Islam makes no bones about its disregard and contempt for other religions, especially Judaism and Christianity. But the formalities must be observed, I suppose. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop ..: Let me make one final plea, Mr. President. Millions have put their trust in you, and as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country, and we're scared now. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children ..Bishop Budde, if LGBTQ people are afraid, it is largely because of the rhetoric that anyone opposed to transgenderism is a proponent of "genocide." You may have missed it, but a fair number of gays and lesbians oppose the transgender movement because of its sexualization of children. Most conservatives I know really don't care what consenting adults do with one another. If you don't believe that, perhaps you should meet more conservatives. There is a whole world outside the echo chamber. .. Will you apologize to the black, Latino, gay, lesbian, Asian, and other people who looked beyond the wild-eyed rhetoric of your compatriots to find common ground with those vile "MAGATS" and who were subjected to all manner of racial and sexual insults, slurs and threats? Will you apologize to Jews in universities and across the nation and admonish those who engaged in violence on behalf of Palestine? (Excerpt) Read more at pjmedia.com ...

Title: Building The Business Case For Growth Investment
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendiorio/2025/01/22/building-the-business-case-for-growth-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T16:08:19Z
Full Content:
A Better Formula For Funding and Executing Commercial Transformation Kristen Carloni leads the global Business Proposal Strategy team for Aladdin Sales and Marketing, a B2B technology business within BlackRock. Her responsibilities center around ensuring an impactful and scalable business proposal process for selling the firm’s financial technology products. From that perch, her team directly impacts the majority of revenues in the business. “The most important, biggest deals come through my team,” says Carloni. “So as a baseline if we don’t do our job the firm is never going to see that revenue, it’s just going to die on the vine.” While Business Proposal Strategy conveys the workings of her job, Kristen’s role defies conventional description. In practice she works across marketing, product, IT and sales functions to leverage technology and AI in ways that help her firm drive faster, more profitable and scalable growth. In other words, she’s a poster child for what is emerging as the next generation of growth leader, a Revenue Operations executive. The description is apt because Kristen is working across silos to better connect teams, data, technology and processes to: 1. Generate more consistent, reliable and profitable revenue growth 2. Improve the return on growth investments in sales, marketing and customer programs 3. Maximize the return on commercial assets like brand, channels, innovation and knowledge assets She’s doing this with a small team of under a dozen people who are impacting over 90 percent of the revenues in the business. At the same time she’s helping the people responsible for the rest of the revenue be more effective in their jobs. And she's in the best position, most importantly, to leverage AI multiplier to drive more scalable revenue growth. A big reason she is so effective is she has adopted the principles and platforms of Strategic Response Management (SRM) which is defined as the people, practice and technology to unlock organizational knowledge for profit growth. Every sales operations, marketing operations, or sales enablement executive can learn a lot from Kristen about creating, quantifying, and communicating the financial impact commercial transformation can have on the business. Why? Because she’s used the principles of Revenue Operations to effectively unlock more of the full potential of the growth investments and assets of her business. And she’s done it from what seems on the surface as a relatively back office “cost center” stuck in the middle of the revenue cycle - the bid and proposal response team. A BETTER BUSINESS CASE FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSFORMATION Generating more consistent and profitable revenue - Unlike typical sales and marketing operations teams, Kristen’s team has the advantage of directly impacting top line revenues. That makes a big difference when it comes to leading commercial transformation in the eyes of leadership. The average B2B response team directly impacts almost one half (48%) of revenues in terms of both customer acquisition (via RFPs) and loyalty and expansion (via Due Diligence Questionnaires) according to APMP benchmarks. They also drive additional revenue by providing market intelligence, self-service knowledgebases, customer insight, and knowledge assets that help improve the overall go-to-market process. As evidence, Carloni’s team has leveraged technology to grow the percent of revenues they directly impact from 70% to 92% of revenues in the past year – with greater productivity, performance and at lower cost. They’ve effectively used the insights and experience drawn from responding to hundreds of customers to inform and improve the efforts of the product, marketing, finance, and sales teams in many ways. Calculating the Probability of winning. Showing where to allocate resources. Identifying the top features customers want. Forecasting future demand 24 months out. Reporting which marketing messages are landing or not. And more. Here are some examples: Improving the return on growth investment. As compelling as these returns are, many sales leaders make the mistake of treating sales productivity as a single solution problem, according to Bob Kelly, the CEO of the Sales Management Association. Instead Kelly advises managers to treat commercial transformation as an equilibrium problem that involves constantly balancing some fundamental tradeoffs such as investing in salesperson up-skilling versus simplifying the selling job; undergoing wholesale transformation versus pursuing incremental process improvements. Kristen Carloni has struck that balance in her efforts to transform the commercial model one dollar at a time at Blackrock. “Our ability to impact sales win rates, productivity, capacity and costs is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the financial impact we’ve delivered when you compare it to the multiplier effect it has had on the return we are getting from our selling assets, IP, and investments,” says Carloni. Academic research reinforces Carloni’s focus on maximizing the return on commercial investments at lower risk. Business leaders that understand the math of growth in a modern business realize that far greater financial impact can be had by managing the allocation and deployment of growth resources, investments and assets such as building customer and brand equity, while mitigating the risks associated with selling. Maximizing the return on commercial assets. Perhaps the biggest financial impact a commercial transformation leader like Carloni can have is to unlock the enormous untapped growth potential of the firms commercial assets. Why? Because the majority of the value in firms is intangible commercial assets – including market-based assets, knowledge assets, computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies like ‘sales know how.’ When properly measured and accounted for, these intangible assets can represent up to 80% or more of the value of a business.
