Title: AVAX Reclaims Top 20 Spot as Securitize Chooses Avalanche for EU Securities Platform

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Avalanche (AVAX) is back in the spotlight after reclaiming its position among the top 20 cryptos to surpass Hedera (HBAR), just as Securitize secures EU approval to launch the region’s first fully regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network. This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. As institutional momentum builds and Europe’s first regulated blockchain securities market goes live on Avalanche, AVAX’s comeback narrative is gaining traction—and a trend reversal may be closer than the charts imply.

Title: Amundi brings euro money market fund onchain with first tokenized share

The asset manager’s hybrid rollout enables investors to choose between the traditional fund and a new blockchain-based version recorded on Ethereum. Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has introduced its first tokenized share class for a euro money market fund. The fund is now offered in a hybrid structure, allowing investors to choose between the traditional version and the new blockchain-based one. The first transaction was recorded on the Ethereum network on Nov. 4. The rollout was developed in collaboration with CACEIS, a European asset-servicing group that provided the tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and the digital order system used to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, tokenizing the fund streamlines order processing, widens access to new investor channels, and enables 24/7 trading. Amundi said the fund holds short-term, high-quality euro-denominated debt, primarily comprising money-market instruments and overnight repurchase agreements with European sovereigns. According to the company’s website, it manages about 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in assets and serves more than 100 million retail clients. Amundi is based in Paris, France.

RWA.xyz data shows BlackRock’s onchain money market product currently holds $2.3 billion in tokenized assets, while Franklin Templeton’s money market fund has more than $826 million in assets. Both funds have been expanding across multiple blockchains. On Nov. 12, Franklin Templeton announced that its tokenization platform joined the Canton Network, enabling its money market fund to operate within a permissioned ecosystem built for financial institutions. BlackRock has also expanded its tokenized fund beyond Ethereum, adding support for Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon. A Bank for International Settlements bulletin released on Wednesday noted that tokenized money market funds had climbed to $9 billion in value by the end of October, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. However, the report warned that the growing adoption of tokenized Treasury portfolios as collateral could expose the financial system to new operational and liquidity vulnerabilities.

Title: Recovery In Sight? Charles Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin Reaching $250,000 By 2026
URL: https://zycrypto.com/recovery-in-sight-charles-hoskinson-sees-bitcoin-reaching-250000-by-2026/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T18:07:26Z
Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has offered a ray of hope to Bitcoin (BTC) holders, tipping the cryptocurrency to recover its yearly losses and set a new all-time high. Hoskinson noted that an imminent Bitcoin rally will send prices all the way to $250,000 before the end of next year. According to a recent interview, Hoskinson revealed that Bitcoin is primed for a recovery run that will see the asset recoup its recent losses in the coming months. The Cardano co-founder disclosed that the largest cryptocurrency is only facing short-term downsides due to macroeconomic pressures. Hoskinson argued that the Bitcoin price has been adversely impacted by Trump tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties, noting that “crypto is not immune to the macro.” Since October, Bitcoin price has tumbled from its peak of over $126,000 to trade below the $90,000 mark, erasing all its yearly gains. Despite the jarring price drops, Hoskinson is eyeing a meteoric rally for Bitcoin “over the next two quarters.” Furthermore, the outspoken Cardano founder tipped Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the end of the year, defying claims of an extended rally. Hoskinson clarified that institutions will lead the incoming bull run, unlike previous retail-led bull markets. He pointed to Wall Street’s growing participation in the ecosystem, with BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and the US government scrambling to accumulate Bitcoin. Apart from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and frenetic adoption by treasury companies, Hoskinson hinged his bullish estimates on the steady rise of stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Hoskinson revealed that retail will still play a key role in the anticipated bull run, with the number of cryptocurrency holders predicted to climb to 1 billion. “The fundamentals are just sound. There is no way for this market to stay depressed forever,” said Hoskinson. They are just reflecting their current macro environment.” Previously, Charles Hoskinson tipped Bitcoin to climb to $1 million but did not disclose a timeline for the milestone. Meanwhile, several experts have made bold calls for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, with the average at $150,000. However, recent price performance has put a dent in end-of-year predictions, with BTC threatening to fall below $85K. While Bitcoin continues its decline, other cryptocurrencies are also facing a torrid patch with Ethereum and XRP wallowing below $3,000 and $2, respectively. BNB, SOL, and DOGE have recorded losses of over 5% over the last day, while Cardano’s ADA tumbled by nearly 8% in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 2.44% to settle at $3.12 trillion.

Title: Bitwise CEO Praises XRP ETF Performance Amid Record-Setting Inflows, Here Are The Numbers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-performance-record/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T16:30:28Z
Full Content:
The launch of XRP exchange-traded funds has quickly turned into one of the strongest openings the crypto ETF market has seen this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley publicly celebrated the early success of his firm’s product, pointing to a surge in investor interest that has driven inflows to nine figures in a couple of days. His comments come at a time when total XRP ETF inflows across the industry are climbing, whereas Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of demand they had in the past. The Bitwise Spot XRP ETF started trading on November 20 after going live based on the new fast-track SEC guidelines for launching ETFs. Since then, the ETF has witnessed consistent days of inflows. Horsley revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF recently recorded roughly $18 million of inflows in one trading session. This huge amount is one of the fund’s strongest days yet and demonstrates that institutional investors are taking active positions rather than waiting on the sidelines. The CEO emphasized gratitude to those allocating capital to Bitwise’s product, describing the inflow strength as a sign of confidence in both XRP as an asset and Bitwise as a manager. “Grateful to investors entrusting Bitwise to steward their asset,” he said. The timing of these inflows also shows the bullish momentum across XRP ETFs, with multiple issuers reporting consistent interest since regulatory approval. This is interesting, considering the spot price of the altcoin has been going through a not-so-favorable period in November. According to Horsley, the Bitwise XRP ETF has now attracted approximately $135 million in inflows over its first three days of trading. This pace places it among the fastest-growing altcoin ETFs launched in the United States, although still behind early-stage numbers associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum products. These inflow numbers show the pent-up demand for institutional-grade exposure to the cryptocurrency. In addition to Bitwise, industry-wide XRP ETF data shows that the new products collectively brought in about $164 million on Monday, October 24. In total, the four US-based ETFs have witnessed $643.92 million in inflows since launch, with no day of outflow yet to be recorded. The strong early adoption contrasts sharply with the hesitation seen among some heavyweight ETF issuers. Firms like BlackRock and FIdelity are yet to launch their own version of a Spot XRP ETF, leaving the current wave of inflows to be dominated by Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. Their absence has not stopped the momentum flowing into XRP, though it has kept the scale of inflows below what it could become once the larger issuers eventually join the field.

Title: Ten decor drops from legacy raids and dungeons to pick up on Player Housing day one

NEXT | How to win the World Championship Hearthstone Tavern Brawl Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Real-World Utility, Not Meme Coin Mania, Will Drive Crypto’s Next Wave
URL: https://observer.com/2025/11/next-crypto-boom-stablecoins-adoption/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T15:00:18Z

For years, crypto has resembled a casino, with flashy trends, wild price spikes and meme coins stealing the spotlight. But beneath the noise, something very different is taking shape in the middle of this so-called bear market. The next major leap in digital assets is unlikely to be fueled by the latest meme coin or a fleeting trading frenzy. Instead, it will be powered by real-world applications and the development of durable, institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the industry evolves, a substantial shift in investment and engineering resources is underway. The focus is moving away from speculative”casino” behavior and toward more functional, enduring applications: everyday global payments, banking services built on stablecoins and the seamless integration of tokenization into traditional financial systems. This transition will mark the true maturation of the parallel financial system. A recent TRM Labs adoption report revealed that India, the United States, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil are now leading global digital asset usage. South Asia is also the fastest-growing crypto market in 2025. The next significant advancement in digital assets probably won’t be driven by a new meme coin or a temporary surge in trading activity. Crucially, the research shows that stablecoins accounted for approximately 30 percent of all on-chain activity, with total transaction volume rising above $4 trillion between January and July 2025, marking an 83 percent year-over-year increase. That isn’t the profile of a market anticipating the next viral trend. It’s the profile of a parallel payments and settlement layer taking shape. The last big boom was fueled by meme coins and quick-hit trading crazes. That era brought millions of newcomers into crypto, but it also cemented the perception of the industry as a digital gambling hall. Today’s landscape looks markedly different. Significant liquidity is now flowing through crypto spot ETFs. Stablecoin activity is at an all-time high. Tokenization markets are expanding. Serious capital is staying in the system, not just passing through for a quick bet. At the same time, hype-driven projects with no real utility beyond speculation are being flushed out. What’s emerging instead is infrastructure and applications designed for populations regularly excluded from traditional banking systems. One of the strongest indicators of this adoption-driven future lies in the emergence of a new class of financial institutions. For over a decade, neobanks were heralded as the future of finance, despite most remaining deeply tied to legacy rails, from know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and custody models to payment networks and physical card issuance. They did little for the 1.4 billion people who remain unbanked, and they still left users exposed to arbitrary account freezes and the same opaque systems that defined traditional banking. A new category, known as decentralized on-chain baking platforms, or deobanks, is taking the opposite approach. Instead of layering a sleek interface over incumbents, these platforms are building upward from blockchain infrastructure itself. Here, self-custodial accounts are connected through smart contracts, giving users real control over their assets, unlike the temporary permissions granted on a centralized bank ledger. These accounts also operate on stablecoin-native infrastructure, enabling cross-border transfers to settle in minutes and eliminating SWIFT fees and correspondent banking delays. Moreover, loyalty and governance are directly linked to network participation, rather than being obscured by unclear “points” programs. Critics point to new risks from key management challenges to smart contract exploits to uneven regulatory oversight. And while those concerns are valid, they also overlook that these systems offer meaningful benefits to millions who lack reliable access to savings, credit or affordable international payments. And this is where stablecoins change the story. This new infrastructure is paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption, where digital assets are used for everyday payments, not just speculative bets. As noted, stablecoin use has shot up considerably, with TRM Labs reporting that they now account for nearly one-third of all on-chain activity. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape around them is shifting in ways that legitimize these assets. The U.S. recently enacted its first comprehensive legislation for fiat-backed tokens known as the GENIUS Act. The E.U.’s MiCA regulations are now in effect, and Hong Kong, along with other major financial hubs, has introduced dedicated frameworks for these assets. These developments are now making it possible for banks, payment processors and fintech companies to integrate with crypto infrastructure without the regulatory paralysis of prior years. They are also reshaping real-world incentives, making remittances from workers in the Gulf, Europe or North America to relatives in South Asia, Africa and Latin America, not only cheaper, but almost instant. With trillions of dollars flowing through stablecoins each year—and clear legal recognition emerging in major markets—they are becoming far more than payment novelties. Given that 90 percent of them are pegged to the U.S. dollar, these assets are now functioning as an alternative settlement layer for the dollar itself. As money increasingly flows through this system, a tipping point will arrive: an infrastructure strong enough to shape the next chapter of global finance. It’s become very difficult to believe that the next bull run will still be driven by the old question: Which coin will be 100x? Instead, it is far more likely to be driven by the networks processing the next trillion dollars in real-world payments. And because crypto is shedding its identity as a discrete asset class and becoming part of the invisible infrastructure behind everyday payment transactions, that shift may arrive sooner than expected. Two trends are powering this transition: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the emergence of decentralized banks. Today, roughly $35.6 billion in RWAs is tokenized, with market-maker Keyrock projecting the figure will reach $50 billion by the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also outlined a plan to unlock up to $4 trillion in digital wallet-held assets around the world through the digitization of traditional financial products—a signal of how large this market may grow. Deobanks, meanwhile, bring stablecoin payments and self-custody to the mainstream while layering in credit, savings and rewards. They allow users to bypass legacy intermediaries and plug directly into blockchain settlement rails. In such an ecosystem, liquidity can no longer depend on speculative waves. It will come from continuous flows: remittances, payroll, supplier payments, trade finance and tokenized fixed-income products. At that point, market cycles will sit on top of a growing base of structural demand, not narrative-driven inflows. Ultimately, it is this structural foundation that will determine how far any future bull market can run. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock ETF investors bounce back to profit as price reclaims $90K

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investors are back in profit, in a promising sign of a December market recovery from the cohort that drove much of Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs in 2025. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders are back in profit after Bitcoin’s recovery above $90,000, an early sign that sentiment may be turning among one of the key investor groups driving the market this year. The holders of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) fund, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), bounced back to a cumulative profit of $3.2 billion on Wednesday, according to blockchain data platform Arkham. “BlackRock IBIT and ETHA holders went from being up almost a combined $40 billion at their PnL peak on 7th October, down to $630 million 4 days ago,” wrote Arkham in a Wednesday X post. “This means the average of all BlackRock ETF buys is at just about break-even.” With ETF holders no longer under pressure, Bitcoin ETFs may continue to slow their selling rate, which has seen a significant improvement since the $903 million in outflows recorded on Nov. 20. Bitcoin ETFs recorded two consecutive days of inflows for the first time in two weeks, with a modest $21 million in cumulative inflows on Wednesday, according to Farside Investors.The development is a welcome sign for Bitcoin, as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was the only fund to realize net positive inflows for 2025, according to K33 Research. The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management firm, with $13.5 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2025.Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say The broader spot Bitcoin ETF investor cohort is also back in profit after Bitcoin climbed above the key $89,600 flow-weighted cost basis, a level that was lost two weeks ago.Bitcoin’s recovery follows a sharp increase in interest rate cut expectations for the US Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, with odds increasing by 46% in a week. Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut, up from 39% a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Related: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined Two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s price correction pushed Bitcoin ETF holders below their flow-weighted cost basis near $89,600, according to Glassnode analyst Sean Rose, with the average holder facing paper losses on their investment. However, most ETF holders are “long-term allocators,” meaning that “being underwater doesn’t trigger quick exits,” Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph.

Title: One-Third of Rich Young Clients Move Money Over Lack of Crypto Access: Report

Institutional wealth managers might lose young crypto investors due to the absence of digital asset offerings, a new survey shows. Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) became more intertwined with mainstream firms as users backed on-chain use-cases. A new survey conducted by crypto payment firm ZeroHash highlights the growing adoption of digital asset offerings, especially among young investors. Participants indicated that they are willing to change wealth managers because exposure to crypto assets is not on the table. About a third of investors are in search of crypto offerings supporting the position. More practically, over 50% of participants said they moved between $250,000 and $1 million in search of crypto products. This shows the skyrocketing demand for digital assets and recent institutional investments in the market. Meanwhile, 18% of young investors pulled out less than $100k from funds with virtual assets, and 5.3% transferred over $1 million. The majority claim their stance was influenced by heavy institutional accumulation in recent months. According to the survey, if large institutional firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, etc are increasing exposure to crypto, smaller investors should follow a similar path. Meanwhile, 84% of investors said they plan to increase their crypto holdings in the next 12 months. This adoption spike is expected after crypto assets like Bitcoin tapped all-time highs this year, with analysts tipping a bull case of $1 million by 2030. Short-term projections suggest a run above $150k despite recent setbacks triggered by mass liquidations. Crypto users became more bullish after the United States’ positive stance, prompting a surge in institutional demand. Most young investors now feel confident about the market’s future. Previously, several institutional giants refused to include virtual assets in their portfolios, citing concerns about manipulation. “Crypto assets have become essential to modern portfolio strategy with users not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up… Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the report added. Furthermore, 92% of participants say a broader range of crypto-based investment products is required, a move away from the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings. This year, altcoins like Solana and XRP recorded consecutive inflows into institutional products as the market awaits spot ETFs and more decentralized finance use cases.

Title: Aramco selects Citigroup for oil storage terminals stake sale

Saudi Aramco has selected Citigroup to advise on the planned sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals business, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The appointment follows a competitive process involving several major investment banks, with Citigroup emerging as the preferred adviser in recent days. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more Previously, the company mandated JPMorgan Chase as a sell-side adviser for separate sales of stakes in its oil and gas pipeline infrastructure. The proposed transaction could raise several billion dollars for Aramco, although discussions remain at an early stage. No final decisions have been made regarding the structure or timing of the sale, according to the report. The Saudi energy company is expected to begin a formal sale process next year, which may attract interest from large infrastructure funds. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This move aligns with its broader strategy to divest assets, including parts of its real estate portfolio, as it seeks to generate capital for future investments. Aramco’s oil storage and export network includes major facilities at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and terminals on the Red Sea. The company owns interests in product terminals in the Netherlands and holds leases for crude and product storage in Egypt and Okinawa, Japan. Bloomberg said that Aramco’s decision to explore the sale of a stake in the oil terminals business comes as the company responds to changing market conditions. Oil prices have declined by around 16% this year, prompting the company to delay some projects and consider asset sales to maintain investment capacity. While the impact on earnings has been offset by increased production, asset sales are considered a means to strengthen Aramco’s financial position. Citigroup declined Bloomberg’s request to comment on the appointment, and Aramco did not immediately respond to requests for comment, without disclosing further details of the stake sale. In September this year, a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, was reportedly in negotiations with several banks to secure up to $10.3bn (SR38.62bn) in financing for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development deal. JPMorgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are said to be among the financial institutions in discussions to support the transaction.

Title: Nasdaq seeks SEC nod to lift IBIT options cap to one million contracts

BTC’s V-shaped recovery meets Nasdaq’s IBIT options expansion. IBIT options expansion provides 40× more room for Bitcoin derivatives exposure, boosting liquidity, but persistent market fear raises questions. BTC is showing a V-shaped recovery, reclaiming $92k, but full reversal is still uncertain as options leverage peaks and resistance levels loom. The Q4 market cycle is prompting investors to reconsider the “store of value” narrative. From DATs losing purchasing power to ETFs bleeding cash, and big institutions selling to protect their balance sheets, Bitcoin [BTC] conviction is being tested. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are a clear example. According to BitBo, the firm has offloaded roughly 30,000 BTC since the October crash. And it’s not just their direct holdings. BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) logged more than $3 billion in outflows in November alone. Source: BitBo In short, institutional conviction in BlackRock took a hit this cycle. Yet, the latest Nasdaq–SEC filing looks like an attempt to reboot momentum around IBIT. According to the filing, Nasdaq wants to raise IBIT’s options contract limit from 25k to 1 million, marking a 400% jump. Simply put, that’s 40× more room for derivatives exposure in Bitcoin, putting IBIT in the same conversation as the “Magnificent Seven” in terms of options depth. But the question is: Is the timing right? BTC has bounced back to $90k, yet “fear” still dominates the market. ETFs haven’t fully rebounded either. In this context, does Nasdaq’s move give IBIT room for serious derivatives flows, or is it just another high-risk trade? The market reaction to the news is clear on the charts. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s Options Open Interest (OI) jumped about $4 billion in a single day, hitting $62 billion. That’s a clear sign derivatives activity is picking up, likely boosted by the expanded IBIT options limits. The impact on Bitcoin? Pretty clear. BTC is riding the bullish momentum from yesterday’s 3.51% rally, trying to reclaim the $92k level. In fact, this marks BTC’s first V-shaped recovery in nearly a month. Source : TradingView (BTC/USDT) However, a full reversal isn’t on the cards yet. In early November, BTC failed to break the $110k ceiling, forming two lower lows, the latest around $80k. In this context, breaking $94k would be the first step toward a vertical expansion. Meanwhile, options leverage is heating up, while the SEC has yet to rule on the IBIT filing. Still, the market’s reaction is already evident. As BTC nears resistance, how this leverage plays out will serve as a crucial gauge for traders. If BTC holds above current levels, the 1 million contract expansion could pave the way for deeper liquidity. Otherwise, excessive leverage could make BTC prone to volatility, turning the expansion into a high-risk trade.

Title: Kevin Hassett tipped as next Fed Chair, markets eye dollar impact

U.S. bond markets remain steady despite speculation that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair in May. Hassett’s reputation for favoring rate cuts has sparked concerns that the dollar could weaken. Betting markets show rising odds for Hassett, while short-term yields dipped briefly before rebounding. (Source: Reuters) The dollar and Fed funds futures have seen minimal impact, even as investors price in an 83% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in December. Hassett, a former Fed senior economist, is considered aligned with President Trump, who favors faster reductions in interest rates. The market reaction may be muted because Hassett was already seen as the frontrunner. The field of candidates for the Fed chair has narrowed to a handful of finalists. These include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. On betting site Polymarket, Hassett’s odds have risen to 53%, Waller holds 22%, and Warsh is at 16%. Investors largely discount any risk to Fed independence, regardless of who takes the helm. Experts emphasize that the chair guides the committee, but the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee ultimately decides on rates. The path of interest rates will continue to depend heavily on fresh U.S. economic data, including labor reports and the administration’s trade and tariff policies. Kevin Hassett may be seen as less independent compared to other candidates, which creates some risk to the dollar and the Treasury yield curve. However, his traditional economics background could limit aggressive dovish moves. Experts caution that Hassett would likely not fully align with political pressures, even if he favors rate cuts more than Powell. The Fed eased rates by a quarter percentage point in both September and October, leaving the Fed funds rate at 3.75–4%. Hassett previously supported a “slow and steady” approach to rate cuts and emphasized that Fed policy must remain independent of political influence. Analysts believe fears of a politicized Fed are overdone, noting Hassett would struggle to push the committee toward aggressive dovishness.

Title: Americans in Ireland think of home at Thanksgiving: ‘There are troubled times over there’

One American couple’s “most memorable” Thanksgiving was when they got caught up in the Dublin riots this time two years ago while out for dinner. Tania Etter from Pennsylvania and her husband Marcus from San Francisco moved to Dublin seven years ago as part of his job. Thanksgiving, which Americans – including those living in Ireland – celebrate today, is his favourite holiday. “American holidays are very commercialised whereas there’s nothing about Thanksgiving other than eat, drink, family and sport,” he says. Thanksgiving has nothing of the “pretentiousness” of other holidays, he adds. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and dates back to 1621 when European settlers, or Pilgrims as they were known, were having trouble growing enough food. Native Americans taught them how to grow crops and the Pilgrims invited them to a feast as a thank-you. The couple were attending a Thanksgiving event with other Americans when the riots broke out in November 2023 and they couldn’t get home. “We walked south of Ranelagh before we finally found a taxi man who we could convince to take us home,” he recalled. “It was an adventure,” added Ms Etter. [ Meet the Americans moving to Ireland for a better lifeOpens in new window ] They have a tradition of putting messages in a stuffed animal known as Terry the Thanksgiving turkey that sits as a table centrepiece. Family and friends write messages of what they are thankful for. The messages become the tail feathers and after dinner, the turkey is plucked and messages read aloud. Marcus is thankful for his Irish citizenship which he received this year and their recent move to their home in Blackrock, south Dublin. “I just went back to America for the first time in four years for our business trip. I can absolutely and unequivocally say I do not miss it,” he said. He misses his family at home but Teams and Zoom calls make it “easier”. This year they will celebrate with a pre-prepared meal at home with their dogs. The Late Late Toy Show has become one of their holiday season traditions. “Our view is you can’t just be American and hold on to all your Americanisms. You’re living in a new culture, a new world, a new society, you need to adopt that.” Molly Coyle Shibley moved to Ireland in 2019. She is grateful to live here but feels “guilty” for family still in the US. Originally from Massachusetts, Coyle Shibley settled in Rathfarnham, south Dublin with her husband Tom while pregnant with their first child Nora after he was offered a job in Dublin. “I’m very grateful to be in Ireland for different reasons every year,” she said. “Last year, we bought a house. This year my husband and daughter’s citizenship applications were approved and I’m applying for mine.” Ms Shibley celebrates with the same group of friends every year. “They have seen my daughter grow up, they’re my family away from home.” Margie O’Rourke has been living in Ireland since 1987 and settled in St Margaret’s in north Dublin, where her husband, who she met in her hometown of Philadelphia, is from. “The major thing with Thanksgiving is family so it’s a weird experience being away from family,” she said. “Most people here are completely unaware it’s Thanksgiving.” She is thankful for her good health and that of her husband and family, and grateful for friends and little things like “the green grass and a cup of tea”. “It took me 10 years to settle here but life is good. There are troubled times over there [in the US],” she said. “Thanksgiving – it’s tradition and it’s part of me.” [ US students drawn to Ireland struck by hard realities of rental marketOpens in new window ] © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The filing, dated November 21, 2025, seeks to raise the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. It would place IBIT options in the same tier as major equities and ETFs such as Apple, NVIDIA, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. “The proposed rule change seeks to dramatically increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts,” the filing reads, adding the current cap is “restrictive and hampers legitimate trading and hedging strategies.” A higher limit would allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. "This will allow institutions to build more interesting structured products for IBIT, increasing the total possible amount of capital that can be allocated to the Bitcoin ETFs," Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, told Decrypt. "This should be good for long-term IBIT flows." “This is already the second time Nasdaq has requested an increase in IBIT’s options position limits,” Tim Sun, Senior Researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. The move showcases that institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives continues to expand as larger players seek to increase their Bitcoin allocations, Sun added. The filing requests an exemption to eliminate limits entirely for customized 'FLEX' options that are physically delivered. This move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets,” per the filing. It also cites IBIT's market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025, as key factors supporting the proposed change. The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, with a public comment period open until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a Wednesday tweet. “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here,” Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors tweeted on Wednesday. The scale of this change is “more modest than most headlines suggest,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. With BlackRock holding over $71 billion in Bitcoin, the increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs," Lim added. While the changes have yet to take effect, the adjustment signals that Bitcoin trading is shifting from purely speculative to allocation-driven behavior, the HashKey analyst noted. Despite no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, Sun explained it would allow institutions to build Bitcoin positions in a “lower-risk and more controlled manner.” From a volatility standpoint, Lim noted that realized volatility is likely to compress 50 to 100 basis points over the next six to 18 months, which “can translate to marginally higher prices through lower risk premia.” Bitcoin’s rally from $70,000 to $110,000 earlier this year occurred amid declining volatility. That negative correlation marks a fundamental shift, Lim noted, suggesting that if the Nasdaq’s proposed changes come into effect, Bitcoin will increasingly trade like a macro asset and would accelerate this transition. In a related development, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Bitcoin hit $91,500 on Wednesday and is up 5% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

The push from the Nasdaq to increase option limits for the BlackRock Bitcoin fund shows Bitcoin markets are “breaking out of their training wheels.” The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the position limits for options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund to 1 million. Position limits exist to prevent any one investor from controlling too many option contracts on the same stock, thereby reducing the risk of manipulative schemes that could affect prices, according to the notice and copy of the filing from the SEC on Wednesday. The Nasdaq has requested in its Nov. 13 filing to increase the BlackRock ETF limit from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, as the exchange has seen an ongoing increase in demand for IBIT. A lower limit would impede trading activity and the strategies of investors, such as the use of effective hedging vehicles or an income-generating strategy. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, said the SEC is likely to approve the proposal because “these adjustments are routine once an asset proves it can handle real volume. If approved, expect thicker order books, tighter spreads, and a more efficient options market.” Nasdaq previously filed to raise the limit from 25,000 to 250,000 in January because IBIT was well above the trading volume minimum of 100 million shares. Liu said this current push from the Nasdaq to “super-size IBIT option limits shows Bitcoin markets breaking out of their training wheels.” Related: S&P downgrades USDT’s dollar peg rating to lowest score “Bigger bands mean bigger players can finally hedge, size up, and sharpen price discovery. A clear sign that crypto derivatives are shifting from niche to necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, Adam Livingston, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and author, said in a series of X posts on Wednesday that the move by Nasdaq places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF into the same category as the “largest, most liquid equities on Earth,” such as tech giants Apple and Microsoft. “They did it because the market has already decided Bitcoin is a mega-cap asset, whether Washington likes it or not. This is the moment every banker secretly feared,” he said.

Title: XRP Steps Into Its ETF Moment — Analyst Is Betting On A Rally Bigger Than Bitcoin’s

As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and evolves, a new narrative is gaining traction that positions XRP for an upcoming institutional-driven surge that could redefine market expectations. With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as it pushes back above $2.20. If the move continues, XRP could reach the $3.00 region. Overall, opportunities have continued to emerge across major altcoins.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ethereum ETFs pull $175mln in two days, yet ETH stays weak — What’s wrong?

Is the market sleepwalking into a major surprise? On 24 November, ETH ETFs saw $96.6 million in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $92.6 million. On 25 November, ETH ETFs added another $78.6 million. RSI and MACD point to a short-term bearish trend, but these signals may be temporary noise rather than long-term weakness. At a time when the market is buzzing with new altcoin ETF launches, Ethereum’s quiet yet powerful momentum is being overlooked. The world’s largest altcoin ETF – the Ethereum Spot ETF – has been steadily gaining strength ever since it debuted in the same year as the historic Bitcoin [BTC] ETF rollout. And the latest numbers show that investor confidence in Ethereum [ETH] is far from fading. On the 24th of November, Ethereum Spot ETFs logged a strong $96.6 million in net inflows, with BlackRock alone accounting for $92.6 million, marking its first inflow in two weeks. Well, the momentum didn’t stop there. A day later, ETH ETFs attracted another $78.6 million, led by Fidelity’s FETH with $47.5 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA at $46.2 million, and Grayscale’s ETH adding $8.3 million. While most other issuers recorded zero activity, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to face pressure, witnessing $23.3 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. However, despite the strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the asset itself continues to battle a difficult price environment. At the time the latest ETF inflows were recorded, Ethereum was trading around $2,913.41, still unable to reclaim the $3,000 mark after falling more than 30% in a month, according to CoinMarketCap. This weakness stood in sharp contrast to the asset’s price action when ETH ETFs first went live on the 23rd of July 2024, when Ethereum closed at $3,418.61. But the current struggle isn’t about Ethereum alone. The broader crypto market has been under pressure due to a mix of macro events, including a U.S. government shutdown, shifting expectations around Fed rate cuts, and overall risk-off sentiment. Technical indicators also reflect this short-term turbulence. In fact, the RSI and MACD point toward a bearish phase, though these signals could be temporary noise rather than signs of a deeper structural shift. Source: Trading View Interestingly, this period of weakness has actually pulled major Ethereum whales back into the market. After ETH rebounded nearly 9% from its recent low of $2,623, whales became noticeably active again, breaking a month-long downtrend. On-chain data showed dormant wallets suddenly moving large amounts of ETH. Now, while Ethereum battles its own volatility, the broader ETF race is heating up. In a fresh development, VanEck has filed for a Spot Binance [BNB] ETF. According to recent SEC filings, the VanEck BNB ETF (VBNB) will list on Nasdaq and hold BNB directly, tracking the MarketVector BNB Index. The fund will not enable staking at launch, though VanEck noted that any future staking features would be handled through third-party providers with prior notice. This announcement landed just as BNB traded at $857.52, posting a mild 0.57% gain in 24 hours but still down more than 25% over the past month, a pattern driven by the same macro pressures affecting Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market.

Title: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) is holding firm around the $2,900 level as improving macro sentiment, renewed whale accumulation, and rising ETF inflows strengthen expectations for a short-term rebound toward $3,400. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

Title: Nasdaq ISE proposes to raise BlackRock IBIT options trading limits from 250,000 to 1 million

Share this article Nasdaq ISE, LLC (ISE) has proposed rule amendments to increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. The fund, managed by BlackRock, provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. IBIT was approved for options trading on the ISE last September. The exchange states that IBIT’s current 250,000-contract cap has become restrictive, given the rapid growth in options demand for IBIT during 2025. Increasing the limits would support greater hedging efficiency, facilitate income-generating option strategies, and allow market makers to provide deeper liquidity. The increased limits reflect surging institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF options as Wall Street expands its crypto trading operations. Nasdaq operates as a major stock exchange and has been adapting its infrastructure to accommodate growing institutional interest in crypto derivatives. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora

Brad Lander has recommended three of the city’s five pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, the trustee and fiduciary for the city’s five pension funds, recommended that three of the funds drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management because the asset managers have “inadequate decarbonization plans.” BlackRock, which manages $42.3 billion worth of index funds for the pension funds, as well as Fidelity and PanAgora, were found to have “failed to meet the systems’ climate expectations,” Lander said in a statement. Lander, who is leaving office on January 1 at the end of his term, said Wednesday he has updated the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan for the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. In the update, Lander recommended that the three pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates and terminate those of active managers Fidelity and PanAgora. The comptroller made the recommendation after an evaluation of the pension funds’ 49 public-market managers. While 46 of the systems’ public-market managers submitted decarbonization plans that meet the requirements of the Net Zero Implementation Plans, the three asset managers failed to meet the pension funds’ climate expectations. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The trustees of NYCERS, TRS and BERS adopted net zero implementation plans in 2023, in which they committed their funds to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040, according to Lander. This includes committing the funds to interim targets and to disclosing emissions; engaging asset managers and portfolio companies to adopt net-zero policies; investing in climate change solutions; and divesting to lower risk, according to information Lander released. According to the comptroller’s office, the pension funds collectively have reduced financed greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 2019, divested from fossil fuel reserve owners, and grew their climate-related investments to $11.9 billion, while registering a 10.5% return for fiscal 2025 that beat its actuarial target by 350 basis points. “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said in a statement. “I am calling on my fellow trustees to move our money away from the three asset managers—BlackRock, Fidelity, and PanAgora—who fail to address climate risk with the seriousness we expect.” Lander said that after the administration of President Donald Trump changed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s requirements that public companies must disclose climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions, BlackRock ended engaging with U.S. companies on proxy voting issues in situations when the manager owns at least a 5% share. Because of the disengagement, Lander said BlackRock “does not sufficiently encourage portfolio companies to take concrete decarbonization actions.” Although BlackRock expanded access to its climate and decarbonization stewardship policy, it still fails to meet the pension funds’ expectations, according to Lander. The comptroller’s office also alleged that Fidelity has taken an “overly restrictive” interpretation of SEC guidance for companies in the U.S. and abroad to prevent influencing them about decarbonization, “even when such action is financially material.” Due to this, Lander is recommending that TRS terminate Fidelity’s world ex-U.S. small-cap mandate and reallocate its $384 million in assets away from firm. Additionally, Lander said investment firm PanAgora’s climate-related engagement only concerns disclosing emissions and “fails to encourage companies to take decarbonization actions,” such as setting emissions targets or adopting transition plans. As a result, Lander recommended that NYCERS and TRS drop PanAgora’s U.S. small-cap equity mandate. BlackRock, in a response to Lander posted on social media, stated that the firm had met earlier in November with the New York City Bureau of Asset Management, which houses the pension funds’ investment team, and updated BAM on the firm’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. BlackRock’s response also accused the outgoing Lander of “politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” BlackRock also noted that any changes to the pension funds’ investment mandates would require review by the funds’ boards, the BAM investment team and other stakeholders. “Should they take up your recommendation, we look forward to demonstrating the breadth and depth of our capabilities and the tremendous value we deliver,” wrote BlackRock’s Armando Senra, managing director and head of its Americas institutional business. Responses from Fidelity and PanAgora were not immediately available.

Title: Tokenized money market funds surge to $9B, BIS warns of new risks

Onchain money market funds have grown nearly 10-fold since 2023, but the Bank for International Settlements warns their adoption brings new liquidity and contagion risks. Tokenized money market funds are emerging as one of the most important yield-bearing assets on public blockchains, offering money-market returns and securities-level protections that stablecoins can’t provide, according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the bulletin, tokenized money market funds now hold nearly $9 billion in assets, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. The BIS warned that as these tokenized Treasury portfolios become a key source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem, they also bring new operational and liquidity risks. Tokenized money market funds are blockchain-based representations of traditional money market portfolios, providing investors with onchain access to short-term, interest-bearing assets, such as US Treasurys. The BIS noted that while these tokens offer the flexibility of stablecoins, they depend on permissioned wallets, offchain market plumbing and a small set of large holders; factors that could accelerate stress if redemptions spike or onchain liquidity thins out. Although the tokens move on public blockchains, the underlying portfolios, pricing and settlement still occur in traditional markets. BIS says that gap creates a structural mismatch: token transfers settle instantly, while the assets behind them do not. During periods of heavy withdrawals, this gap may make it more challenging for funds to meet redemptions without contributing to further volatility. Interlinkages with stablecoins create additional risk, as some tokenized money market funds also enable rapid conversions into stablecoins or are used for leveraged trades. The BIS warns that these feedback loops could allow market stress to spread much faster than in traditional money market funds. The analysis was released just a day after the institution appointed International Monetary Fund chief and CBDC backer Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli as the next head of its Innovation Hub. Related: Tokenized money market funds emerge as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins The world’s top asset managers have been accelerating the expansion of tokenized money market funds across multiple blockchain networks. Franklin Templeton announced on Nov. 12 the integration of its Benji tokenization platform with the Canton Network, bringing tokenized assets — including its onchain US government money market fund — into a blockchain ecosystem designed for financial institutions. Asset manager BlackRock also recently announced the expansion of its tokenized money market fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon, broadening beyond Ethereum. RWA.xyz data shows that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) currently dominates the onchain money market landscape, with more than $2.5 billion in tokenized assets. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund has over $844 million in tokenized US government securities, according to the data.

Airship AI’s (NASDAQ: AISP) Q4 stock price correction is not without cause, but it is overdone, setting up a buying opportunity for investors. The quality of the opportunity is highlighted by the insider activity, which was bullish in November. Two insiders, including director and CEO Victor Huang, bought shares late in the month, shortly after its Q3 earnings report triggered a sudden downdraft. The earnings report is a concern for this emerging tech stock. However, the miss is due to one-offs, including the impact of Trump’s administration change, downsizing government staff, and the government shutdown. The takeaway is that the shutdown compounded slowdowns in the approval and payment process, impacting AISP's business. The details that matter include the backlog, pipeline, and expected spending increases tied to the Big Beautiful Bill. It contains billions in funding for border security and other security and defense needs that Airship AI is positioned to meet. Insider purchases are significant because these executives did not need to buy shares to indicate their support. CEO Victor Huang is reported to own as much as 12% of the stock through personal and various family holdings, while total insider exposure ranges from 30% to 40%. The company has a $166 million pipeline connected to a single government client, expected to close in 18-24 months. This is projected to enable over 1000% revenue growth compared to the 2025 forecast. The sell-side activity, including short selling, analysts, and institutions, has this market set up for volatility. The analysts’ coverage is virtually nil, indicating no support from that vector: coverage by a half dozen analysts lapsed over the last year, and the most recent update isn’t good. Weiss Ratings pegged the stock as a Sell, although it did not provide a price target; this rating was still sufficient to exacerbate the Q4 downdraft, given the high short interest. Short interest is running near 20% as of mid-November and is likely to remain high until a potent catalyst emerges. When it does, it could trigger a short-squeeze. The good news is that institutions are buying. The ownership is still light at roughly 6% but it is rising, and buying activity is robust. The pace in 2025 is about $3 bought for each $1 sold and will likely remain favorable for the foreseeable future. Buyers include a wide range of institutions, including mutual fund and ETF managers such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and Russell Investments Group. Airship AI is included in several Russell indices, including the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000. While dilution played a role in AISP’s stock price headwind, the threat is diminished in December. The exercise of warrants after the quarter’s end raised approximately $9 million in capital, positioning the company well for the upcoming year. The resulting $15.5 million in cash on the balance sheet is sufficient for several years of operation at the Q3 cash burn rate, ample time to get it over the line to profitability. The bad news is that AISP’s share price is rangebound. That said, the Q4 sell-off put the market at the range bottom, and a rebound is already building. The insider buys triggered a positive market response, driving the price up by more than 15% the following week. Assuming the market picks up on the signal, AISP could continue rising in December. The risk is that short-sellers will continue to sell into the rallies, capping gains Thomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for InsiderTrades.com since 2019.

Title: Central banks warn DeFi and $9bn tokenised money-market funds jeopardise global finance

About us Copy link Tokenised money-market funds have ballooned to a $9 billion crypto market sector, but what looks like quiet progress has got the Bank for International Settlements sounding early risk warnings. Analysts at the Basel-based global forum of central banks and the Collegio Carlo Alberto, a research institute, said that, despite their digital packaging, these crypto funds remain exposed to traditional money-market tensions, according to a report published on Wednesday. Tokenised money-market funds are just like their traditional counterparts: they allow investors to earn yield on cash instruments directly on-chain. “Tokenised money-market funds give rise to risks that mirror and may even amplify those found in conventional money market funds and stablecoins,” the report stated. The analysts said decentralised finance integration may heighten market stresses through leverage and interconnected protocols, or what industry proponents call composability. Given the tight coupling between such funds and stablecoins, market shocks could spread more quickly and cause greater damage than in traditional markets. The warning comes as tokenised money-market funds surge alongside crypto’s broader expansion into real-world assets, a trend that even the BIS sees as a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the digital asset market. Tokenised money-market funds grew 265% in the last year, according to data from RWA.xyz. And the sector could grow to $250 billion in the next three years, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted in October. Even as it sounded the alarm, the BIS said these crypto products may become a backbone of the global financial system, given their growth and rising institutional interest. Traditional finance juggernauts like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Swiss Bank UBS are some of the institutional players in the tokenised money market sector. But with this growth potential comes the need for proactive measures to curtail market risks before they harden into systemic threats that could upend both the crypto and traditional markets, the report stated.

Title: Grayscale files with SEC to list Zcash ETF

The fund, which could be listed on NYSE Arca, would be the first ETF tied to a privacy coin, following several other listings from Grayscale and asset managers. Grayscale is aiming to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund in a move that could mark one of the first investment vehicles linked to a privacy coin. In a Wednesday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Grayscale submitted a Form S-3 registration statement, signaling its intention to convert its fund tied to Zcash (ZEC) into a spot ETF. The move followed Grayscale’s launch of other spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP (XRP). The simplified form with the regulator could allow Grayscale to list the Zcash ETF on the NYSE Arca. According to data from Nansen, the price of ZEC increased by more than 50% in the past 30 days and by 1,050% in the past 12 months, reaching $519.62 at the time of publication. Since the SEC initially approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, several asset management companies, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and others, have expanded their offerings to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale debuted the first spot DOGE ETF this week, which saw $1.4 million in volume on Monday. Related: NYSE approves Grayscale DOGE and XRP ETFs, clearing launch for Monday Earlier this month, Leap Therapeutics said it would use a $50 million investment from Winklevoss Capital, the venture capital firm founded by Gemini creators Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to acquire ZEC tokens as part of its cryptocurrency treasury strategy. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas later argued on social media that the privacy coin could essentially pull support away from Bitcoin, though many users were skeptical of his claims.

Title: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.

Title: Why Texas is buying Bitcoin from BlackRock before building a real reserve

Operational challenges prompt Texas's strategic use of an ETF as a temporary measure while building sovereign-grade custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Texas has taken the first formal step toward becoming the first US state to hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. On Nov. 25, Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, reported that the world’s eighth-largest economy, valued at $2.7 trillion, purchased $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. He added that a second $5 million allocation is already lined up for direct Bitcoin acquisition once the state finalizes a custody and liquidity framework required under a new reserve law. The two tranches create a bridge between today’s institutional rails and a future in which governments do not just buy Bitcoin but hold it. The initial exposure did not go directly on-chain. Instead, Texas entered via IBIT, which has become the default wrapper for large allocators seeking Bitcoin access within familiar regulatory and operational infrastructure. This purchase was enabled by Senate Bill 21, a law signed by Governor Greg Abbott in June that established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The framework allows the state Comptroller to accumulate Bitcoin so long as the asset maintains a 24-month average market capitalization above $500 billion. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that meets the threshold. The structure places the reserve outside the state treasury, sets governance channels for how the assets are held, and introduces an advisory committee to monitor risk and oversight. Meanwhile, the first $5 million is small relative to the scale of state finances, but the mechanics matter more than the number. Texas is testing whether Bitcoin can be formalized as a public reserve instrument within a state-level financial system that already manages hundreds of billions of dollars across different pools. Once the operational processes are in place, the second tranche will involve self-custodied Bitcoin, which introduces very different implications for liquidity, transparency, and audit practices. The state is designing procedures that resemble sovereign-grade custody rather than institutional brokerage. The reserve will require a qualified custodian, cold-storage capacity, key management protocols, independent audits, and reporting schedules. These are the building blocks of a repeatable template that other states could adopt without reinventing the governance architecture. The decision to enter through IBIT was not a signal of preference for ETFs over native Bitcoin. It was an operational workaround. IBIT is only in its second year, yet it has emerged as the most widely held Bitcoin ETF among major institutions. The fund is the largest Bitcoin ETF product, with cumulative net inflows of more than $62 billion. Moreover, the apparatus for public-sector self-custody does not exist in most jurisdictions, and creating that infrastructure requires procurement, security modeling, and political signoff. So, the state used IBIT as a placeholder, a temporary facility that allows it to express exposure while finalizing the permanent structure. This detour is instructive because it mirrors the trajectory of other large allocators. Harvard University disclosed that IBIT became one of its largest US equity holdings in the third quarter. Abu Dhabi Investment Council tripled its IBIT exposure over the same period, reaching roughly eight million shares. Wisconsin’s pension system disclosed more than $160 million across spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, also routed through IBIT. The pattern is clear. Large institutions with different mandates, geographies, and risk frameworks are gravitating toward the same instrument. IBIT offers custody through a known intermediary, simplified reporting lines, and a clean accounting presentation under the new fair-value rules that took effect in 2025. These conveniences have turned the ETF into a de facto entry point for public and quasi-public entities. Texas is unique only in the fact that its IBIT exposure is meant to be temporary. The broader question is whether Texas becomes an anomaly or a blueprint. Bitcoin analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera said: “The cascade is mathematical. Four to eight states are positioned to follow within eighteen months, collectively commanding over $1.2 trillion in reserves. Institutional inflows projected between $300 million to $1.5 billion in near-term mimicry. This is not speculation. This is game theory in motion.” Already, politically aligned states like New Hampshire and Arizona also have Bitcoin reserve laws because they view the top crypto as a strategic hedge to the global financial system. More states could follow, as they could use their structural surpluses to allocate to Bitcoin for diversification, especially under the new accounting standards that neutralize earlier mark-to-market penalties. Moreover, the implications of state-level involvement extend beyond symbolism. ETF purchases do not alter the circulating supply because the trust structure issues and redeems shares without removing coins from liquid markets. Self-custody does the opposite. Once coins are purchased for cold storage, they leave the tradable float, reducing the supply available to exchanges and market makers. This distinction matters if Texas scales the reserve beyond its initial $10 million. Even modest state-level demand introduces a new type of buy-side participant, one that behaves countercyclically to noise traders and does not churn positions. The effect resembles a stabilizing anchor rather than a source of volatility. If other states adopt similar policies, the Bitcoin supply curve becomes more inelastic, increasing price sensitivity.

Title: Crypto Investors Watch Closely as Kevin Hassett Becomes Frontrunner to Replace Jerome Powell

Time Published: 2025-11-26T18:00:36Z

Kevin Hassett has surged ahead in the race to become the next Federal Reserve Chair, as the crypto market watches closely. Hasset emerged as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate while the administration accelerates its search ahead of a planned Christmas announcement. With Jerome Powell’s term ending in May 2026, the stakes for markets, especially crypto, are enormous. Multiple reports from Bloomberg, Reuters, and other outlets confirm that Hassett, the current director of the White House National Economic Council, has become the clear frontrunner among five finalists vetted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Others still in contention include Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. But it is Hassett’s alignment with Trump’s preference for faster and deeper interest-rate cuts that has put him in pole position. In recent interviews, Hassett said he would cut rates “right now” based on current economic data, a sharp contrast to Powell’s more cautious approach. Prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket now show Hassett with roughly 55%–57% odds of being nominated, well ahead of his rivals. Hassett’s candidacy is drawing extraordinary attention from the digital asset world. Earlier this year, he disclosed holding more than $1 million in Coinbase stock, along with receiving over $50,000 for serving on Coinbase’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. He also chaired the White House’s digital asset working group, crafting key crypto-policy recommendations, including stablecoin regulation, taxation guidelines and elements of the administration’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal. These ties have sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest, given the Fed’s oversight of banking exposure to crypto and stablecoin frameworks. Yet many industry analysts view his ascent as a major bullish catalyst. Bitwise strategist Juan Leon said a Hassett-led Fed would be “strongly supportive of digital assets,” citing his dovish monetary stance and direct industry experience. Trump’s dissatisfaction with Powell, combined with internal divisions over inflation, labor data and the pace of easing, has only intensified speculation. The Fed has already delivered two cuts this fall, with markets widely expecting a third in December. If nominated and confirmed, Hassett would usher in one of the most crypto-friendly and pro-growth Federal Reserve leaderships in modern history. With the announcement expected before Christmas, both Wall Street and the crypto markets are watching closely for what could be a defining moment for monetary policy and digital asset regulation.

Title: Bitcoin Hyper Boosts as Texas Is First US State to Buy Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Texas just became the first US state to buy bitcoin, doing it not through a cold wallet but via BlackRock’s spot $BTC ETF. For institutions and treasuries, that’s a historic green light: clean regulatory rails, audited custody, and Bitcoin exposure that fits neatly into a traditional portfolio. For you as a retail investor, though, ETFs cap the upside. You get price tracking, not yield, leverage, or early-stage asymmetry. That’s why early-stage Bitcoin infrastructure plays are suddenly back in focus. Instead of just holding ‘paper BTC’ via an ETF, some are rotating into projects trying to fix Bitcoin’s biggest pain points: slow confirmation times, rising on-chain fees, and a scripting model that makes complex DeFi almost impossible. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is aiming to fill. As more headlines frame Texas’s move as the start of state-level Bitcoin adoption and another win for institutional adoption, a parallel conversation is happening in crypto-native circles. If institutions are content with ETF exposure, can agile investors position one layer closer to the innovation stack, into Bitcoin Layer 2s like Bitcoin Hyper, where the risk is higher but so is the potential upside? Texas opting for a BlackRock ETF underscores a simple reality: institutions want Bitcoin exposure without on-chain friction. However, the Bitcoin base layer still processes around 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees often spiking to several dollars when mempools become congested. That performance gap is exactly where Bitcoin Layer 2 projects are racing to compete. You’re already seeing multiple design paths emerge: pure payments, sidechains targeting EVM developers, and newer rollup-style architectures trying to anchor security on Bitcoin while offloading execution. In that mix, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)-powered option, aimed at high-frequency, Solana-style workloads, but has settled back on Bitcoin. Where many Bitcoin L2 designs bolt on EVM, Bitcoin Hyper takes a different route: integrating the Solana Virtual Machine so developers can deploy high-throughput Rust smart contracts on a Bitcoin-secured stack. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular approach: Bitcoin L1 acts as the settlement and security anchor, while a single trusted sequencer orders and executes transactions off-chain before periodically anchoring state to Bitcoin. That design enables sub-second finality, low-cost swaps, lending, gaming, and NFT trades in wrapped $BTC, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s base-layer trust assumptions. This is where investors start running the ETF-versus-early-stage math. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised $28.5M with tokens at $0.013335, suggesting some market conviction that a Bitcoin-native SVM chain could capture meaningful DeFi and dApp flows. If Bitcoin continues to institutionalize via ETFs, the next leverage point for growth may be infrastructure that turns idle BTC into productive capital. That’s the bet behind $HYPER: that users will want fast swaps, lending, staking, and gaming in BTC terms, not just passive price exposure. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper or join the $HYPER presale.

Title: Lefty NYC Comptroller Brad Lander tells top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over climate stance

Full Content:
New York City’s far-left outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander wants three of the city’s top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over allegations that the world’s largest money manager is not doing enough to fight climate change. The pol, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year, blasted the Larry Fink-led firm on Wednesday for allegedly buckling to pressure from the White House and Republicans and U-turning on green investments. “Climate risk is financial risk. You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires,” Lander, whose term ends Dec. 31, told Bloomberg. The left-winger — who recently admitted he’s mulling a congressional run — accused BlackRock of scaling back “climate engagement in ways that put our investments at risk needlessly.” Lander urged the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers’ Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System to shift their investments to rivals with a “more robust approach” to combating global warming. BlackRock Managing Director Armando Senra slammed the comptroller’s remarks as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers,” according to a letter posted on the firm’s website. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock. Lander also wants some of the funds to cut ties with Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, claiming that they, too, are not doing enough to help the environment. Neither has publicly commented. Lander cannot actually force the pension funds to take his suggestions — trustees of each one make the final decision. Socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his appointees will get some say over the Big Apple’s $300 billion pension system, Bloomberg noted. After losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, Lander became a strong backer of the capitalism-hating mayor-elect, who takes office Jan. 1.

Its assets under management worldwide hit a company record $13.46 trillion on Sept. 30, boosted by a rally in global markets and dealmaking income. The money manager, like many other Wall Street firms during the Biden administration, was a lightning rod for GOP lawmakers over its stance on DEI programs and Environmental Social Governance investing, known by its acronym ESG. The Securities and Exchange Commission, under President Trump-picked chair Paul Atkins, backed off on enforcing Biden-era ESG disclosure rules as part of a White House-led crackdown on ‘woke’ capitalism At the start of the year, just before Trump took office for a second time, BlackRock withdrew from a United Nations-backed Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative that aimed to pressure major corporations to reduce their carbon footprint. Then in June, the company was removed from Texas’ investment “blacklist” after it scaled back its climate commitments. Lander will be succeeded by current Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who also endorsed Mamdani. Levine’s role will be to act as an independent spending watchdog and ensure New Yorkers get the most bang for their buck while Mamdani pursues his aggressive socialist agenda, which includes rent freezes, free public buses, expanded free childcare and more. Levine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Landers’ BlackRock stance. Advertisement

Title: Who’s Kevin Hassett, Trump’s reported crypto-friendly pick for the Fed?

Time Published: 2025-11-26T15:37:30Z

Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, has reportedly emerged as a leader among the Trump administration’s short list to replace Jerome Powell. US President Donald Trump is slated to choose a new Federal Reserve chair by Christmas, and the frontrunner, Kevin Hassett, could be a boon for the crypto industry. Hassett is a White House economic adviser who has reportedly emerged as a strong candidate for the Fed chair position. He is the director of the National Economic Council and oversaw the digital asset working group directed by the White House earlier this year. Trump has been trying to increase his administration’s control over the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, thereby expanding the White House’s influence over monetary policy. The nomination process has not yet begun, but observers are already speculating about what a Hassett chairmanship could mean for US monetary policy and crypto. Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at the Columbia Business School in the 1990s. While there, he also served as an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was also a policy consultant with the Department of the Treasury under the administrations of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Hassett briefly sat on the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the first Trump administration. During the president’s second term, Hassett served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC), a part of the executive branch that the president uses for setting domestic and international economic policy. Despite a lack of clear public statements, Hassett is widely regarded as pro-crypto. In June, he revealed a stake of at least $1 million in Coinbase and that he was compensated at least $50,001 for his role on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. The NEC, where he serves as director, oversaw the development of the White House’s digital asset working group, which published a paper earlier this year outlining the administration’s policy on crypto. The Fed doesn’t oversee securities or commodities, so its policy changes can’t affect crypto regulation. But a crypto-friendly Fed could still have a positive impact on the industry in several ways. Related: Bitcoiners perk up as odds of a December Fed rate cut almost double Firstly, lower interest rates generally mean better crypto prices. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that the implications for markets are “strongly bullish.” He called Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts.” Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset investment platform Grayscale, said, “On the margin Hassett should be considered positive for crypto => supports rate cuts, past Coinbase advisor, NEC director during White House crypto policy push.” The Fed also regulates banks, namely bank holding companies, payment system access, reserve requirements and liquidity and risk rules. Tightening or loosening these rules could affect crypto companies’ access to a number of services, including: Crypto custody Lending against crypto collateral Access to payment rails Stablecoin issuer requirements vis-à-vis banking regulations Settlement rules. Still, the White House has yet to make a clear nomination. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced in late October that Hassett was on a short list of five nominees to replace Jerome Powell. These included former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. A nomination is expected by Christmas. Trump has been attempting to assert more control over the Federal Reserve as a means to exert greater influence over his preferred monetary policies. Earlier this year, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Her refusal to step down sent the case to the Supreme Court, which, for the time being, has allowed her to stay on. In a court filing, Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the attempt a “broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System.” The Council of Foreign Relations has lauded the independence of this system, stating that it “shields the Federal Reserve from undue political influence, such as pressure from the White House to lower interest rates ahead of an election, which could offer short-term political gains but cause long-term economic harm.” An independent Fed also “enhances the Fed’s credibility” and makes the market more confident in its decisions. “Crucially, it also empowers the Federal Reserve to take difficult but necessary actions, even when they are unpopular.” John Authers, a senior editor for markets and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote that choosing Hassett “appears to be about loyalty.” George Pollack, a senior US policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, reportedly said that Trump will nominate Hassett “because of his confidence that Hassett will be the candidate most likely to support the administration’s priorities.” Were the Fed to become another arm of the administration, the results could be good for crypto markets in the short term but disastrous elsewhere. Lower-than-needed interest rates could score cheap political points but lead to increased inflation. The Center for American Progress explained, “Knowing that the rates will be based on well-researched data, and not political whims, assures the world that the U.S. economy will remain relatively stable and its markets will remain rational.” Magazine: Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Next week could decide whether SEC lets your Apple shares live on-chain — with the same protections

Time Published: 2025-11-26T14:09:40Z

The Investor Advisory Committee will probe how issuance, trading, and settlement could work under existing rules. Here’s the practical path and the roadblocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Dec. 4 meeting of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee opens with a question the agency has spent years avoiding: “What does it actually look like when publicly traded equities live on a blockchain?” Not as wrapped derivatives on offshore exchanges, not as speculative tokens detached from shareholder rights, but as registered securities trading inside the same regulatory framework that governs Apple shares today. The two-hour panel, titled “Tokenization of Equities: How Issuance, Trading, and Settlement Would Work with Existing Regulation,” assembles market-structure architects from Nasdaq, BlackRock, Coinbase, Citadel Securities, Robinhood, and Galaxy Digital to sketch that path in public for the first time. The timing reflects pressure the SEC can no longer deflect. Nasdaq recently filed a formal proposal to trade tokenized versions of listed stocks alongside traditional shares on the same order book, arguing that blockchain settlement requires no carve-outs from the national market system. Commissioner Hester Peirce made clear in July that tokenization “does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset.” Additionally, tokenized securities remain securities and are subject to the full federal regime. What Dec. 4 tests is whether that framing can survive contact with implementation details: Who holds the keys? How does the NBBO work when trades settle in seconds instead of two days? Can you short a token the same way you short a share? Nasdaq’s blueprint offers the clearest view of what “inside the system” tokenization looks like. The exchange proposes allowing listed equities to trade in either traditional digital form or as tokens, with both versions sharing the same CUSIP, execution priority, and economic rights. The token lives at the settlement layer. Issuers still register under the Securities Act, exchanges still operate under the Exchange Act, broker-dealers still route orders through consolidated feeds, and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) still guarantees delivery. Blockchain replaces the back-end ledger, not the front-end rulebook. That structure keeps tokenized equities inside Regulation NMS, which means trades still contribute to the national best bid and offer, market makers still face quote obligations, and surveillance still flags wash trades and spoofing. Nasdaq warns that parallel venues outside NMS would fragment liquidity, undermine price discovery, and leave issuers blind to where their stock actually trades. The filing explicitly rejects exemptions: tokenization is a settlement technology, not a new asset class that warrants lighter-touch oversight. On settlement, Nasdaq points to DTC building blockchain infrastructure so token trades can clear on-chain while the exchange’s matching engine and data feeds remain unchanged. If that plumbing arrives on schedule, live trading could start as early as the third quarter of next year. The model assumes that transfer agents maintain tokenized registers the same way they maintain book-entry registers today, with the same custody standards and financial responsibility rules, just with a different database underlying them. The Dec. 4 agenda flags a distinction the crypto press often collapses: natively issued tokenized shares versus wrapper structures. Native tokens mean the issuer itself places equity on-chain or directs its transfer agent to maintain a blockchain register, conveying full voting rights, dividend claims, and liquidation preferences. Wrapper tokens, common on offshore platforms, offer only economic exposure: price goes up, investors profit, but they can’t vote the shares or sue in a derivative action. Nasdaq’s filing uses European venues as a cautionary tale. Tokens tracking Apple and Amazon traded there at prices wildly divergent from the underlying stock, required no issuer consent, and granted holders neither voting rights nor liquidation rights. When those tokens crashed, buyers discovered they owned synthetic derivatives, not shares. The exchange argues that letting such products proliferate without registration would gut investor protections and create a shadow equity market that regulators can’t see. The panel will probe how ownership rights flow through tokenized structures, not because the SEC is confused about what a share is, but because wrapping introduces intermediaries who may or may not pass through governance and economic rights. If a token only tracks price, it can start to resemble a security-based swap, triggering different disclosure and margining rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) commentary explicitly stated that investors must retain the same legal and beneficial ownership in tokenized form, or the product morphs into something entirely different. The Dec. 4 agenda spans a spectrum of regulatory friction. At the low-friction end are issuers registering tokenized shares, listing them on national securities exchanges, and trading them interchangeably with traditional digital shares, as Nasdaq proposes. Existing statutes already permit that if tokenization is treated as a settlement method rather than a product innovation. Blockchain as record-keeping technology also fits, provided registered clearing agencies and transfer agents meet current custody and books-and-records standards. Earlier SEC staff statements on digital asset custody frame this as compliance engineering, not boundary-pushing. At the high-friction end, there is actual 24/7 trading of listed equities, which collides with Reg NMS assumptions about market hours and consolidated data. Regulators float 24/7 markets in the crypto context, but applying that to tokenized Apple shares means rewriting how best execution works when New York sleeps and Tokyo trades. Models where tokenized equities trade only on non-NMS blockchain venues, unregistered as exchanges or alternative trading systems, also clash with existing rules. Nasdaq and SIFMA both argue that allowing equity volume to migrate to unconnected platforms would shred the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and leave retail investors with stale quotes. Senate work on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act points in the opposite direction, explicitly classifying tokenized stocks and bonds as securities and cementing SEC oversight. That suggests any attempt to treat tokenized shares as outside the agency’s remit will hit legislative headwinds, not tailwinds. The Investor Advisory Committee can submit findings and recommendations, but it does not write rules. The panel is a stress test to see if Coinbase, Citadel Securities, and Nasdaq can agree on what compliant tokenization looks like when they’re forced to reconcile custody models, interoperability standards, and short-selling mechanics in the same room. If they can, the SEC gains a reference architecture for evaluating filings like Nasdaq’s. If they can’t, the agency learns where the technical or incentive mismatches sit before approving anything. What the panel won’t do is approve Nasdaq’s proposal, rewrite the definition of a security, or bless offshore stock tokens that skip issuer consent. It also won’t resolve whether 24/7 trading or cross-chain interoperability requires new exemptive relief, as those questions depend on engineering details the advisory body isn’t equipped to answer. At most, Dec. 4 yields a menu of options the Commission can reference when deciding whether tokenized equities belong in the national market system or require a parallel structure that current law doesn’t yet contemplate. The meeting matters because it forces the question into the open. The answer still depends on whether the market wants to retrofit blockchain into existing rails or build new ones, and the SEC has to authorize it from scratch.

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. New York City outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander recommended the city’s pension plans drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora as asset managers. Lander, whose term as comptroller ends at the end of the calendar year, said all 49 of the asset managers for the city’s pension plans submitted their decarbonization plans to measure their alignment with the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan. However, following an evaluation of those plans, BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora’s plans did not meet climate expectations, Lander said. BlackRock is the pension system’s largest asset manager and currently manages $42.3 billion for all three pension plans, according to Lander’s letter to trustees. Fidelity manages $384 million for the TRS plan, and PanAgora manages $358 million for the TRS and NYCERS plans, according to the letter to the plans’ trustees. Lander said in the Nov. 26 release that the three asset managers “fail to address climate risk with the seriousness [the pension plans] expect.” “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said. “Our Net Zero plan is a core part of our fiduciary duty to protect these assets. I am pleased to report that 46 of our 49 public markets managers are aligned with our expectations for decarbonization; unfortunately, three are not.” The NYC comptroller said he has “significant concerns regarding BlackRock’s restrictive approach” to engaging with public companies it owns more than 5% of the equities. The asset manager said it will not proactively reach out to on proxy voting issues to align with a “conservative interpretation” of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s updated engagement guidelines. BlackRock also recently began allowing clients it doesn’t vote proxies for to opt into its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship strategy, which Lander recommended the trustees’ formally vote to approve for the system’s non-U.S. equity index funds that BlackRock manages. For the public equity index funds BlackRock manages for the system, Lander recommended issuing a search notice to find “appropriate managers for BlackRock’s U.S. public equity index mandates to address the Systems’ climate expectations consistent with fiduciary duties.” “While BlackRock has a global [Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship] focus list of 900 companies, it says it will not proactively reach out to U.S. companies nor set agendas for engagement; consequently, it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans,” Lander told the system’s trustees. “BlackRock also says it cannot seek to influence these companies’ actions, which means it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans with respect to their U.S. portfolios.” In a follow-up statement issued Wednesday, BlackRock said it had responded to a direct request from the New York City Bureau of Asset Management — which oversees the investments for the city's five public pension funds — and met with its investment team earlier in the month to provide an update on its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship program. The asset manager said it informed NYC BAM that a version of the program was now available to all five pension plans. “Today, you recommended that three pension plans take certain actions after your departure, including terminating BlackRock’s index equity mandate. In doing so, you accused BlackRock of abdicating its financial duty and putting New York City’s pensions at risk,” BlackRock said in the Nov. 26 statement addressing Lander. “These statements are another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander also suggested terminating the mandates for Fidelity and PanAgora, which both actively manage U.S. small cap equity mandates for the system. In their place, Lander said the system should seek recommendations for how to re-allocate those assets, according to the letter to trustees. Lander recommended moving on from Fidelity, as the asset manager has “taken a restrictive approach to engaging companies outside of the U.S.,” and is voluntarily applying the SEC’s engagement guidance to both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The comptroller said other asset managers of non-U.S. strategies have not taken the same approach, which “precludes Fidelity from meeting the Systems’ expectations and prudently addressing climate risk and opportunity in their engagement of companies.” Lander said PanAgora does not engage companies beyond the topic of emissions disclosures. As such, “they do not engage companies to take any decarbonization actions to improve carbon efficiency such as setting emissions reduction targets or adopting decarbonization plans even when such actions may be beneficial to a company.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Left-leaning California and New York and conservative-led Florida and Texas have stepped up regulatory measures to underscore ESG’s role — or lack thereof — in their jurisdictions.
