Speculation over a purported White House plan to pause tariffs for ninety days on all countries except China sent markets into a frenzy earlier today, triggering abrupt price reversals across equities, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In a quick-fire series of conflicting updates, the rumor initially floated at around 10:10 AM ET, sparked momentum in risk assets, and was eventually deemed “fake news” by the White House. The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) described the chronology on X, noting: “What just happened? At 10:10 AM ET, rumors emerged that the White House was considering a ‘90-day tariff pause.’ At 10:15 AM ET, CNBC reported that Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for ALL countries except for China. By 10:18 AM ET, the S&P 500 had added over +$3 TRILLION in market cap from its low.” However, only seven minutes later, at 10:25 AM ET, reports emerged that the White House was ‘unaware’ of Trump considering a 90-day pause. “At 10:26 AM ET, CNBC reports that the 90-day tariff pause headlines were incorrect. At 10:34 AM ET, the White House officially called the tariff pause headlines ‘fake news.’ By 10:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 erased -$2.5 TRILLION of market cap from its high, 22 minutes prior. Never in history have we seen something like this,” The Kobeissi Letter writes. The mere suggestion of a temporary reprieve from tariffs managed to shift sentiment rapidly in both equity and crypto markets. BTC, which was trading around $75,805 at the time, soared by roughly 7.2% to surpass $81,200 within half an hour. Once confirmation arrived that no such pause was planned, the gains evaporated almost as fast as they had arrived, pulling Bitcoin back to roughly $77,560. The abrupt turn of events unleashed a wave of commentary among crypto observers. Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) remarked that “The fake news tweet showed there’s a lot of sidelined capital at least for relief rally and the risk is to the upside on any positive news at least temporarily.” Will Clemente III cautioned: “Bear take: Liquidity is bad and this volatility might break something. Bull take: This headline was the cointelegraph intern BTC ETF headline but for equities.” Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, remarked that “Bitcoin’s current price drawdown is about to become the largest of the current cycle,” illustrating his point with a chart that showed BTC’s correction reaching -26.62%, matching the scale of August 2024’s correction. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) invoked BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s observation that another 20% market drop is not out of the question, saying: “That’s the thing. Under normal circumstances, probability of such scenarios or things such as stagflation are so low you can just brush them off. Trump opened up the left tail => anything is possible. We are one headline away from a 7% candle in either direction.” Podcast host Felix Jauvin (@fejau_inc) agrees: “What’s so crazy about this crash vs other is its entirely self-willed and could be reversed in an instant on one tweet. Has there ever been anything like that?” In the midst of the turmoil, European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed a willingness to seek solutions, stating, “Europe is ready to negotiate with the US,” including the possibility of zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods.

Title: Audit finds Hong Kong firm flouted terms of Panama Canal ports contract
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2998279/audit-finds-hong-kong-firm-flouted-terms-of-panama-canal-ports-contract
Time Published: 2025-04-08T04:45:00Z
Full Content:
PANAMA CITY - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two ports at either end of the Panama Canal -- which sparked US President Donald Trump's threats to seize the waterway -- has flouted the terms of its contract, according to Panamanian audit results released Monday. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told reporters, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was set to arrive in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. But Flores denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal, by force if necessary. Faced with Trump's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned. Panama Ports, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, won the concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side in 1997. The concession was renewed for another 25 years in 2021.

Title: Government to close under-fire $400m climate fund
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/government-to-close-under-fire-400m-climate-fund/PP547BI2RBFRTJERJNLQMS5AJ4/

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said the fund would be wound down. Photo / RNZ The Government plans to close a $400 million climate investment fund, begun by former Climate Change Minister James Shaw. The fund had been under fire for backing SolarZero, shortly before the solar energy company was liquidated. Current Climate Change Minister Simon Watts announced today that New Zealand Green Investment Finance (NZGIF) will stop making new investments and will wind down its existing portfolio. The Government is not sure how much money it will recoup from the sell down. Watts’ office said it was “too early to comment on the amount of money the Crown will recoup from NZGIF”. However, the fund’s “new mandate is focused on expediting the repurposing of the portfolio in a timely manner that maximises returns”. Watts said the fund had invested “almost $400 million” with “very limited results”. It is meant to act as a green bank, making targeted investments in firms to help them decarbonise. “[T]here are more than 20 government funds operating with similar objectives,” he said. Watts said NZGIF would develop a plan for ministers outlining how changes will be implemented within 90 says. The move to sell the portfolio comes as global share markets are suffering their biggest sell off since the Covid-19 pandemic, making it a particularly challenging time to sell many assets. The fund had recently made investments in Far North Solar Farms, Ruminant BioTech, and Sundergise. The fund copped criticism last year after it was caught up in the collapse of SolarZero, which was liquidated by its owner, American investment firm BlackRock. Advances of $115m from the fund were made to install solar panels and batteries in households under lease-type arrangements. These were not caught up in the liquidation, as the loans, securities and monthly payments from households are tied to trusts and companies controlled by Public Trust. NZGIF chair Cecilia Tarrant resigned in the wake of the scandal. The fund’s most recent annual report estimated the lifetime emissions reduction its combined investments at June 30, 2024 to be 1.3 million to 1.6 million tonnes of CO2-e. “This is greater than New Zealand’s entire annual domestic airline emissions in 2022 and will continue to grow as we make further investments,” Tarrant said at the time. “This Government is serious about climate change, that’s why we have committed to doubling renewable energy, investing in technology to lower emissions while boosting productivity, and cutting barriers to green investment,” Watts said. “We will prioritise actions that have the greatest impact on emissions and growth and will provide real value for money. “In the current economic environment New Zealanders want assurance that taxpayer money is being well spent and delivering results. We believe NZGIF is no longer aligned to that vision,” he said. Thomas Coughlan is deputy political editor and covers politics from Parliament.

Title: More people own crypto in Singapore, with younger users leading the way: Survey
URL: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/more-people-own-crypto-in-singapore-with-younger-users-leading-the-way-survey
Time Published: 2025-04-08T04:34:46Z
Full Content:
SINGAPORE – More people in Singapore own cryptocurrencies, and younger users are leading the way in using the asset for daily financial needs, such as online shopping and bill payments, a new study shows. The number of Singapore residents who own cryptocurrencies is on the rise, with 26 per cent owning digital assets in 2024, up from 24.4 per cent in 2023. A majority of them, or 52 per cent, have paid for goods and services with it, and 67 per cent plan to increase their usage of crypto for payments in future. Gen Zs and millennials, or those aged between 16 and 44 years old as at 2025, lead in crypto ownership, with about 40 per cent of them holding the asset. Of this group of people, 41.1 per cent use crypto for online shopping, 35.9 per cent for bill payments and 27 per cent for in-store retail goods. While younger people use crypto to pay for retail goods and bills, those older – aged 45 and above in 2025 – use crypto more for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as those made between friends and family. Among the older generation, 42.9 per cent use crypto for P2P transactions, with 35.7 per cent using it for online shopping and 17.2 per cent for bill payments. These were some of the findings from the study by Singapore-based crypto payment firm Triple-A, based on a survey of 1,006 residents here. Singapore has seen a notable increase in crypto payments, with merchant services receiving nearly US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in crypto in the second quarter of 2024, much higher than any other quarter in the past two years, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. A separate Chainalysis report in September 2024 noted a growing adoption of crypto as a payment method in Singapore. “The combination of regulatory clarity and merchant adoption suggests that Singapore is positioning itself as a major hub for digital assets, which could eventually attract more global businesses and investors,” Chainalysis said. AXS, in partnership with Triple-A, allows its app users to make top-ups or pay bills in digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin and Tether. Other merchants which have partnered Triple-A to offer the crypto payment option include fashion brand Charles & Keith on its e-commerce platform and Apple products reseller iStudio at its retail stores. The findings from Triple-A noted that 37 per cent of respondents cited global acceptance as a key benefit of crypto payments. Higher transaction speed (29 per cent) and lower fees (20 per cent) were also important factors, particularly for cross-border and time-sensitive transactions. But there were concerns about the crypto ecosystem. The complexity involved in using crypto was the top challenge cited by 63 per cent of respondents. For instance, users need to figure out the use of private keys or passwords, which enable them to access and manage their crypto funds. Security concerns (60 per cent) and lack of merchant acceptance (54 per cent) were also factors of concern. The crypto payment trend comes against a backdrop of a rising number of digital payment token (DPT) firms being licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), fuelling new roles in the growing Web3 industry. Web3 companies are those that use blockchain technology to build products and services. As at end-November, MAS has issued a record 13 new DPT licences in 2024, raising the total number of DPT licensees from 16 to 29, said a report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs released in December 2024. Despite a global slowdown in hiring, with mass layoffs in 2024, more than 75 per cent of local Web3 companies want to expand their workforce in 2025 as they continue developing products and services for global and regional markets. This is according to the Singapore: The OnChain State report led by the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), Web3 business account platform HQ.xyz as well as Web3 builder communities SG Builders and Superteam, which conducted surveys and case studies with 53 Web3 companies. The report said 60 per cent of these companies are looking to expand their current workforce by half or more. SFA, which facilitates collaboration between market participants and stakeholders in the fintech ecosystem, told The Straits Times that the hiring plans are driven by growing institutional adoption, ongoing technology improvements in blockchain and the expansion of applications for Web3 technology. Moves that increased institutional adoption of digital assets include the US Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched by BlackRock, Fidelity and others in January 2024. A total of 2,433 people are currently employed in the local Web3 sector, excluding those working in Web3 roles in non-Web3-native companies. These roles include those in partnerships, marketing strategy and sales to help Web3 companies go to market with their solutions, said SFA. Product managers as well as developers and software engineers are also key roles being hired. “We also see jobs being created in the professional services sector that support Web3, which include legal, advisory and consulting roles,” SFA said. Companies outlined what they hope to see improvements on as the acceptance of Web3 grows in Singapore. Limited or complete lack of access to services such as banking, with 59 per cent of Web3 companies indicating so, poses significant barriers for these businesses, particularly those in the early stages of development as they rely on these services to ensure operational stability and regulatory compliance. “The perceived risk associated with crypto and Web3 activities leads many service providers to shy away from engaging with these companies, further exacerbating the problem,” the report said. As a result, there is a growing demand for more streamlined, Web3-specific regulatory frameworks that would enable easier access to both banking and non-banking services critical to business growth, the report said. Web3 companies also wished for a forum where they can directly engage policymakers to foster better understanding and ensure that regulatory frameworks can keep pace with rapid advancements, they said.

Title: Top White House trade advisor ‘guarantees no recession’ under Trump’s tariff plan despite market freefall

Top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday “guaranteed” that the US will not plunge into a recession under President Trump and claimed there would be no inflation despite ongoing fallout from his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Navarro’s promise comes amid concern from Wall Street that the US economy may already be contracting in the aftermath of Trump’s sweeping announcement of new tariffs last week. “It’s finding a bottom now,” Navarro said of the stock market freefall during an interview with Fox News “Ingraham Angle” host Laura Ingraham Monday night. “But look, here’s the thing, it’s going to shift over, and it’s going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here,” he added. “Those are the ones going to lead to recovery, and it’s going to happen.” Navarro then made a pair of bold economic predictions. “Dow: 50,000, I guarantee that, and I guarantee no recession,” the White House official declared. Navarro’s confidence comes from his belief that Congress will soon enact the president’s economic agenda, including eliminating taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay and extending tax cuts authorized during Trump’s first term. US stocks jump as trading partners rush to negotiate with Trump on tariffs “Why? Because when we pass the biggest, broadest tax cut in history, within a matter of months, that’s going to be a great stimulus,” the Trump adviser said. “There’s not going to be any inflation,” Navarro continued. “We’ve already had a significant drop, a huge drop in oil prices – that’s like a point off the [inflation index]. We’re going to have lower yields and mortgage [rates].” In contrast, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday that most business leaders already feel the nation is in an economic downturn. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink said. A recession is a period of significant decline in economic activity that lasts for more than a few months. It’s typically recognized by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan has roiled the stock market, but it’s too early to tell what lasting effect it will have on economic growth. In the first two days following Trump’s announcement last week, the S&P 500 index plummeted 10.5% – its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 300 points on Monday and is more than 10% below its December record close. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was up less than a percentage point on Monday but confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close, according to Reuters. Navarro confirmed that foreign leaders are calling the White House and desperately trying to work out a deal to cut the new tariffs, but he argued they’re focusing on the wrong thing. The leaders are “saying ‘We want to talk. We’ll lower our tariffs to zero if you’ll lower yours’… That’s not the problem,” Navarro said. The trade adviser cited the example of Vietnam, which was hit with a 46% levy, and sells “$15 for every $1 we sell them.” “Zero tariffs would get us no reduction in the $123 billion deficit we have,” Navarro argued, adding that “$5 of that $15 they sell us … It’s China.” “They don’t buy anything ours and they want to go to 0-0.” Advertisement

Title: Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama audit

East Asia View of the Port of Balboa, managed by CK Hutchison Holdings, based in Hong Kong, located at the entrance to the Panama Canal in Panama City, on Mar 12, 2025. (File photo: AFP/Martin Bernetti) PANAM CITY: The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released on Monday (Apr 7), as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive US$1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told reporters, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The US has said it is a threat to its national security - and the region as a whole - for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which 5 per cent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honour the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honouring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries - including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal - to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on Apr 2 as planned. The Panama Ports concession to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was renewed for another 25 years in 2021.

Title: CK Hutchison’s Panama Port Concession Under Fire as $22.8B Deal Hangs in the Balance

Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows a cruise ship and a cargo ship transiting through the Gatun locks at the Panama Canal, in Colon, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY, April 7 (Reuters) – Panama’s Comptroller General office will file a lawsuit against the officials who authorized the renewal of a 25-year port concession to a company led by CK Hutchison, the comptroller general said on Monday, as a key audit of the contract is expected to be completed soon. The contract to Panama Ports Company for the Balboa and Cristobal ports near the Panama Canal, in which Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison has a 90% stake, was renewed in 2021. The Panamanian government started the audit in January and in March a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock announced a $22.8 billion deal to buy most of CK Hutchison’s global ports business including the two ports in Panama. The audit has so far determined that Panama “left $1.3 billion on the table,” Comptroller General Anel Flores told reporters in a press conference, referring to tax incentives and benefits granted by the government in the contract. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will have the last word on that. Once finished, the audit results will be submitted to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports, Flores said. The audit is seen as a possible roadblock in BlackRock’s offer for CK Hutchison’s port business, which has been criticized by China. If Panama’s Comptroller General confirms irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to take control of the Panama Canal due to the presence of Chinese and Hong Kong firms in the Central American country’s maritime business, celebrated BlackRock’s announced deal for CK Hutchison’s ports. The transaction has not been completed.

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks close mixed in choppy trade

Tuesday, 08 Apr 2025 NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Monday in the roller-coaster trading session as investors' anxiety over a potential economic slowdown and persistent inflation remained elevated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 349.26 points, or 0.91 percent, to 37,965.6. The S&P 500 sank 11.83 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,062.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 15.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to 15,603.26. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with real estate and materials leading the laggards by losing 2.40 percent and 1.65 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, communication services and technology went up 1.03 percent and 0.32 percent, respectively. Earlier in the day, all three major U.S. stock indexes hit their lowest levels in more than a year, reflecting deepening concern across Wall Street. The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX and widely regarded as Wall Street's fear gauge, surged past 60 points for the first time since August 2024, before settling back to 46.35 by the afternoon session. Markets briefly rallied mid-morning after a news report suggested that Trump might be considering a 90-day pause on tariff implementations. However, the gains quickly evaporated after White House officials denied the report, pushing equities back into negative territory before a late-session rebound. "Margin calls are going out as we speak," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. "For a third straight day investors in U.S. equity markets have turned (a) huge thumbs down on the White House Liberation Day tariffs which have rocked Wall Street." U.S. President Trump made a new threat to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods as he requested China to withdraw retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Adding to the day's developments, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent posted on social media that Trump had directed him to initiate negotiations with Japan's government following what Bessent described as a "very constructive" phone conversation between the two leaders. Bessent also said: "I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies. I appreciate the Japanese government's outreach and measured approach to this process." "The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe...this is not what we voted for," wrote Bill Ackman, billionaire head of Pershing Square, on X. "The president has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down." If Trump's tariffs push the U.S. economy into a recession, chip stocks could have at least another 20 percent to fall, according to Citi. "We believe the biggest risk to the semi sector is a recession resulting from tariffs," Chris Danely, a managing director at the bank, wrote to clients in a recent note. If the tariffs continue for another month, it is highly likely the supply chain will "freeze up" given uncertainty, drastically lower order rates/inventory, and result in lower guidance across the board - similar to Covid, said Danely. Notably, CEOs were already growing more pessimistic about the U.S. economy. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Monday. "One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine - canary in the coal mine - and I was told that the canary is sick already," he added. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also warned Monday that Trump's tariffs are likely to push up prices on both domestic and imported goods, placing additional pressure on an already cooling U.S. economy.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? How many products do you have in your home right now that were made in China? If you are like most Americans, that number is very high. We should have never allowed ourselves to become so dependent on cheap Chinese goods, but we did. Walmart, Target and our dollar stores are absolutely teeming with products that were manufactured in China, and now those products are about to get much more expensive. The 34 percent “retaliatory tariff” that the Trump administration recently imposed on the Chinese was on top of a 20 percent tariff that the Trump administration had already imposed on them. The White House has confirmed this. Unfortunately, the 54 percent tariff that we were potentially facing will now rise to 104 percent thanks to an additional 50 percent tariff that will go into effect on April 9th. Earlier today, President Trump posted the following on his Truth Social account… Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set. Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! The math is very clear: 20 percent plus 34 percent plus 50 percent equals 104 percent. No matter how the pundits try to spin this, the truth is that we will be paying this tariff if we continue to purchase Chinese products. It is easy to say that we should just switch to products made in the U.S., but in thousands of cases there simply are not any similar products manufactured here. And in thousands of other cases, products that are ultimately assembled in the U.S. depend on components that come from China. Once again, we should have never allowed ourselves to get into this situation. Trying to reverse course now is going to be a major league headache. I asked Google AI to tell me some of the products that we get from China, and it produced quite an extensive list… Consumer Electronics: China is a major source for smartphones, computers, video game consoles, and other electronic devices. Toys and Games: A significant portion of the toys, games, and sporting goods imported into the U.S. come from China. Furniture and Bedding: China is a major source for furniture, bedding, and other home goods. Textiles and Clothing: China is a major source for textile products and clothing. Machinery and Electrical Equipment: China is a major source for machinery, nuclear reactors, boilers, and electrical equipment Other Products: China also supplies the U.S. with items like lithium-ion batteries, plastics, and miscellaneous manufactured goods. Food: While a small percentage of the U.S. food supply comes from China, it is a major supplier for specific items like apple juice, garlic, canned mandarin oranges, fish, and shrimp. At this point, a list of things that we don’t get from China might be shorter. I am particularly concerned about what these tariffs will do to the pharmaceutical industry, because Google AI says that the vast majority of the active ingredients in our pharmaceutical drugs are imported from China… While it’s difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage, a significant portion of raw materials for pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S. come from China, with estimates suggesting that around 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are sourced from China and other countries like India. We are in so much trouble. Bill Ackman is warning that unless these tariffs are rolled back we are headed into a “self-induced economic nuclear winter”… Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch President Trump ally, has warned that the world is on the brink of “self-induced economic nuclear winter” as he begged the commander-in-chief to pause his sweeping tariffs. “The President has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down,” Ackman wrote in a lengthy X post Sunday night. “May cooler heads prevail.” Bill Ackman wouldn’t have become a billionaire if he wasn’t extremely sharp, and I agree with his assessment. The outlook for the months ahead is extremely dismal. In fact, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is admitting that most CEOs that he talks to “would say we are probably in a recession right now”… BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the stock market could see declines deepen by another 20% amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Tariffs are expected to make a wide variety of products more expensive, exacerbating inflationary pressures that have been persistent in recent months. As I discussed on Friday, our economic momentum has been taking us in the wrong direction for a long time. And now these tariffs are going to introduce a tremendous amount of chaos into the equation. As a result of the tariffs that were just imposed, Volkswagen is actually “holding 37,000 cars at US ports”… Volkswagen is holding 37,000 cars at US ports amid tariff turmoil. Audi, the luxury arm of the world’s second largest global automaker, has confirmed it’s in a high-stakes holding pattern triggered by President Donald Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles. The affected cars arrived in the U.S. the same day Trump announced the sweeping levies. Now, they sit idle as VW considers its next move. Executives are thought to be hoping for either a presidential U-turn or a chance to negotiate a lower rate. How long can they possibly hold these vehicles at our ports? Of course the U.S. auto industry is going to be hit really hard as well… If President Trump’s trade war has a physical battleground, it is Michigan, where companies and workers are already feeling the beginning of an onslaught that could blow a hole in the state’s economy. Nearly 20% of the economy is tied to the auto industry, which has become increasingly dependent on parts and vehicles from Canada, Mexico and China—imports Trump hit with steep tariffs in recent weeks. This trade has grown so large that Michigan ranks fifth in the nation by the size of its imports and exports, even though its total economy ranks 14th. Even before the tariffs were announced, it was clear that a major slowdown was now upon us. For example, the number of commercial bankruptcies in March 2025 was much higher than the number of commercial bankruptcies in March 2024… More companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March than a year ago, indicating economic stress among U.S. businesses, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI). “Commercial Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings increased 20 percent in March 2025, with filings climbing to 733 from the 611 filings registered in March 2024,” ABI said in an April 3 statement. And during the first three months of this year, U.S. banks filed to close hundreds of local branches… Banks filed nearly 400 notices for the planned closures of some of their locations across the U.S. in the first three months of the year, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) records. Only some of these branches have already shut their doors. The closure of others has received approval from the OCC but has not yet been carried through by the bank, which may ultimately decide against it. Many are pending approval from the OCC, an independent federal agency which safeguards the U.S. banking system, making sure it remains accessible to underserved consumers and communities. I have been warning that it was not going to take much to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Unfortunately, we just got a really big shove. We have been through so much economic pain over the past four years, and I know that a lot of people out there were quite eager for better times to arrive. Sadly, what we are about to experience is not going to be pleasant at all.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all U.S. imports on April 5, sparking retaliatory measures from Beijing and the European Union and igniting fears of a global trade war. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Fink shared that many of his fellow executives believe the market meltdown is a sign the U.S. is in the midst of an economic recession, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink said. The executive’s comments come as investors panic over a market meltdown triggered by President Trump’s economic policy, which relies heavily on tariffs that many analysts believe will trigger a global recession. On Monday, Trump reiterated his commitment to these punitive measures, telling his X followers to be “strong…and patient.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite— two widely watched indices that measure the health of the U.S. stock market—have cratered 10% over the past five days. Similarly, the cryptocurrency market, worth $2.59 trillion as of publication time, has lost 7% of its market value in the past week, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptos by market value, have plunged 4% and 13% over the same period, respectively. Meanwhile, major altcoins such as Solana and XRP are trading down 14% and 7%, respectively, over the past seven days. As stocks have slid, several major financial institutions ratcheted back their economic forecasts. Goldman Sachs upped its recession odds forecast by 10 percentage points to 45%, while JPMorgan put those odds at 60%, according to Reuters. Despite those bearish numbers, Fink told investors the market turbulence presented "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” adding that the carnage did not pose systemic risks. Still, "that doesn't mean we can't fall another 20% from here too," Fink said.

Title: Farewell, Fugazy!
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4309527/posts

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/07/2025 1:55:36 PM PDT by little jeremiah "Ah, the delicious smell of peak fear on Sunday/Monday...and max NOISE on X." —Raoul Pal That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out.

Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days.

It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program.

What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out.

Title: Pundit Reveals Predicted Timeline For Ripple’s XRP To Skyrocket to $27 Price
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pundit-reveals-predicted-timeline-for-ripples-xrp-to-skyrocket-to-27-price/
Time Published: 2025-04-07T20:25:06Z
Full Content:
Despite a relatively calm market and XRP trading within a descending triangle that has persisted for weeks amid bearish pressure, the token may be gearing up for a major breakout, according to popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto. In a detailed analysis, Egrag predicted that XRP could surge to as high as $27 within the next six months if current technical patterns continue to play out, further suggesting a repeat of its 2017 bull run. “The Kangaroo will jump,” the pundit tweeted Sunday, referencing what he calls the current “Kangaroo Phase” or a period of consolidation before an expected breakout. Notably, the analyst highlighted striking similarities between the March 2025 candle formation and October 2017’s patterns, suggesting history may be preparing to repeat itself. “The monthly candle in November 2017 ranged before the explosive growth in December 2017 and January 2018. If this pattern holds true, and I’m right about the candle formations rhyming, double digits are on the horizon,” Egrag stated. Central to the prediction is XRP maintaining support above the $2 support area, which he described as “the safest foundation” and the trigger for the “FOMO stage and ignition phase.” The analyst further outlined three Fibonacci targets, including $7.50, $13.70, and ultimately $27.30, each aligning with Fibonacci expansion levels. “The next 3-6 months are crucial and decisive for many of us” Egrag concluded, emphasizing the critical timeframe for this potential price movement. This isn’t the first time EGRAG has voiced a bullish outlook on XRP. Last month, he referred to the price range between $2.00 and $3.40 as “noise,” indicating that the current consolidation phase reflects healthy price action rather than weakness. According to the analyst, as long as XRP stays within this range, the conditions remain favorable for a potential breakout, with targets reaching from $27 to as high as $222. However, analysts are facing a bit of uncertainty, as several factors, such as the U.S. announcing crypto holdings, the SEC’s comments on the Ripple case, the growing interest in RLUSD, rumors of a BlackRock ETF, and increasing XRP utility globally, haven’t been enough to sustain XRP’s bullish momentum. As a result, attention has shifted to the $2 support level, which is now being closely monitored. On Saturday,analyst AMcrypto underscored the importance of this level stating, “XRP is holding its $2 support level pretty well. It’s one of the few altcoins that didn’t drop below February’s capitulation price. For upside, it needs to break above the $2.30 level; otherwise, the consolidation will continue.” On-chain data from Santiment further supports the bullish sentiment, showing that over 70% of Binance traders holding open XRP futures positions are betting on a price increase. XRP traded at $2.06 at press time, reflecting a 3.10% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Analyst Explains Key Reasons Why Ethereum Could Revisit $1,000 This Cycle
URL: https://zycrypto.com/analyst-explains-key-reasons-why-ethereum-could-revisit-1000-this-cycle/
Time Published: 2025-04-07T20:17:09Z
Full Content:
Despite Ethereum (ETH) already suffering from bearish pressure and losing approximately 56% from its December 2024 high, Andrew Kang, partner at Mechanism Capital and former CFO at MicroStrategy, believes the decline may not be over. He predicts ETH could experience further significant losses and potentially revisit the $1,000-$1,500 range within the year. Revealing his sentiment on Sunday, Kang tweeted, “I haven’t paid close attention to crypto last few months but it seems high probability that ETH revisits $1000-1500 this year.” Notably, Kang’s assessment focuses on fundamentals, questioning the sustainability of Ethereum’s valuation given its current economics. “$215B market cap for a negative growth/profitability asset is ridiculous when it’s clear speculative winds have already blown past.” He added. This bearish outlook aligns with his consistent stance from last year when he compared Ethereum to Intel, suggesting the cryptocurrency had potentially already seen its peak. “Tell me how you pitch 200x PS, negative revenue growth, and negative profitability to investors at a $420B price,” he had challenged in a June 2024 post. At the time, he argued that while cryptocurrency enthusiasts might support such valuations, traditional finance institutions would be unlikely to invest heavily without improved economic indicators. The analyst has been notably accurate in previous predictions. When BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF application in June 2023, Kang was vocally bullish on Bitcoin at around $25,000, which subsequently returned 2.6x, while Ethereum returned 2.1x during the same period. To date, the pundit remains skeptical about Ethereum ETFs providing a similar upside, stating they would need “a compelling pathway to improve its economics.” Kang’s bearish tone aligns with that of other market observers. On Sunday, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Ethereum has broken out of a multi-year triangle pattern, setting $1,150 as the next major target. Earlier, Martinez also noted a concerning trend: Whale accounts on the Ethereum network have declined by 10% since February, dropping from 999 to 896. Approximately 500,000 ETH were sold by large holders between Wednesday and Thursday, suggesting a continued price drop. That said, not all analysts share this bearish outlook. Crypto Bullet told his 168,000 followers on X that Ethereum recently hit its 300-week Moving Average, a level previously reached only during the June 2022 bear market bottom. He suggested this represents “a very important support level” that could trigger a “good mid-term bounce” with a target of $2,900-$3,200. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital observed that Ethereum’s market dominance has plummeted from 20% to 8% since June 2023 while noting that historically, Ethereum has reversed from similarly low levels to regain market dominance. AT press time, ETH was trading at $1,559, reflecting a 3.81% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Larry Fink says we are 'probably' in a recession, but don't sell your stocks just yet

The CEO of the world's largest asset manager was asked whether he thinks a recession is coming. Larry Fink's response: We're in it. Most CEOs the BlackRock chief has been talking to "would say we are probably in a recession right now," he said Monday in an interview at the Economic Club of New York. "One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already," he said, adding that travel demand had declined. Last week, President Donald Trump made a tariff announcement that prompted trillions of dollars in value to be wiped from the stock market. He has made no indication that he will reverse his plans despite investors' pain. Fink raised concerns about inflation if all the proposed tariffs were put into effect simultaneously. He said this would make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, adding that there was "zero chance" of multiple rate cuts. "I'm much more worried that elevated inflation — that's going to bring rates up," he said. While Fink said he believed the markets could still fall by another 20%, he suggested that the conditions were "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity" in the long run as there are no systemic risks in the financial system. Longer term, Fink thinks Trump will focus on a growth agenda, like deregulation and tax cuts, he said: "The market is not focusing on these areas." Fink said the need to build up infrastructure in the US, especially for AI, is still a major investment theme that needs to play out. "If you spent time right now with the CEOs of the hyperscalers, Nvidia, and other players, they would say the need is just as great today as it was three months ago, and I believe some of the big macro trends are still in place," he said.

Title: Tariff Uncertainty Hurts Economy, Investors. History May Provide Clues

ByMike Patton ByMike Patton, Senior Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 10: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter after ... More signing a series of executive orders including 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, a pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, an order relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an order for the federal government to stop using paper straws and begin using plastic straws in the Oval Office at the White House on February 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump has signed more than 50 executive orders as of Friday, the most in a president's first 100 days in more than 40 years. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Stocks around the world continue to slide on President Donald Trump’s nuclear tariff option. The recent actions from Washington have served to elevate uncertainty, raise global fear, push stock prices down, and increase animosity against America. Does Trump have a master plan? Is there a historical lesson we can use to help understand what may come? Today’s tariffs have caused many to reflect to 1930, when President Herbert Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Although there are some differences between today’s tariff environment and the environment at that time, there are several similarities to consider. Here’s how the tariffs in 1930 unfolded. Senator Reed Smoot (R) and Representative Willis Hawley (R) were the two sponsors of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The U.S. House passed its version in May 1929 by a vote of 264 to 147, with 244 republicans and 20 democrats voting in favor of the bill. The following March (1930), the Senate passed its own version of the tariff bill by a vote of 44 to 42, with 39 republicans and five democrats. After merging the two bills, it was sent to Hoover’s desk for signature. Interestingly, Hoover was not in favor of the bill having campaigned, in part, on international cooperation. Additionally, over 1,000 economists urged Hoover to veto the bill, along with Henry Ford, Thomas Lamont of JPMorgan, and other business leaders. Despite opposition, congressional Republicans pressured Hoover to sign, and it was reported that Hoovers cabinet threatened to resign if he didn’t. Ultimately, Hoover succumbed to the pressure and signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act on June 17, 1930. After signing, retaliatory tariffs began. These counter measures were imposed on the U.S. by Canada, Cuba, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Canada also strengthened its trade ties with Great Britain. Actions from our trading partners, coupled with Smoot Hawley, helped create a vicious trade war, which led to a 66% drop in global trade between 1929 and 1934. Most economists and business leaders believe the Smoot-Hawley bill prolonged the Great Depression and made it much worse. The economic fallout from the 1930 tariffs hurt Republicans for decades as Democrats retained complete control of Congress for approximately 52 of the next 64 years. This issue was also a major reason Franklin Delano Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election. As mentioned, there are differences today, compared to 1930. Today, our economy is strong. At that time, the Great Depression had been in place for several months, so the economy was weak. Even though our economy is strong, the data indicating this measures the period prior to Trump’s tariff announcement. Currently, most corporate CEOs believe the U.S. economy is weakening and some believe we are already in recession. Trump’s Rose Garden announcement last Wednesday stated that the new tariffs were reciprocal. He showed a chart with figures on what other countries were charging the U.S. and how we were only going to charge them about half of that. Now we learn Trump’s tariffs are not reciprocal at all. According to experts, the formula used to derive the new tariff figures has little to do with reciprocation. It has more to do with the trade deficit with specific nations. But there’s more. Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, used Vietnam as an example. On CNBC Monday morning, Navarro said that even if Vietnam reduced its tariff on U.S. goods to zero, it would not be enough. He said it’s “non-tariff cheating that matters.” Navarro spoke about non-tariff barriers, including: 1) how much we buy compared to how much we sell to another country; 2) intellectual property theft; 3) the VAT tax; 4) currency manipulation, and a few other issues. Let’s look at some of these. The first item compares how much we buy from another country versus the amount they buy from us. Navarro referenced how for every $15 dollars in goods we buy from Vietnam, Vietnam only buys $1 from us. Trade deficits with other countries are only one of the factors built into the Trump tariff formula. Is this reasonable? The GDP of Vietnam is about $245.2 billion, similar in size to the economy of South Carolina ($246.3 billion). Vietnam is also much less wealthy than America. Should we expect that a small country with much less wealth, will buy the same amount of goods from us that we buy from them? Probably not. Especially since the need in America is far greater than that of Vietnam. Another item incorporated into the Trump tariff calculation involves the value added tax. A VAT tax is a tax imposed on goods and services. Think of it as a national consumption tax. In Europe, the VAT tax ranges from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary. Each country sets its own VAT tax rate in accordance with EU regulations. Navarro cited the VAT tax as another non-tariff barrier. The problem is, to expect all of Europe to eliminate the VAT tax is asking the region to radically alter its revenue collection system. This would require a change to EU’s regulations. Since Navarro referenced the VAT tax several times and said non-tariff barriers were the most important issues, don’t look for Europe to cave on this anytime soon. Therefore, if these non-tariff barriers are the most important issue, and Trump will not relent until these issues are resolved, the current trade war could continue for quite some time. And, like republicans in the 1930s, this could come back to bite them if they’re not careful. How do stocks react to tariffs? Let’s go back to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. When the depression began in 1929, stocks initially fell around 50%, then recovered about half their losses. After the Senate passed its tariff bill in March 1930, it was merged into the House version. Stocks peaked on Apr. 17, 1930, then began to fall to an ultimate bottom which was 89% lower than their peak in 1929. Today, stocks fell over 11.0% in the two days following the April 2 announcement. Despite only falling 11.0%, it could easily get worse if America fails to reach new deals with our trading partners. White House economic advisor Kevin Haslett, in an interview Monday morning, said Trump was considering a 90-day pause. The Dow Jones average rose 1,800 points in the next seven minutes on the news. Then Trump said that was “fake news” and stocks fell again. It’s impossible to know what to expect with such conflicting messages emerging from the White House. The biggest impediment to a thriving stock market is uncertainty. When corporations don’t know the rules, they sit on the sidelines until they do. Several companies are talking about layoffs. Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, believes the U.S. is already in recession. He said this sentiment is held by many CEOs he has spoken to. Are the tariffs a negotiating tactic or a longer term, revenue producer for the federal government? Both have been cited by the administration at various times, and both are at odds with each other. If the tariffs are a negotiating tactic, they will be short lived. In that case, it’s hard to see companies spending the time and money to build new facilities in the U.S. Why? Because it takes between three and five years from start to finish for a new plant to be up and running. If the tariffs remain for that long, the stock market and economy could experience significant pain. If the tariffs are designed to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and raise revenue, then negotiations today would be unnecessary. Trump has said the tariffs are both. Which is true? Perhaps no one knows, not even the president. The rules are changing daily. America has entered a period of great uncertainty with the economy teetering and stocks plummeting. Only time will tell if the outcome will be as the president has stated. In the meantime, all we can do is wait and see since no one really knows what’s going to happen.

Because the whole damn thing is FAKE AS HELL..earlier today it was up almost 1,000 points based on some BS rumor about Trump having a 90 day freeze on tariffs except China, then the second the White House said “Yeah thats total baloney” the stock went back down 800 points so what does that show, its all crooked phony nonsense I do not know the truth but it all looks fake to me. All I know there is now MEGA tons of cash sitting somewhere.... Funds were pulling out their money, near the end of summer, and into the fall. Plenty of recommendations and suggestions followed that. W. W. Granger investors pulled back, weeks ago. “Experts” said, that Nvidia valuation was in trouble (though NVDA has a very good profit margin), while “experts” kept chirping about Boeing (BA) that is overvalued and overpriced (more than NVDA), and without a profit margin. News headlines stirring the pot for calamity: TARIFFS! . . . that are negotiable. Hair on fire “stock momentum” in a tailspin: Financial Engineering, “Making a Market.” I was wondering the same thing. What’s the actual volume of sales compared to normal volume? Volume is higher than last week’s average. Wonder who put the rumor out? You bet. I SEC what you did there.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink says most CEOs he talks to think US is in a recession as markets roiled by Trump tariffs
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/07/business/larry-fink-says-most-ceos-he-talks-to-think-us-in-recession/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said stock markets could extend their decline by 20% as the US imposes steep tariffs, citing worries across Wall Street that the economy is probably already in contraction. Fink joined a chorus of prominent voices in the business community raising concerns that the US economy may already be slipping into a recession — a downturn directly linked to President Trump’s controversial trade policies. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink, who heads the world’s largest asset manager, stated bluntly during an event at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. He said recent stock market weakness was “more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” in the long run, and did not pose systemic risks. “That doesn’t mean we can’t fall another 20% from here too,” Fink said. Fink’s comments underscore growing alarm among top executives after Trump’s sweeping announcement of new tariffs last week triggered panic across global markets, sending the S&P 500 down 10% in just two trading sessions. The magnitude of the market reaction reflects widespread investor anxiety and confusion over the future direction of US trade policy. A recession is a period of significant decline in economic activity that lasts for more than a few months. It’s typically recognized by a drop in key indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), employment, consumer spending and business investment. While a common rule of thumb is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, economists and organizations like the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) look at a broader set of data to officially declare a recession. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. CNBC’s flash survey of chief executives in its CEO Council revealed the scale of corporate anxiety, with 69% of respondents forecasting an imminent recession and over half predicting the downturn will begin this year. While most anticipate the recession to be moderate or mild, their near-unanimous agreement is telling. One CEO described the downturn as “the Trump recession,” underscoring a sentiment echoed by many executives who blame current economic uncertainty squarely on presidential policy. The sudden escalation in trade tensions has also led JPMorgan Chase to increase its recession probability forecast for this year to 60%. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has openly expressed concerns about declining business confidence in the current climate. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch ally of Trump, warned that the world is on the brink of “self-induced economic nuclear winter” as he begged the commander-in-chief to pause his sweeping tariffs. The uncertainty created by tariffs has placed corporate America in an uncomfortable position, with 46% of CEOs surveyed admitting the tariffs would negatively impact their businesses. Another 36% remain unsure, cautiously “war rooming” potential scenarios. “We imagine that our suppliers will have to swallow part of the tariff, and we will have to pass on part of the tariff to our customers,” explained one CEO. “We are controlling what we can control, pricing and sourcing decisions. We can’t control the impact of tariffs on the consumer mindset, which we imagine could be significant.” Almost all executives from companies selling goods and services expect price increases of between 5% to 20%, with 82% preparing for a resurgence in inflation. CEOs warn these price hikes could dampen consumer spending — particularly among the vital 40-to-60-year-old demographic, whose spending power has been bolstered in recent years by stock market gains. The threat extends globally, as executives fear rising anti-American sentiment. One CEO whose company generates nearly half of its revenue overseas told CNBC: “The biggest issue I worry about is boycotts of American brands and anti-American sentiment. There is real backlash happening.” Another executive cautioned of “real potential for boycott of American goods,” warning it could trigger job cuts and stagflation. Trump and his administration continue to defend their aggressive stance, asserting that reshoring manufacturing to the US will ultimately offset short-term economic pain. But CEOs surveyed largely disagree: 45% believe reshoring will take a minimum of two years, if not longer. The White House remains unmoved, with Trump declaring: “Sometimes you have to take medicine.” The administration has also reiterated its goal of reducing America’s significant trade deficit with China. Despite these assurances, most executives strongly disagree that tariffs will lead to long-term economic gains — only a quarter expressed even mild agreement with Trump’s strategy. Ultimately, as former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard remarked, uncertainty itself may exacerbate economic downturn: “Who wants to invest when you don’t know what the rules are going to be?” One CEO summed up corporate sentiment succinctly: “All of the uncertainty with how it’s being handled will harm our business and limit investment until this is all concluded.” Advertisement

Title: Stagflation is America's most 'optimistic scenario' at this point, former Fed president says

Once painted as a worse-than-recession scenario, stagflation might now be the best that Americans can hope for with the trade war about to be in full swing. Bill Dudley, former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, says only one question remains: how bad will the damage be? Whereas a "Goldilocks economy" seemed alive and well at the start of this year, tariff policy has flipped the economic outlook in a matter of days. Writing in a Bloomberg opinion piece, Dudley said he expects devastating consequences from the White House's across-the-board tariffs. As dwindling demand derails US growth, 5% inflation is likely in the next six months, he said. Dudley added that a slowdown will occur even if Congress is able to implement tax cuts, "because there will be a considerable lag, and because low-to-moderate-income families, which tend to spend more of their income, will be hurt by tariffs more than helped by tax relief." Rising inflation in a cooling economy is the basis for stagflation. The scenario has no clear solution, making it a paralyzing situation for central banks. If central bankers raise interest rates to clamp down on inflation, they restrict economic growth. Cutting rates, meanwhile, could cause prices to spiral higher again. "All told, stagflation is the optimistic scenario. More likely, the US will end up in a full-blown recession accompanied by higher inflation," Dudley estimates. It's bound to be a no-win situation for stocks, he added. Since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Wednesday, indexes have tanked into bear market territory. "If companies pass along the cost of higher imports to consumers, inflation will be more persistent and the Fed less friendly. If they can't, profit margins will shrink and earnings will underwhelm. Not to mention the risk of foreign tariff retaliation." Of course, the Federal Reserve can hope the tariff inflation bump is temporary, an idea investors seem to agree with. Traders see the central cutting interest rates by 100 basis points through December, implying that growth will be the Fed's main concern. Dudley sees it differently. If Fed officials allow US inflation to remain above the 2% target rate — as has been the case for five years — it could amplify inflation expectations. Meanwhile, a tariff-induced productivity shock will historically impact inflation for longer, forcing the Fed to raise rates down the road. Others have taken the same stance. Rockefeller International Chair Ruchir Sharma warned that if the Fed chooses to stimulate growth with rate cuts, it would harm its reputation as a bulwark against inflation. "After missing its target for many years, it would be a mistake for the Fed to dismiss the inflation fallout from tariffs as transitory and revert once again to stimulating the economy," he wrote for the Financial Times. Not only might investors be wrong in expecting large-scale rate cuts this year, but one Wall Street heavy hitter warned that the Fed might tighten policy, instead. "This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday. Jump to

As recession fears grow, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager thinks one is already here — and he says he’s not alone. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” BlackRock (BLK-1.52%) CEO Larry Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York on Monday, in remarks reported by CNBC. Fink referred to the airline industry as a “canary in the coal mine.” “I was told that the canary is sick already,” he said. Fink added that he thinks President Donald Trump’s tariff policies could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as it usually does during recessions, which could exacerbate inflation. “This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that,” he said, according to CNBC (CMCSA-2.70%). “I’m much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that’s going to bring rates up much higher than they are today.” BlackRock has more than $11 trillion in assets under management across private and public investments. The S&P 500 is down 12.1% since March 7, while the Nasdaq Composite is down 14.1% during that same span. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market could see another 20% drop, but that the current drawdown is a buying opportunity in the long term as the current situation doesn’t pose systematic risk. “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go down further,” Fink said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin’s (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar. Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month. Stocks were hit even worse with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 13% and 15%, respectively.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Major figures in the business world have spent the last 48 hours sounding alarms about the economic consequences of President Donald Trump’s trade war — some even reversing their previous supportive stances. While many small businesses across the United States have for months decried Trump’s policies and the uncertainty they’ve injected into their operations, last week’s tariff rollout stunned America’s C-suites. In a CNBC flash survey of CEOs published Monday morning, 69% expected a recession, with 37% saying they expected to cut jobs this year. “Disappointingly stupid and illogical,” one CEO said in describing Trump’s tariffs to CNBC. “Without faith that our government knows what it is doing, it is impossible for businesses to thrive.” Speaking in a televised interview with Bloomberg, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the sentiments of the survey. “Most CEOs I talk to say we’re in a recession right now,” he said. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%. Dimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.” But he isn’t the only business leader changing his tune following steep market losses and a myriad of recessionary indicators. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said in an X post Monday morning that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team. The Pershing Square CEO also said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “profits when our economy implodes,” a statement he walked back hours later. “This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who also had officially endorsed Trump last summer. On Sunday, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said in a rare post on X — in response to another user posting a January interview on trade policy — that “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear.” Richard Branson, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Virgin Group, called on the Trump administration to “own up to a colossal mistake and change course” before the economic fallout spreads. “As the dollar is weakening, US consumer prices will rise,” Branson continued. “And countless small and medium-size enterprises will go, and already are going, bankrupt as a result. This is not a winning long-term strategy.” The uneasiness has even spread to Trump’s own circle of advisers. In what appears to be his first major break with the president, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a seemingly anti-tariff video on X on Monday morning featuring an economist lauding the “operation of the free market.” Musk also said Saturday during a speech at an event held by Italy’s right-wing co-ruling party that “Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and America.” In response, Peter Navarro — largely seen as the architect of Trump’s tariff policy — dismissed Musk as a “car assembler” in a CNBC interview Monday. “He’s a car person,” Navarro said. “That’s what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.” J.J.

Photo Credit: An image of the Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai PxHere The tourism category saw 45 individual foreign direct investment projects, making it the most active by project count among the top five sectors. Select a question above or ask something else Dubai attracted a record 1,117 foreign direct investment (FDI) for projects in 2024, maintaining its position as the top global destination for FDI for the fourth consecutive year, according to data from the Dubai FDI Monitor. Dubai attracted an estimated 52.3 billion Emirati Dirhams (approximately $14.2 billion) in FDI capital during 2024, a 33% increase from 39.26 billion Emirati Dirhams ($10.7 billion) in 2023. Hotels and tourism accounted for 14% of estimated foreign capital in 2024, equal to $2 billion, tied with real estate as the most heavily invested sector in Dubai. The tourism category saw 45 individual FDI projects, making it the most active by project count among the top five sectors. Real estate followed with 11 construction projects. In 2024, Dubai saw 18.7 million international visitors, up 9% from the previous year. For Dubai, India emerged as the top source of FDI capital for the first time, driven in part by real estate investments. The United States and Switzerland concentrated their capital in software, IT services, and tourism. In global terms, Dubai accounted for 6.2% of all FDI projects. Within the Middle East, it captured 55% of the region’s total. The data comes as Dubai pushes ahead with its D33 economic agenda, which includes a target of $177 billion in FDI over the next decade. The strategy focuses on positioning Dubai as one of the top three cities globally for both business and leisure — a goal that hinges in part on continued growth in tourism-related investment. Riyadh, which has been aggressively positioning itself as a regional investment hub, attracted 191 FDI projects in 2024. Despite high-profile efforts such as the creation of a dedicated FDI marketing ministry and the launch of a $5 billion investment partnership with BlackRock, Saudi Arabia’s capital is still far behind in converting global investor interest into actual project commitments. FDI is a hot topic in Saudi Arabia, especially regarding tourism projects. Multi-billion-dollar projects like Neom, Diriyah and Red Sea draw attention for the immense amount of public spending they have required. However, these projects are largely focused on the leisure market – religious tourism is the largest travel segment in Saudi by a wide margin. In January, Saudi opened up FDI into Makkah and Medina projects for the first time.

Title: The IPO slump is bad news for everyone

Good morning. JPMorgan Chase released CEO Jamie Dimon's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders. In the 58-page letter, Dimon said he sees stagflation dangers slowing the economy — and suggested that stock market pain may not be over. Dimon, a longtime meeting-hater, also offered tips on holding better ones. Read BI's takeaways here. In today's big story, public offerings were about to take off. Instead, they've hit the massive Trump Slump — and there's no end in sight. What's on deck Markets: Finance influencers share their advice amid Trump's tariffs. Tech: NYC's tech scene loves this cold-plunge and sauna studio. Business: Hollywood was hoping for a comeback in 2025. Now, those dreams are fading. But first, RIP to the IPO comeback. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's bad news for everyone. Just a few months ago, tech IPOs seemed primed for a comeback. "All signs were pointing to 2025 as the year when we would finally get some IPOs," said Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital. But a historic stock market sell-off, precipitated by Donald Trump's tariffs, has thrown cold water on those hopes. IPO analysts at Renaissance now estimate that as few as 150 deals could be made this year, making 2025 the fourth straight down year for IPOs. Another possible factor: Dreams of an IPO comeback may have been unrealistic from the start. Recent boom times led to the belief that public markets could ask for the moon — and get it, BI's Dakin Campbell writes. However, as outlooks have softened, investors still expect high returns from IPOs, resulting in many companies struggling to generate the enthusiasm needed for a successful public offering. As long as IPOs remain stagnant, average Americans have few ways to share in Silicon Valley's wealth. A slowdown in the IPO market limits the opportunities for mom-and-pop investors to directly take stakes in high-growth companies. That means there's less chance for them to strike it big with the next Facebook or Airbnb. The knock-on effect? Further deepening the divide between the stock market haves and have-nots. "Yet again, we are sequestering the majority of the upside of our prosperity to the private markets that consist mostly of 0.1 percenters and institutional investors," Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur and marketing professor at New York University, observed. So, what could spur a more robust market for IPOs? Analysts have some ideas, though it will likely involve companies lowering their valuations. 1. Mark Cuban says the US could be on track for a "worse situation" than 2008. In a series of Bluesky posts, Cuban suggested the extensive tariffs, combined with cuts to the federal workforce, could result in a worse financial crisis than the Great Recession. 2. Finance influencers on navigating tariffs uncertainty. BI asked nine finance influencers their top piece of advice amid tariff-related market instability. They shared budgeting, investing, and travel tips, but the No. 1 rule was "don't panic." 3. The trade war's silver lining. The 30-year mortgage rate dropped to its lowest point since October during the trade war chaos of last week. That's a bright spot for homebuyers — but it may not last long. 1. Tariffs chaos hits Amazon's atmosphere. President Trump's whiplash tariffs announcement is throwing the retail giant into uncertain territory. Amazon's stock was among the hardest hit on Thursday, and some employees, sellers, and vendors say the company has given them little guidance so far. 2. Building AI is about to get even more expensive. Most semiconductors are tariff-exempt, but what if the chips are inside other products? It may be time to rethink supply chains. 3. NYC techies <3 sweating and networking. The cold-plunge and sauna studio Othership is the hottest new spot for New York's tech scene, mixing wellness with socializing. It's open to more than just tech workers, though it was designed with them in mind. BI went inside. 1. TikTok's US teams are getting Chinese leaders, staffers say. A string of US executive exits left a management vacuum at TikTok, which employees say ByteDance's Chinese leaders are filling. However, this could change again if ByteDance sells TikTok to a new owner. 2. Hollywood's dashed dreams. Three months into 2025, Hollywood's hopes for a comeback are fading fast. Trump's tariffs, declining production, and more are casting a shadow on the industry's growth prospects. 3. The Chinese food "tsunami." A slew of authentic Chinese restaurant brands are coming to the US, but geopolitical tensions and anti-Asian sentiment persist. Could the cuisine bridge divides between the two countries, or is it set up to fail? The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: Surveying The Landscape Of Institutional DeFi
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/07/surveying-the-landscape-of-institutional-defi/

BySean Lee BySean Lee, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images A term that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, “Institutional DeFi” is widely predicted to be one of the defining themes of the digital asset sector in 2025 – and perhaps even the rest of the decade. If that seems far-fetched, just ask JPMorgan. The banking behemoth recently published a report subtitled “The Next Generation of Finance?” into the potential benefits of adopting decentralized financial protocols for the TradFi sector One point that stands out from the report is a relatively strict definition of institutional DeFi as “the application of DeFi protocols to tokenized real-world assets, combined with appropriate safeguards to ensure financial integrity, regulatory compliance, and customer protection,” going on to note an explicit exclusion – institutional players participating in “crypto DeFi.” According to this definition, JPM’s own tokenization efforts, based on its Kinexys Digital Assets platform, which is used to offer intra-day repo settlement, would be included. (It’s worth noting that tokenized repo settlements are projected to reach $1 trillion in the coming years, according to Citi.) However, any institutional activity in the established DeFi sector –including the $60 billion surge in DeFi activity recently observed by institutional custodian Fireblocks – would be excluded. On the one hand, crypto DeFi still operates in a regulatory no-man’s land, meaning many institutions will understandably be keen to distance themselves for compliance reasons. Various efforts have been underway to solidify regulator’s understanding of DeFi, and to recommend policy frameworks that can balance innovation and investor protection. Examples of such include IOSCO’s “Final Report with Policy Recommendations for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)”, and the Crypto Council for Innovation’s “Key Elements of an Effective DeFi Framework”, in which I was a contributor. So in time, regulatory clarity for DeFi will happen. Just not yet. With that said, crypto DeFi is the very place where the innovation happens as the barriers between institutions and crypto-native DeFi are increasingly hard to define as banks increasingly look to the benefits of public decentralized infrastructure to issue their tokenized assets. For instance, a given blockchain ecosystem such as Polygon or Aptos is currently being used in multiple ways. JPMorgan itself has experimented with permissioned iterations, while other firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock are using the public architecture for issuing their tokenized money market funds. All alongside an established ecosystem of native crypto DeFi apps. For institutional DeFi and native DeFi to play together, safeguards will be a non-negotiable necessity for TradFi players. However, a key question is: How eager are the innovators in DeFi willing to go along with the idea of rules and regulations? A ruling in the eleventh hour of the Biden administration that would compel DeFi platforms to implement KYC checks was met with predictable howls of dismay from industry insiders, indicating that resistance is still strong in some quarters. Even if such a ruling is now obsolete under the new administration, it’s safeguards such as these that would potentially unlock institutional access to crypto DeFi. And according to the recent JPMorgan report, “the prize for innovators who hone [institutional DeFi] for use in the world’s trillion-dollar finance industry could be substantial.” A key argument espoused by the crypto and broader tech sector is that regulation stymies innovation. However, the reality is that the institutional DeFi opportunity is already stimulating innovation and industry development towards the kind of safeguards that institutions would demand. One of the often-discussed areas where DeFi falls short is in compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. Thus, permissioned DeFi solutions were among the first to emerge, heavily supported by crypto-native institutional providers such as Ripple Custody and Fireblocks, among others. However, this is only part of the equation explaining why take-up has been slow. Data privacy is also a compliance requirement at odds with the public nature of blockchain transactions and the ease with which large transactions can be traced. The extension of zero-knowledge technologies into blockchain privacy, along with the development of innovations such as iExec’s decentralized confidential computing, which uses hardware-based trusted execution environments, could bridge the gap between public blockchains and institutional privacy standards. Another bridge is needed between institutional models for organization, governance, and conduct, and the decentralized finance segment, where governance is managed through token ownership, and often, there is no figurehead by design. However, at this point in its evolution, the crypto sector arguably has its own institutions in the form of exchanges like Crypto.com or the other giants that also have a foot in the decentralized segment via their associated blockchain projects, such as the Cronos chain. These established firms, which have often courted institutional clients themselves, will have an important role to play in bringing together institutions and DeFi from their respective sides of the divide. The benefits of institutional DeFi are becoming too great to ignore, but the institutions themselves are invariably cautious about excessive risk, meaning they are keen to keep crypto DeFi at arm’s length. However, as the source of the innovation, DeFi developers have an opportunity to share in the benefits of institutional DeFi, assuming they remain open to the kind of safeguards that will make it possible for TradFi to collaborate.

Title: Farewell, Fugazy!

Time Published: 2025-04-07T11:40:58Z
Full Content:
That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication.

To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out. A much-appreciated note of optimism this Monday morning. Now, if we can just find a solution to the unlawful obstruction of executive prerogative by a subversive judiciary ….. One of your best ever, JK!👍👍 This post perfectly encapsulates where we are as a country today. Think about the private equity industry, which specializes in buying companies, layering on cheap debt and pretending that this creates value while producing nothing - Fugazy indeed! While I’m a Boomer, I recognize that we must right the ship, lest the country be lost for future generations. We’ve already saddled them with debt beyond belief. Time to stop the money printing presses and get back to being a producer nation. No posts Ready for more?
