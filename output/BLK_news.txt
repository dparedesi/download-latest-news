We have an ongoing love affair with Marlborough sauvignon in this country. Those lifted aromas, bright fresh fruit and zingy lime acidity are a winning combination that draws us back time after time. It has been 50 years since the first grapevines were planted in Marlborough, and the region has expanded hugely in that period. So what is it that makes this wine so special? As every visitor is warned, New Zealand has high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that requires the application of sun block on a regular basis. This UV light allows grapes to ripen at lower temperatures, thereby retaining acidity, while the constant wind (“our secret weapon”, one winemaker told me) keeps temperatures down. In addition, the cool night-time temperatures and warm days allow the grapes to ripen slowly and evenly. Marlborough, named “Kei puta te Wairau” or “the place with the hole in the cloud” by the Māori has even less cloud cover and more sunshine than other parts of the country. However, similar conditions can also be found in other parts of New Zealand and with other grape varieties too. Waipara and Nelson, both a short drive from Marlborough, produce some great white wines, including sauvignon. But New Zealand grows a range of other white grapes (as well as some reds) including Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris and even Albariño. All of these share the same lively acidity and succulent ripe fruit that make them a great food-friendly alternative to sauvignon blanc. One of each grape variety is featured below. Lightly honeyed with succulent textured nectarines, orchard fruits and vibrant acidity. This would go nicely with Asian prawn dishes. From Lidl Enticing aromas, with crisp red and green apple fruits, lively citrus acidity, a honeyed touch and a lip-smacking dry finish. This would be great with most seafood, creamy cheeses and summery salads. From wineonline.ie; 64wine, Glasthule and Mount Merrion Zesty, snappy green apple and peach with mandarin peel.

(OTC: GRLT), a leading luxury real estate development firm, today announced its full-year financial results for 2024, marking a transformative year following the successful merger with Primior Inc. The company reported $2.67 million in total revenue, a 425% increase in EBITDA, a strengthened gross margin of 87%, and a major investment in real estate tokenization technology. With total assets reaching $29.37 million, Primior continues to expand its footprint in luxury real estate development and technology-driven investment strategies. Primior Holdings Inc. Reports Strong 2024 Performance: $2.67M Revenue and Pioneering Advances in Real Estate Tokenization “These results demonstrate Primior’s ability to scale operations while improving profitability and strategically investing in the future,” said Johnney Zhang, CEO of Primior Holdings Inc. “Our 425% EBITDA growth reflects strong operational execution, while our investment in Gaia, our asset tokenization platform, is setting the foundation for next-generation real estate investment. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value through expansion, innovation, and financial strength.” 2024 Financial Performance Highlights Balance Sheet Strength & Liquidity Gaia: Primior’s Strategic Investment in Asset Tokenization A key highlight of the year was Primior’s $750,000 investment in the research and development of Gaia, the company’s asset tokenization-as-a-service platform. Gaia aims to revolutionize real estate investing by enabling fractional ownership of assets via blockchain technology, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in property investment. We plan to continue investing a significant portion of our earnings into the development of Gaia, as we believe tokenization is the future of the market.

This platform is poised to disrupt the financial market and fundamentally change how people own real estate in the future. Investor Outlook: Shares Poised for Higher Valuation With total assets of $29.37 million and 3.85 billion outstanding common shares, this equates to an approximate asset value of $0.0076 per share—a figure that reflects Primior’s strong real estate holdings but not yet its full growth potential. Additionally, earnings per share (EPS) of $0.00031 provide a baseline that does not fully account for anticipated revenue growth from new developments, Gaia’s launch, and ongoing operational efficiencies.

Title: Reports: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Requests Military Options for Unfettered Panama Canal Access

Full Content:
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked defense officials to “provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal,” according to reports. CNN reported that the request was outlined in a memo sent to senior leaders titled “Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance,” which replaces the 2022 National Defense Strategy and will guide the Department of Defense in line with President Donald Trump’s vision. NBC News reported that U.S. Southern Command presented draft strategies to Hegseth this week and that potential strategies include “simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it.” Other options reportedly under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks. Trump’s goal is to take control of the 50-mile canal and counter China’s growing influence over the area, out of concern China could shut down the canal to American shipping and the U.S. military in the event of a conflict. Banana declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China after Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino to reduce Chinese influence or face potential retaliation. Hegseth will reportedly visit Panama next month. Last week, Trump said, “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” As NBC News reported, BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90 percent stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion. An official told NBC News the U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, some of them Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats. CNN reported that Hegseth’s memo outlined the Trump administration’s priorities as securing the U.S. border, reinforcing the U.S.’s presence in the Western Hemisphere, and focusing on China. It also reportedly called for European allies to step up as “allies — not dependents,” called for providing military aid to Israel and continuing to arm Arabian Gulf partners, and called for greater military cooperation between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states.

Title: Trump’s Restructuring of the U.S. Empire – Tariffs, Eliminating USAID, Ending Ukraine War and more. Jack Rasmus

The policies animating sectors of the world, from the Democratic benches in Washington, to the Mainstream corporate media, to EU leaders throughout Europe, are shaking up the globe. They could lead to the end of NATO as we have known it. America gobbling up land masses in the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, and more. Dr. Jack Rasmus says that this is not an instance of Trump losing his mind. It is a determined decision to restructure the U.S. economy – the fourth in a series of other restructurings that took place since 1917-1918. The following is an excerpt of the entire discussion carried out between Dr. Rasmus and Michael Welch on the Global Research News Hour on Friday March 14. Dr. Jack Rasmus, Ph.D Political Economy, was a former teacher of economics at St. Mary’s College in California. He is the author and producer of the various nonfiction and fictional workers, including the books The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy From Reagan to Bush, Clarity Press, October 2019; Alexander Hamilton & The Origins of the Fed, Lexington books, March 2019; and Central Bankers at the End of Their Ropes: Monetary Policy and the Coming Depression. Jack is the host of the weekly radio show, Alternative Visions, on the Progressive Radio Network, and a journalist writing on economic, political and labor issues. His site is jackrasmus.com and his twitter handle is @drjackrasmus. Global Research: Greenland and the Panama Canal were threatened with annexation, possibly with military force by Trump. Is America turning back to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine imperial conquest, or are they making nightmare threats to get a less harsh goal? Jack Rasmus: No, the empire is consolidating, restructuring. You know, we’ve had these periodic restructurings of the American empire for over a century now. World War I was the first as the U.S., after it finished its first imperial foray offshore the continent with the Spanish-American War, 1898-1903. You know, that war was funded by taxing property owners, and it didn’t go over very well. And the U.S. imperialists knew that, you know, if they were going to participate in a conflict in Europe, which was imminent by 1912, that they would have to restructure. They could not participate in that, and nor could the U.S. empire, now beginning to economically move offshore, really play with the European empires if it did not have a position in terms of its currency and its military. So what happened in World War I was we created a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was really dominated and run by the New York banks. That’s why the New York Fed to this day handles all the international transactions and the currency issues, you see. It’s kind of like the central bank within the central bank. And we created a new fiscal system based upon the corporate income tax, which, by the way, taxed mostly the rich. The working class was not covered because they weren’t making enough money by the income tax in 1916-17. So we had a new fiscal monetary policy. And after World War I, of course, the U.S. dollar became the co-currency along with the British pound, and the U.S. stepped on to the global stage. Well, another restructuring occurred with World War II. And in that one, obviously, the dollar and the U.S. became the hegemonic economy and country in the world. The Brits and the French had to pretty much sign over their empires to the U.S. They kept vestiges of it and then lost that. And we had a new monetary policy and a new fiscal policy, a new industrial policy, and a new external policy. So every time you have a restructuring, it’s usually related to the empire either expanding its role, participating, or the third restructuring, which followed in the wake of the collapse economic crisis of the 1970s, economic and political. A third restructuring has been called neoliberalism, occurred late 70s, early 80s, and expanded in various ways throughout it. We had a new mix of fiscal, monetary, industrial, external policies that enabled the U.S. empire to expand once again. It was really a class-based policy, neoliberalism, and it was about taming its capitalist challengers, which were Japan and Europe at the time, and weakening its non-capitalist challenger, the Soviet Union. It proved to be successful. It also was successful in attacking working class and their unions in the U.S. and the social movements and so forth. So it was very successful imperial policy. That’s how you need to understand neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, I’ve always said, is kind of an obfuscating term. It’s really about imperialism and class-based politics. So that neoliberalism succeeded for several decades, but then the contradictions, as I argue in my new book, began to intensify in the 21st century. And since the 2008 crash, and then the 2020 crash, and in between slow growth, what we’ve had is an increasing inability of the neoliberal policies to deliver for the empire. And what we have today is the empire as it’s structured here in the neoliberal period is unaffordable. They’ve got to restructure it with the purpose of reducing the cost or moving the costs to areas of the empire that are considered more fundamental and more strategic. The U.S. has decided, at least this wing under Trump, has decided that the Ukraine war at $350 billion is a waste of money. The trillions of dollars thrown into the Middle East with the war against terrorism and certain countries hasn’t produced significant results. And NATO is a waste of money. NATO doesn’t need, we don’t need to keep providing a security umbrella to Europe. And that’s what Trump keeps saying. He says, pay your own way. I mean, you know, you’re rich enough. Why are we paying your way? Well, we’re paying their way so they can maintain these nice social program and benefits for their population because they don’t have to fund a defense. Now, of course, they’re trying to realize they have to do that now. And what we’re going to see in Europe is funding warfare at the expense of welfare. That’s coming. And even their media is talking about that, Financial Times and others. So that’s in progress right now. We can return to that topic. But what it means is that the U.S. is cutting its costs, you know, whether it’s NATO, whether it’s Ukraine, whether it’s the Middle East, whether it’s the 800 bases around the world, whether it’s USAID and NED and all the other wasted expenditures, which are part of the empire. And it’s looking back into the Western Hemisphere and saying, well, you know, we’ve got to shore up our strategic homeland here, which is North America, Western Hemisphere. And that’s how you got to understand Greenland and the Panama Canal. You see, this isn’t crazy Trump. This is very conscious policy. They know what they’re doing here. What they’re doing in Greenland is they’re trying to, America’s trying to develop an Arctic strategy. It’s way behind the curve with Russia’s Arctic strategy, which is well developed. The U.S. virtually has no Arctic strategy, even though it has Greenland at the western side of its Arctic. I mean, Alaska, it wants Greenland at the eastern side. Right. And then, of course, it’s got to somehow get the northern Canadian territories in shape here for that Arctic strategy, because as the Arctic clearly is, you know, the ice cap is disappearing, it’s opening up a transition, a pathway for Russia and especially China to Europe. That’s a strategic estuary or whatever you want to call it there on the western side of Greenland. So, the U.S. wants to consolidate that in Arctic strategy, control, basically prevent the flow of Chinese commercial shipping through that pathway there. And there are rare earths in Greenland that they want to exploit. Panama is similar. Panama is about checking China. You see, China has been buying up properties and deepening its influence within the Panamanian government. And the U.S. is no, no, no. And it’s already taken moves, put pressure on the Panamanian government, which has cut a number of projects, economic projects, with China as a result. Also, the Panama Canal needs to be enlarged significantly. And Panama doesn’t have the money and doesn’t want to do the enlargement. Why? Because the new Ford class U.S. aircraft carriers can’t make it through the canal as it exists. So, it’s strategic in that sense. And in the latest development, BlackRock recently just bought up the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal as the beginning of this. And the Panamanian government is backing down and talking about more U.S. control and influence of the canal itself. So, both the canal and Greenland are part of long-term strategic moves to check Russia and to check China. And that’s how it should be seen. And to talk about the 51st state of Canada is really to put pressure on Canada, I think, to really go along with the developing of a Northern Arctic strategy and also as a way of Trump raising funds through tariffs in order to also help fund the restructuring of the empire. You see, it’s not just saving foreign aid and foreign adventures and unnecessary expenditures abroad, but it’s also the tariffs, the primary objective. There’s two objectives of Trump’s tariffs. One is to politically browbeat allies and whomever for political objectives. Like in Mexico, it’s all about really the immigration and fentanyl flows and so forth. And it works. It works. Well, we saw the same thing with Panama. It works because Trump found in his first term, even though his trade strategy failed to check China, it did raise significant revenues. And Biden continued those revenues, by the way. And Trump sees revenues as a key way of reducing the debt and the budget deficit by raising revenues, but also as a way of moving the expenditure cuts, whether they’re in Europe or wherever, or whether you raise money, to move that money into new weapons investments. You see, the US is way behind China and even Russia in drone technology and in hypersonics and ballistic missiles and so forth, and AI and so forth. Well, it’s pretty much in a big competition with China for AI. But there’s a lot of crash weapons programs that need to be funded, and the empire structure cannot fund it now because it’s throwing away all hundreds of billions of dollars every year in places that aren’t strategic to US interests anymore. Ukraine is not strategic to US interests, and even conflict with Russia is not strategic Russia per se. The big challenge to the empire is the BRICS and the Global South, which is really the most serious challenge, I think, to the empire, certainly even more so than both Japan and Europe and Soviet Union during the 80s. The Global South in the 80s was a non-entity. It was undeveloped, and it was pretty much exposed to whatever pressures the US wanted to put on it, economic or political. Well, that’s not the case today. The Global South is industrialized. It’s a major player in the world now, and it’s the future major player. And the BRICS could undermine the dollar and the currency and international payment system and so forth. And I think the Trump wing of the capitalists realize that, and they’re trying to orient to the Global South. But to do that, they got to put this Ukraine nonsense to bed, you see. And then they got to pull financially out of Europe, which they’re going to do. And the Europeans, of course, see this, and they’re panicking, right? Because now they got to raise their own industry, their own weapons industry, which is virtually non-existent, especially next generation technology weapons like AI and so forth. Europe’s not even a game when it comes to AI. 90% of all the AI patents are filed by the US and China. So Europe is the backwater of technology right now. It’s the backwater of banking. Its industry development lags the US in a whole number of ways. The US is making Europe a dependency, an economic dependency, not just because of sanctions and blowing up the Nord Stream thing, which made them dependent on US gas and oil, but driving Russia out of the European economy altogether, in which American companies are flooding in the vacuum. But US policies that have to do with taxes, even under Biden, tax policies were passed that’s just sucking money capital out of Europe right now. And on top of that, we got the tariffs now, the tariff policies, right? And on top of that, you’ve got Europe saying, we’re going to remilitarize, we’re going to develop weapons, we’re going to spend $800 billion to develop a weapons industry, which is at the tip of the iceberg, by the way. Germany is going to spend $500 billion just on infrastructure, who knows how much more for weapons. So we have this massive weapon industrialization going on in Europe. But Europe can’t produce the weapons, at least for another five years. It takes that long to really develop these factories, plus they’re way behind in AI and will remain behind. So what’s all this about? Well, the US is going to pull out of Europe and the NATO bases and that wasted expenditure. But guess what? The Europeans are going to raise bonds and raise money. And where are they going to get the weapons in the meantime? From the US. But they’re going to pay full market price now, you see. That’s the difference. Well, it will make Europe even more dependent on the US economically. This whole war with Russia was really about debilitating the Russian economy and regime change. Well, that didn’t work at all. In fact, quite the opposite happened, but it weakened Europe. And I kind of think that was always the plan B of the United States with this war anyway, make Europe dependent on it, drive Russia out of Europe altogether, not just out of energy, right? And make Europe dependent on US industry and US banks. And that’s happening. That’s happening as we speak. So the US does not have to throw money at Europe anymore, does not want to. It needs to develop its own weapons industry even more. It needs to take care and consolidate the empire in the Western Hemisphere once more. And it needs to orient toward taking care of its lake called the Pacific Ocean, you see. So that’s what’s happening. It’s a restructuring a la 1980s economic restructuring, a la World War II, 1944, Bretton Woods, a la you know, 1917-18. The empire goes through these periodic restructurings. It changes the mix of its economic policies. It forges new political institutions, global. And that’s how you must see what’s going on. Now, the problem in the US is the whole capitalist class is not united around that particular vision. You still got the old guard, the Democrats and a huge bureaucracy that’s blown up after 50 years in the US of the empire neoliberalism, right? They’re fighting back. They don’t want to change anything. They wanted to keep everything the way it is. Well, you’ve got this domestic element of this restructuring, which is, well, we’re going to cut cost the government and we’re going to move it somewhere else. And the Democrats don’t want to do that. They want to keep the, I mean, they are totally blind and terribly led and have no alternative to what’s going on, except no change, keep it the same, keep it the same. And of course, the bureaucracy likes that because the bureaucracy has done quite well. It’s really expanded over the last 40, 50 years. So you got this alliance between the Democrats and the old bureaucracy, and you got Trump, which is more than just MAGA now. They’re all signed of a new coalition there, and they want to change things. And it’s going to be a protracted fight here for some time to come. GR: Jack Rasmus, in terms of this stage of restructuring, having to face new realities in the empire and so on and so forth, I have to also ask about restructuring for whom? I mean, when he was inaugurated, Donald Trump had 13 billionaires in his camp, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk is a major player in his team. I remember Michel Chossodovsky talking about how the COVID crisis was the excuse, he says, deliberately planned to engineer a broad economic depression, cancel millions of jobs, impoverish people with the lockdowns, and then appropriate and redistribute the wealth that remains among the wealthy. And according to a 2022 report by Oxfam International, while 263 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty that year, the world’s billionaires saw their collective wealth go up by $12.7 trillion. That’s about 42% what they had during the pandemic. Now, effectively, it’s like the 1929 stock market crash, right? Now, is this new restructuring of the U.S. economy actually being designed specifically for the status of the billionaire class in America in mind? I mean, make sure the Americans know who’s really in charge in this new restructured America, in other words. JR: Well, you know, they certainly benefit from all this, and their interest pushing it means even more money for them. So you can’t separate out the advantages and the benefits that flow to the very rich, the capitalists and the billionaires and the tech, you know, the new leading edge of capitalism. And they lever it, they take advantage of it. And, you know, that’s part of the deal to get it pushed through. You can’t separate out their interests and the whole restructuring because they’re the big beneficiaries of the whole thing. They make money when wars are started and they make money when wars are ended. And that’s what’s going on in Ukraine. You know, all this talk about minerals and everything. And the deal is really about how we’re going to, quote, redevelop what’s left of Ukraine and who’s going to really get that money. Well, it’s going to be the capitalists who get the money. Europe has its pot of money called the Russian assets, 300 billion, right? Well, the U.S. doesn’t have a pot to pay its capitalists to redevelop Ukraine. That’s what this 500 billion is about. Create a pot, right? Some of it will go to, you know, U.S. capitalists who are already deeply entrenched in Ukraine, by the way, and they’ll get that money just as the European capitalists will get some of the Russian money, right? That’s how they make money off of ending wars, just as they make money off of starting them. So I don’t think it’s a question of either war or what came first. You know, the capitalists saying, you know, Peter Thiel and all those guys saying, well, we want you to do this, Trump. It’s a very fluid thing where, you know, certain people for domestic reasons and for economic reasons and for foreign policy reasons sort of come together. Some of the many may not even know of this bigger picture, but, you know, conditions push them along in that direction. You know, as far as the COVID thing, yeah, they made a lot of money. The billionaires made a lot of money. That’s documented. That’s fact. Well, how did they make the money? Well, mostly they made it off of financial assets. Well, how did they get it off of financial assets? Well, the monetary policy was such that it gave them free money. You know, the Fed gave $4 trillion more to bankers and investors. They didn’t need it because this, you know, the COVID thing wasn’t like 2008 where you had the financial system collapse, where they threw $4 trillion to prevent the further collapse. No, no. The banks and the financial system was not in trouble in 2020, but they threw $4 trillion at them anyway. They took advantage of the crisis, you see, and stocks just blew right through the whole COVID thing in the last two years. Stock markets are up, what, 50 to 65 percent just in two years, last two years. So, yeah, these policies benefit, are always benefiting the very wealthy, especially the finance capitalists and the technology companies and the energy companies, these leading edge in the capitalist class. You know, your local real estate guys aren’t big players in all this, but the big capitalists always benefit from this. And yeah, they took advantage. I don’t know if they told Trump, you know, what to do here. You know, it’s kind of hard to make those connections, but you, it’s obvious you’ve got a huge smoking gun. The 2008-09 policies benefited them tremendously. The 2021 policies, in which, by the way, we spent $10 trillion. 2021, 6.7 trillion in fiscal stimulus, another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus, $10 trillion. And what did we get for the economy in the full two years that the economy was open, 22, 23, 24? We barely got 2% GDP growth. So, we threw $10 trillion at the economy to get an average, historical average, GDP growth, which means fiscal and monetary policy are broken in this country. That’s part of the contradictions you see of neoliberalism. They’re just not working anymore, but boy, are they funneling the wealth, both through monetary and fiscal policy, into the hands of the billionaires and all of them below them on the capitalist pyramid. GR: Would you care to comment on the selection of Mark Carney as the new leader of the Liberal Party and, you know, ultimately the new Prime Minister of Canada? I mean, he was a former Goldman Sachs banker and the governor of the Bank of Canada and the governor of Bank of England, and he reportedly directed the Canadian government on how to avoid the effects of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. On the tariffs from Donald Trump, Carney had said the following, I believe. He said that, well, he said he would go with the dollar-for-dollar tariffs and, in fact, aim it at them with the least impact on Canadians. So, do you think this is the best strategy for avoiding or diminishing the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs? JR: Well, I see Carney as put in place there by the finance capitalists, who are not just Canadian finance capitalists, but, you know, finance capitalism just sort of breaches country boundaries, right? They want a normal, quote, normal controlled change in the restructuring of the tariff and external policies. You know, Trudeau was just a big problem. Trudeau was just aggravating the hell out of Trump, and he was a big drag on trying to contain and control the whole process of the restructuring and tariff policy going on. Carney is a person who, you know, will work closely with his finance capitalist cousins in the US and Canada and elsewhere, and they will try to bring some rationale to the whole process of what’s going to happen with tariffs and other policies as well. So, you know, the capitalists see him as the right guy to sort of tame and control the whole process that’s going to happen. Trudeau was just going to aggravate it. He was going to maybe take it out of control, you know, and cause, you know, extreme tit for tat. We saw the same exchange, you know, with Ford and Trump, you know, Ford, the Ontario guy there, saying, oh, we’re going to put tariffs at 25% on your electricity. So Trump just, you know, bumps it up to 50%. You know, he sends a signal to him, you know, you better get this guy out of the picture, right? Let’s talk with Carney and, you know, there’ll be a settlement. There will be some increase in what Canadians are going to have to pay with the tariffs, but it will be controlled. It will be kept in a reasonable range. And that’s what I see Carney as the selection and what his role will be.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $84,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. BTC topped $85,000 for the first time in five days earlier in the day before retreating. "Some renewed macro stability is seeing Bitcoin and crypto recover in tandem other risk assets," Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at crypto advisory FRNT Financial, wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt. "Lower than expected inflation numbers, perception that geopolitical risk is easing, among other factors, are contributing to an easing of macro anxieties and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin." Savic noted that some Bitcoin bulls had "certainly used the opportunity to buy the dip...contributing to this recovery." Bitcoin's rise came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would vote for a Republican measure that would fund the government. A shutdown might have further unsettled markets already rocked by mounting evidence that the U.S. economy was headed for stagflation, in which growth slumps while prices rise. Risk-on assets of all stripes have been swooning for weeks as the country wrestles with the growing prospect of a trade war instigated by U.S. President Trump's tariffs on its biggest trading partners, controversial government cost-cutting measures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, the University of Michigan Sentiment Consumer Index, a measure of confidence in the economy, fell to its lowest level since 2022. The same survey showed expectations for inflation also increasing to their highest point in more than two years. BTC's rise returned the asset to over its 200-day average just a day after it had fallen below the widely watched measure for the first time in more than six months. The average is a favored indicator among investors to consider Bitcoin's longer-term prospects. Other major crypto assets were trading well into positive territory with Solana and Chainlink recently rising 9% and over 6% from Thursday, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Solana has been buffeted in recent weeks as meme coins which favor the blockchain have plummeted. Ethereum, which has also lost ground in recent weeks, rose more than 3.5%. Major equity indexes closed upward with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The S&P had dropped into correction territory the previous day, meaning it had dipped at least 10% from its previous high. Gold, a traditional risk-off asset, which spiked above $3,000 for the first time in its history on Thursday, sank below the threshold on Friday. In a text to Decrypt, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote that the Unversity of Michigan survey had likely pushed "investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge," and noted that BlackRock had resumed Bitcoin purchases with a $25 million investment, "reinforcing institutional confidence." But he warned of "volatility and possible significant corrections ahead."

This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. Will they do it this time? Meanwhile: What’s that in the sky? An IPO, a new ETF? Turns out it’s both. Real world wins for Coinbase Things keep falling into place for Coinbase. This week alone, the company saw a lawsuit against it in Vermont dropped and got approval to offer its services in India. Now, onlookers are watching to see if Coinbase will get the green light to offer tokenized securities. It’s something the company has wanted to do since before it went public in 2021. If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment. The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain? Currently, BlackRock has dominated the RWA space. Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries. In the past month alone, RWAs grew by 18% to $18.3 billion, according to rwa.xyz. RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account. But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe. Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. That’s about to change. https://t.co/WCUfDnu6SP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 10, 2025 This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.” And as of the end of 2024, cash generated from operations had ballooned to $2.5 billion. That means that revenue stream has more than doubled from $922 million in 2023. On Friday afternoon, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, closed at 183.12, up 3.17% on the day. Up, IPO and away! There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week). Last night, crypto exchange Gemini flew a Guinness World Record-breaking “aerial display of a cryptocurrency logo formed by multirotor/drones” in Austin, Texas. What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO? PROOF OF RECORD pic.twitter.com/0tno2sY1UN — Gemini (@Gemini) March 14, 2025 People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. That means Gemini is the first to make the jump from the rumored IPO list—which includes stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Bullish, Kraken, and Blockchain.com—into the actual race. If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column. Wen buy Bitcoin? It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy. The company, which recently changed its name from MicroStrategy and trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, has seen its Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24. At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin. And bettors aren't optimistic the company will announce a surprise buy over the weekend. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD doubt that Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, estimating a 76% chance that the firm’s holdings remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) On Friday afternoon, Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, closed at 297.49, up a whopping 13% today. Other keys Asset manager Rex Shares is nothing if not creative. On Friday, the company launched an ETF to bring Startegy’s Bitcoin-backed bond offering to the everyman. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.” Earlier in the week, Rex and Osprey Funds applied to offer an ETF that would track the price of MOVE, the Movement Network token that launched in November. It’s also the same firm that filed to offer ETFs linked to Official Trump (TRUMP), BONK, and Dogecoin. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Coming After SEC Lawsuit Ends, Predicts Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-coming-after-sec-lawsuit/
Time Published: 2025-03-14T19:30:49Z
Full Content:
Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has stoked fresh speculation around potential altcoin-focused ETFs for XRP and Solana by BlackRock. In a series of comments posted today on X, Geraci asserted his belief that the world’s largest asset manager will eventually add both crypto assets to its growing portfolio of exchange-traded funds. “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” Geraci wrote, adding that he believes, “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” He elaborated on BlackRock’s motivations, noting: “BlackRock is currently the leader by assets in both bitcoin & ether ETFs… I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s prediction marks a significant shift from BlackRock’s previously stated position on expanding its cryptocurrency ETF lineup. In July last year, Samara Cohen, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no plans to launch ETFs other than Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future. Several months later, in December, Jay Jacobs—BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs—clarified that the $10 trillion asset manager was primarily focused on its existing crypto offerings, indicating that altcoin-based ETFs were not on the company’s immediate roadmap. Despite BlackRock’s earlier reservations, industry analysts have highlighted growing demand for altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs), including those tracking Solana and XRP. In January, banking giant JPMorgan released projections in January suggesting that a green light for these ETPs could trigger inflows of up to $14 billion in their first year alone. According to the report, Solana-related ETPs could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in assets within 6 to 12 months, while XRP-based products could garner between $4 billion and $8 billion over the same timeframe—assuming a favorable regulatory environment. As of March 13, 2025, nine issuers have submitted their respective applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP-centric ETF products. These include Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, ProShares, Grayscale, CoinShares, Volatility Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Both ProShares and Volatility Shares have also proposed multiple variants—including short and leveraged ETFs—indicating a concerted push to provide a broad spectrum of trading strategies for investors. Central to Geraci’s prediction is the resolution of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The asset’s regulatory status has been under scrutiny, and many market observers believe that a definitive outcome would pave the way for major financial institutions—like BlackRock—to feel comfortable launching any new crypto-focused investment vehicles. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Print This week, BlackRock, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, signed an agreement with CK Hutchison Holdings to acquire 90% of Panama Ports Company, which operates the crucial Balboa and Cristobal ports. The acquisition comes amid U.S. concerns that the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison could create a strategic foothold for China in the Panama Canal. The deal also addresses some of the U.S.’s strategic anxieties for now, yet the implications extend beyond the Canal’s waters. The agreement holds critical weight in the broader context of U.S.-China competition across the Americas. Click here for the full story in Mandarin

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) – China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) reposted a commentary criticizing CK Hutchison‘s port deal with U.S. firm BlackRock as a betrayal of China, sending shares of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate sharply lower on Friday. The repost of the critical state media commentary by China’s governing body overseeing the territory highlights the complex geopolitical pressures the firm faces, as investors worry the deal could be derailed without Beijing’s backing. CK Hutchison said last week it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the waterway to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. On Thursday, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper based in Hong Kong published a commentary saying the deal “betrays and sells out the whole of Chinese people,” neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. The commentary, reposted on HKMAO’s website, said the U.S. would constrain China’s maritime trade and Chinese companies would face great risks in logistics and supply chains, impacting China’s Belt and Road initiatives. “This deal is an act of hegemony by the U.S., which uses its state power to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through despicable means such as coercion, pressure, and inducement,” the commentary wrote. “It is power politics packaged as a ‘business behavior’.” CK Hutchison and the HKMAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of CK Hutchison closed down 6.4%, underperforming a rise of 2.1% in the benchmark Heng Sang Index .HSI. A Hong Kong-founded and -listed firm owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison has said its business operations are independent from China. Hong Kong’s edge as an international financial center is expected to erode further as it gets squeezed by geopolitical tensions, executives and analysts said. Some shipping companies are moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry, Reuters reported. Trump, meanwhile, is planning an executive order to charge fees for China-linked vessels at U.S. ports, in a bid to resuscitate American shipbuilding and disrupt China’s supply chains. Vera Yuen, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong’s business school, said the commentary was a “manifestation of political risks and a cautionary lesson for companies that want to do business with both sides. “You cannot do both at the same time,” she said. This is not the first time billionaire Li has been in Beijing’s crosshairs. In 2015, Chinese media commentaries criticized him for abandoning China by extensively selling his assets at a time of economic tension in the country. While CK Hutchison agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement, the deal has not been finalized yet. “The risk of the deal has increased,” said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities. “CKH is now caught in the middle; if it doesn’t sell, it would continue to be bothered by the U.S.; but if it sells it would upset Beijing.” “We need to watch where this will lead CKH to now; if it would go through litigation to keep the Panama port, or they will need to communicate with Beijing.” (Reporting by Clare Jim and James Pomfret; Editing by Stephen Coates and Clarence Fernandez) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Stocks rebounded — after entering a correction yesterday — as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opted not to block a funding bill last night. That made it likely that the U.S. government won’t shut down this Saturday. Markets dipped briefly after consumer confidence weakened by ore than expected. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.7% as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing about 360 points, or 0.9%. The Magnificent 7 stocks all rose in trading. Palantir (PLTR+8.76%) and Dell (DELL+3.92%) also advanced. The preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading for March fell to 57.9, lower than both the consensus estimate of 64.0 and the final February level of 64.7. Stocks in focus today: CK Hutchison’s (CKHUY-5.48%) ADRs fell 5.7%, following its Hong Kong-listed shares lower. China used state-controlled media to signal its displeasure with the conglomerate’s planned sale of its ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led (BLK+2.77%) consortium, the WSJ reported. Beijing has refrained from official comment on the transaction. Docusign (DOCU+14.11%) shares jumped 14% after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, even as its projections for future results fell short. Analysts pointed to signs of growth, Barron’s reported. Li Auto’s (LI-4.49%) ADRs climbed even after the Chinese maker of electric vehicles said its revenue will probably fall this quarter. Nvidia (NVDA+4.51%) shares jumped 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF+6.19%) said it’s seen no slowdown in demand for servers it assembles for Nvidia and expects AI-related demand to double this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The company, also called Foxconn, expects total revenue to grow this year. Ulta (ULTA+13.32%) stock gained 7.7% after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results — and despite its projection for the current period falling short of analysts’ projections.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices are struggling to regain momentum after a steep sell-off over the last month (not helped by a serious BlackRock chief executive warning). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has bounced around $80,000 per bitcoin after falling in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s executive order that called for the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve but fell short of market expectations and put bitcoin on the verge of a major price crash. Now, as China quietly primes the bitcoin price for a huge earthquake, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump’s top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve, with a White ... [+] House leak revealing he could be planning to buy huge swathes of bitcoin—something that would likely send the bitcoin price sharply higher. Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential working group on digital assets, told attendees of a closed-door round table hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute that the White House plans to buy as much bitcoin as it can, crypto news outlet Decrypt reported, citing multiple anonymous sources. A White House official confirmed Hines’ comments to Decrypt, adding any such acquisitions would be made "in a budget neutral way that doesn’t cost the taxpayers a dime." The private meeting was reportedly attended by U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) as well as Strategy founder Michael Saylor, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital chief executive Fred Thiel, Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley, and the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc David Bailey. Lummis this week reintroduced legislation that would see the U.S. buy up to one million bitcoin over five years, enshrining into law the strategic bitcoin reserve created by Trump via executive order earlier this month. Trump’s executive order creating the bitcoin reserve was met with a bitcoin price sell-off due to its lack of commitment to buying additional bitcoin. This U.S. currently holds around 200,000 bitcoin, accumulated via civil and criminal forfeitures. However, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and its broader crypto stockpile of other digital assets. “Disappointment over the U.S. government’s strategic bitcoin reserve, formed from seized assets rather than immediate additional purchases, has also weighed on sentiment,” Tagus Capital analysts wrote in an emailed note. “However, concerns over the strategic bitcoin reserve may be overdone, with the potential for budget-neutral future purchases by the U.S. government and an acceleration of other nations adopting bitcoin as strategic reserves.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back from its all-time high, reached in the aftermath of Donald Trump's ... [+] November election victory. Despite the bitcoin price plummeting in recent weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers have been talking up recent developments in the U.S. and abroad, predicting the dip is temporary. “Despite considerable market headwinds, the crypto industry has witnessed several groundbreaking developments, namely: the establishment of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve; the establishment of a U.S. digital asset stockpile; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s authorization for banks to engage in crypto assets; the recognition of stablecoins and real-world assets; and here in Europe the introduction of the E.U.’s MiCA regulations,” Brett Reeves, head of European sales at crypto infrastructure provider BitGo, said in emailed comments. "These advancements, which seemed aspirational merely a year ago, reflect a rapidly evolving landscape where digital assets are becoming integral to the global financial system. So whilst prices may be crashing for now, we must remember how far we've come in a short space in time and just how much potential this space has in the years ahead."

Editor Activism Activist Post, Neenah Payne From 2020-2023, the US government and corporate media told Americans to “Follow the science”. They assured us that the unprecedented COVID policies were based on a “scientific consensus”. Anyone – even top doctors and scientists — who questioned those policies was ridiculed as a “conspiracy theorist” and “anti-vaxxer”. However, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya Confirmed As NIH Director shows how destructive and unscientific those rushed policies were. Yet, the government and corporate media continue to ignore the devastating consequences – the astronomical deaths and injuries – caused by those policies. Now, the documentary Follow The Silenced tells the story of those injured by the COVID shots. Experience Follow the Silenced, a groundbreaking documentary that goes beyond personal stories to expose the deeper systemic challenges faced by the injured.

Anyone who refused to get the shots was ridiculed as a “selfish anti-vaxxer” who was “killing grandma”. Rachel Maddow said people who got the shots could not pass COVID to anyone else. However, the tide has turned now. Viewers demand apology from MSNBC, Rachel Maddow for previous COVID vaccine comments. Why War On Unvaccinated Is So Dangerous For Everyone Don Lemon ridiculed people who didn’t get the shots. Don Lemon argues it’s time to ‘shun’ anti-vaxxersCNN’s Don Lemon On The Unvaccinated: ‘Their Behavior Is Idiotic And Nonsensical’ King of Clowns Don Lemon says unvaxxed people should be banned from going to buy food “CNN talking head Don Lemon says we “shouldn’t waste our breath” on unvaccinated people, so instead of talking to them as rational human beings with dignity and personal freedom, we should ban anyone who hasn’t gotten the ‘Rona vaccine from the grocery store (and employment). I’m sure a lot of people are not gonna agree with this, but [you] don’t get the vaccine, you can’t go to the supermarket. You don’t have the vaccine? You can’t go to the ball game. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t go to work. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service.” Ah, yes. An emergency authorized vaccine for a virus that is insanely survivable for healthy people is the exact same as the moral argument against walking in butt naked to a store. It’s also okay that half of America starves based on this premise.” If Lemon’s comments had been said about ANY other group, they would be banned as hate speech and incitement to violence. CNN’s Don Lemon has lowest-rated week since struggling program switched names shows that Lemon is struggling to maintain an audience. So, these comments may have been an attempt to get publicity. Government and Corporate Media Continue To Ignore Evidence The government and corporate media have continued to ignore and deny the evidence that the COVID shots caused massive deaths and serious injuries. LONG COVID OR VACCINE INJURY? SPIKE PROTEIN FOUND IN THE VACCINATED 2 YEARS LATERWith the NIH showing little concern to study long COVID despite pouring $1 billion into research, a new bombshell study on patients with a debilitating post-vaccination syndrome is showing elevated spike protein levels over 2 years (the time of study) after vaccination. FOLLOW THE SILENCED: EXPOSING THE COVER-UP OF COVID-19 VACCINE INJURIES COVID Shots Are Killing Large Numbers of People World Renowned Conventional Doc Blasts The COVID JAB-Erwocks links to an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, Vice Chief of Internal Medicine, Baylor University Medical Center. The article says Dr. McCullough “might be the world’s top cardiologist, who also holds an MPH degree and is a professor of medicine. His work/background is totally stunning, and seems impossible for one person. …Even better, he’s also world famous. Meaning…he has the exceptional intelligence to analyze and dissect the COVID VAX atrocity. The measured way in which he delivers this bombshell is also remarkable.” Dr. McCullough discusses the blood clots for which the J&J product was halted and points out that the blood clots caused by the mRNA vaccine are “probably 30 times that” — but it has not been halted. Dr. McCullough says “…keep in mind that the NIH is a co-owner of the Moderna patent.” Excess Mortality Just Got Worse: Alarming New Data! Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that when former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd discussed shocking information about excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history,” Dowd stated. Dowd noted an acceleration of excess mortality in 2021, around the time when mandates and boosters took effect. Dowd said “starting in the summer and into the Fall, with the mandates and the boosters, there were 61,000 excess millennial deaths. Basically, millennials experienced a Vietnam War in the second half of 2021.” National Archives stated 58,220 U.S. military fatal casualties of the Vietnam War. Dowd says this data is the smoking gun which shows COVID-19 injections are causing excess mortality in all age groups. Dowd labeled this ‘democide.’ Wikipedia’s definition of democide: “Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder”. Dowd summarized: “So the government, through the mandates, has killed people.” TFH #603: 9/11 And The Deagel Report With Charlie Robinson reported that Dr. Bill Deagle predicted in 2017 that the populations in Western countries would drop by 2025 because of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Robinson correlated those predictions with the “excess deaths” in 2021-2022 in Western countries that took the COVID shots. He pointed out that countries that did not get many COVID shots are ones for which Deagle predicted population rises. So, Dr. Deagle knew by 2017 there was a plan to release a deadly “pandemic” to kill much of the Western population by 2025. Charlie Robinson, host of MagroAggressions explains in the video below that the deaths predicted years ago by Dr. Bill Deagle correspond to the deaths of countries that got the most COVID shots. Robinson is the author of Hypocrazy: Surviving In A World Of Cultural Double Standards (2021) and The Octopus of Global Control in 2017. He is co-author of The Controlled Demolition of the American Empire.Part 1: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie RobinsonA scary look at what the future may hold as the jabbed continue to die.Part 2: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie Robinson First published on 5/13/22 The COVID shots were not necessary. The CDC stats showed in early 2020 that COVID was little threat toa anyone unless they were old and/or had several serious illnesses. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (1984-20220 published an article on 3/26/20 in the New England Journal of Medicine called Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted. It was co-authored by Dr. H. Clifford Lane, M.D., NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects and by Dr. Robert Redfield of the CDC. The article said “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1)…rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively”. However, when Dr. Fauci served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, he endorsed COVID shots for pregnant women and babies as young as six months old. Yet, several inexpensive outpatient treatments for COVID were known in early 2020 — including HCQ, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Ivermectin, and Budesonide. The Emergency Use Authorizations for the COVID shots illegal because EUAs can be issued only if no treatments are available. Dr. Fauci declared “I represent science”. So, anyone who questioned the COVID “consensus” was questioning “science”. Fauci under fire: Declares “I represent science” 11/20/21 With his Sunday retort “What happened on January 6th, Senator?” it appears to critics that Dr. Anthony Fauci has openly expressed what many of them suspected – that he is a partisan political player. Fauci’s comment was made in response to Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s tweet that Fauci should face prosecution for denying under oath that the U.S. helped fund gain of function research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. However, during the Congressional hearing on 6/4/22, Dr. Fauci admitted there was no scientific basis for many COVID policies – including wearing masks and social distancing which was used to justify the devastating lockdowns. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Hearing Reveals Dr. Fauci Made Mitigation Decisions Without Factual Evidence Fauci says no evidence for pandemic guidance on masking or social distancing. The New York Times Magazine: Dr. Fauci Looks Back” ‘Something Clearly Went Wrong’ shows that Fauci admits there were serious problems with the COVID policies he forced on the nation. President Joe Biden pardoned Fauci. President Biden pre-emptively pardoned Fauci back to 2014 when he reportedly authorized illegal gain of function research. However, that may not protect him as state Attorney Generals are now planning to sue Dr. Fauci. The fact that he has been pardoned means that he can no longer invoke The Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer. Attorney General Alan Wilson leads coalition of AGs investigating Dr. Anthony Fauci’s COVID-19 response South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson is leading a coalition of state attorneys general in an investigation into Dr. Anthony Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, demanding accountability for alleged mismanagement, misleading statements, and suppression of scientific debate.

Title: Here Is When Wall Street Giant BlackRock Will Join Spot XRP ETF Race, According To Pundit

Under the new Donald Trump administration, crypto-friendly policies have fueled a surge in ETF filings beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Earlier this week, Franklin Templeton became the largest asset manager to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the price of XRP, the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. Despite multiple issuers filing with the SEC to launch spot XRP funds, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and Bitcoin and Ether ETF issuer, has avoided the Ripple-promoted token. Notably, BlackRock’s spot BTC and ETH ETFs have both experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust ETF, IBIT, eventually matured enough to surpass its gold ETF in assets under management. ETF Store president Nate Geraci believes the asset management behemoth will only file for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) once the SEC’s four-year-long lawsuit against Ripple is concluded. The prolonged battle since December 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be over soon. The July 2023 ruling by District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, declaring XRP a non-security when sold to retail investors, but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional sales marked a turning point. Recent reports indicate the legal spat between the two parties could soon reach a conclusion, with Ripple negotiating better terms as the regulator adopts a more lenient regulatory stance under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. One final issue reportedly being discussed is a comparison between XRP and Ether. At the core is whether XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more of a commodity than a security. Geraci has also predicted that BlackRock’s Solana ETF could be filed with the SEC any day from now. He doesn’t think the $10 trillion asset manager will simply allow rivals to introduce ETFs baked on the XRP and SOL “without any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has previously penciled in a 65% and 70% chance that XRP ETFs and SOL ETFs, respectively, secure a green light this year. However, he did not forecast the timing. Issuers must still contend with regulatory review, lawsuits, and public comment on the pending applications.

Title: BlackRock, other investors to pump another $15 million into debt-ridden Razor Group

Investors including BlackRock Inc. have agreed to provide another loan of at least $15 million to Razor Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as the German e-commerce brand aggregator attempts to stave off a liquidity crunch. The relatively modest financing proposal indicates the severity of the cash squeeze at the Berlin-based firm that, according to Pitchbook data, has raised more than $1.3 billion in capital. It’s part of a turnaround effort that includes talks between Razor and fellow aggregator Infinite Commerce Inc. for a potential merger, the people said, asking not to identified because the process is confidential. A total of $30 million in bridge financing has been granted to Razor over recent months by lenders such as Victory Park Capital Advisors as well as equity investors including Christian Angermayer’s Presight Capital, the people added. The company is also working on a potential fundraising with existing shareholders, according to emails sent to investors in late February and seen by Bloomberg News. Communications show that Razor investors were contemplating a financing of at least $75 million alongside the M&A deal. Spokespeople for Razor, BlackRock and Presight Capital declined to comment on the proposed turnaround. Spokespeople for Victory Park and Infinite Commerce didn’t respond to requests for comment. So-called Amazon aggregators buy up firms that sell products via online platforms, with the aim of saving costs on logistics and marketing by bundling brands under one roof. The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic encouraged investors to bet billions on these businesses, but falling consumer demand since the end of lockdown has seen a wave of restructuring across the sector — to the detriment of their investors. One of their main strategies for plugging holes in these aggregators’ balance sheets has been masterminding consolidation between the e-commerce conglomerates themselves. Infinite Commerce, the potential merger partner, is itself a combination of four brand aggregators that were merged with the help of Victory Park last year. Razor Group also acquired Perch — another BlackRock investment in the aggregator sector — last year. BlackRock and Victory Park joined Razor’s roster of lenders in May 2021, according to a statement at the time. However, the investment has since soured with a BlackRock middle-market private credit fund downgraded to junk last week, in part due to “credit challenges” stemming from brand aggregators. That included a $50.3 million unrealized loss on Razor as of Dec. 31. The publicly traded fund, BlackRock TCP Capital Corp., will “avoid meaningful concentrations in any one industry subsector, such as Amazon aggregators,” Chief Executive Officer Phil Tseng said on a Feb. 27 earnings call. The industry consolidation is fraught with tension between equity holders — who don’t want to take complete losses on their investments — and creditors, who are usually first to be paid in a liquidation but know they’ll only get pennies on the dollar. The hope is that with further acquisitions, Razor can aim for an initial public offering and offer something in return for all investors. Razor ran into issues with inventory, according to the emails from late last month. A delay in closing the purchase of Perch as well as liquidity constraints led to a pause in new orders, leading to periods when products were out of stock. Supply-chain issues also contributed to difficulties replenishing stock later, the messages show. This pressure on earnings eventually led Razor to breach the debt terms of a working capital facility, which then prompted Razor’s other lenders to allege a default on their own financing, according to the emails. This paved the way for discussions over a consensual solution, they show. BlackRock also was involved in the restructuring of SellerX, another German brand aggregator, and agreed to take a stake in the company as part of a debt-for-equity swap, Bloomberg previously reported. Another of its brand aggregator investments, Thrasio, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year.

Title: Panama Canal: China blasts ‘spineless’ sale of ports to BlackRock

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has sharply criticized a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to American asset management giant BlackRock, attacking the deal as “spineless groveling” and a “betrayal” of the Chinese people. A commentary published by the state-owned Ta Kung Pao newspaper and reposted on the website of China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office on Thursday sent shares in CK Hutchison (CKH), the Hong Kong-based owner of the ports, plummeting by more than 6% on Friday. Observers say it was a sign that some investors are concerned the deal may not ultimately go through, if Beijing objects. “I’m not aware that any approval from Chinese regulators is required given CKH is retaining all of its existing Chinese ports,” Dan Baker, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told CNN. “Of course, there is some chance that other influences may be brought to bear on the company that might put the deal at risk. The market seems to be pricing in some chance of this.” CNN has reached out to the conglomerate for comment. Last week, a group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from CK Hutchison. The consortium also agreed to buy CK Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. They said the deal is an “agreement in principle.” US President Donald Trump said during the lead-up to his inauguration and since taking office that he intended to “take back” the Panama Canal from Panama, which took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. He cited Chinese ownership of some of the port operations as a sign that China was now running the canal. When announced last week, the deal was seen as an expedient way for CK Hutchison — a global conglomerate backed by Li Ka-shing, long famed for being one of Hong Kong’s savviest investors — to get rid of a political hot potato while fetching a good price from BlackRock and company. The group said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it expected to receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale, an amount well above what analysts estimated the ports were worth. But Thursday’s scathing commentary from a newspaper closely aligned with the ruling Communist Party could throw a spanner in the works. It called out CK Hutchison, accusing it of “spineless groveling,” “profit-seeking” and “disregarding national interests and national justice, and betraying and selling out all Chinese people.” “Faced with such a major event and a matter of great justice, the relevant company should think twice … and think carefully about what position and side it should stand on,” it added. The Panama Canal was constructed by the US in the early years of the 20th century and completed in 1914. For most of that century, it was operated by the US, before the Carter Administration negotiated its handover to Panama in a controversial treaty opposed by many Republicans at the time. The 51-mile canal is key to both the movement of international trade and US military vessels. About 4% of the world’s maritime trade and more than 40% of US container traffic traverses the canal. Since its handover in 1999, the canal itself has been operated by Panama, not the Chinese, despite Trump’s stated concerns. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Why CEOs are calm about tariffs in public — but 'very discouraged' in private

By Maria Aspan President Trump arrives at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting on March 11, to address a group of CEOs amid an ongoing market selloff sparked by his new tariffs. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption Wall Street is panic-selling over President Trump's chaotic new tariffs. Business executives are reportedly making frantic calls to the White House. And on Tuesday, the country's top CEOs crowded into a closed-door meeting with Trump — setting a record for attendance. Yet in public, corporate America's leaders are remaining calm — and even upbeat. "The business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs," Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told Fox Business Network on Wednesday. Solomon acknowledged that companies "always" want lower tariffs. But he was also careful to start his comments by praising Trump for being "engaged with the business community" — unlike, he added, the Biden administration. The Goldman Sachs CEO was speaking a day after Trump met with him and other members of the Business Roundtable, an influential CEO group. The meeting followed two days of sharp losses in the U.S. stock market, in a $4 trillion (and ongoing) selloff, largely kindled by Trump's words and actions: Since early March, Trump has implemented a flurry of steep new tariffs, reversed some of them, and shrugged off concerns over their economic impact. When asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump demurred — in a reply that sparked this week's market turmoil. "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America," the president told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday. By mid-week, a handful of the most powerful CEOs had started to express concern — but even then, only in very mild terms. "Uncertainty is not a good thing," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank, said Wednesday at a conference hosted by the publication Semafor. And Larry Fink, who runs investment giant BlackRock, told CNN that "the economy is weakening as we speak." Yet Fink was also quick to add that the Trump administration's policies "can be very productive for the United States" in the long run. A White House spokesperson on Thursday reiterated his statement to NPR from earlier this week. "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," White House spokesperson Kush Desai said by email. Corporate America's careful rhetoric — even as many big companies brace for the impact of the market volatility and the tariffs — illustrates the delicate diplomacy that business leaders are trying to engage in. They largely welcome Trump's other economic promises — including lower taxes and fewer regulations. Business leaders also see limited benefits to criticizing the president in public, experts say. That's a marked contrast from Trump's first term, when some CEOs publicly resigned from White House advisory councils to protest the president's handling of racist violence in Charlottesville, Va. But eight years later, corporate America is much less willing to wade into public conversations about politics — or "social" issues that companies don't see as directly related to their bottom lines. Today, they're more focused on the potential financial upsides of Trump's new term. The president actively courted business interests during his campaign — and at first, corporate America seemed thrilled with the results of the election. CEO confidence soared to a three-year high last month, according to the Conference Board's quarterly survey of the CEOs of the largest companies. Now Trump's stop-and-start tariff policies seem to be complicating many companies' economic outlook. But business leaders are trying to avoid adding to investors' financial panic, according to Anna Tavis, who chairs New York University's department of human-capital management and talks to executives across corporate America. She points out that part of a CEO's job is to project confidence — in their own companies, in the markets and in the broader economy. "They have no control over what the government is going to do, regardless of how they feel," says Tavis. And, she adds: "Obviously, they want to be on the winning side of whatever happens." Behind the scenes, the conversation is more candid. CEOs "are very discouraged," says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who hosted a gathering of CEOs on Tuesday. 80% of those CEOs say "that they find themselves apologizing to our international partners for Trump's capriciousness," Sonnenfeld told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. And, he added, "roughly 70% said the Trump administration is going to be bad for the economy." Those numbers are a sharp contrast to the Conference Board's rosier findings last month. It regularly polls the heads of the largest U.S. companies, and it finished its latest survey on February 10 — after Trump had first announced, then first delayed, his new 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada. "I know people were surprised that we saw this increase in CEO confidence at the time that tariffs may [start to] have a negative impact on the economy," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, told NPR last week. Many of the CEOs surveyed in late January and early February did tell the Conference Board that they're worried about tariffs, she added. But at the time, business leaders said they were more focused on Trump's other, business-friendlier promises, including deregulation and lower taxes. Still, Guichard is curious to see what CEOs tell the Conference Board in two months, when it next polls America's business leaders. "A lot can happen between now and May," she says.

Title: President Trump’s State of the Union Address – What Was Said and Not Said
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/president-trump-state-union-address/5881574
Time Published: 2025-03-14T08:09:00Z
Full Content:
On 4 March 2025, President Trump presented his first State of the Union address. Since it is his first one in his second term, they call it his address to the Joint Session of Congress. It sounded like the MAGA Trump, the best-ever in the history of the United State, America First, repeated numerous times, naturally. The speech was generally smooth, well presented, and a bit long, but not boring. . . . The President started telling the audience how he won, how HIGH he won, that he got every single swing state – and a majority of millions of popular votes, not to mention the large margin of electoral votes. So, just to remind people that the Dems have lost badly. He boasted about having signed more than hundred Executive Orders, many of which are being implemented as “we speak.”Many had to do with protecting the United States, putting America First; Making America Great Again – the famous MAGA. He highlighted the southern border protection and blamed the previous Administration for welcoming 21 million illegal refugees during the last four years, putting them up in first class hotels with debit cards – so they feel at home. He added, most of them are criminals, right out of prisons… And we will deport them back. The returning them to their countries has already started. President Trump was accompanied, as is usual, by his wife and family, of course, and by his newly approved Cabinet, and many special civilian and military invitees. Depending from what angle you were watching, to the left were the Democrats, to the right the Republicans. Symbolically speaking the Donkeys and the Elephants. What was oddly striking was the hardline division between the two parties; one could sense the hatred of the Dems. That speaks about the American Democracy. They lost the election because more people voted for Trump than for their candidate, Kamala Harris, but they cannot accept it. Is it because they have not finished yet implementing their Globalist Agenda 2030? Their behavior was – sorry to say – worse than childish. Many Dems Congresswomen wore pink in defiance against the President. That’s what the leader of the Dems Women’s Caucus Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico told Time Magazine. She added, the color expresses, “Our protest of Trump’s policies which are negatively impacting women and families. Pink is a color of power and protest. It’s time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear.” And, “We want the world to know we stand in protest, we stand in power. We stand in pink and we stand in opposition.” Yes, but what is so bad about Trump’s policies affecting American families? That he is against wokeism, against the trans-sexual hype, against children’s mutilation for sex change, declaring that in the United States there are just two genders, male and female, the ones we were born with? That trans-males are no longer permitted to compete with women in sports, and that they will be kept out of women’s bathrooms and locker rooms? See this. Aren’t these pro-women rules meant to protect women? While the President got many standing ovations from the Republican side of the aisle, the Dems side acted like in a bonded-agreement, they would never rise, NEVER, applaud, not one single time, even though there were many subjects that had to do would the nation, they were beyond party lines, positive statements, or proposals, touching both sides. But, they put up in silence their little, difficult-to-read, protest signs. A deception for those who still had some hopes for the Democratic party. It has turned neoliberal, dumb and undemocratic. Seeing this from a distance, it appeared outright childish. After all, Donald Trump is the President of the entire country. Smiling on several occasions to the left side of the aisle, he said so and reiterated, he was elected to unify a broken country, and that was his intention. Why not give him the benefit of the doubt, rather than start with a conflict? Highlights of his speech – some were controversial, others were positive steps into the right direction. On the positive side, Trump said that in the meantime, just shortly before his address to the Joint Session of Congress, the otherwise called “State of the Union” speech, he had received a letter from Zelensky, basically an apology for his behavior in the Oval Office, saying that he was ready for Peace and wanted “strong” President Trump as broker for Peace between Russia and Ukraine. That came after Zelensky had met with British PM Keir Starmer and other European leaders, like Macron, in London just after the White House meeting. It sounds like the Europeans may have suggested the apology, as they want to keep the US in “their game.” While it was kind of good news, who knows what will emerge from the renewed Trump-Zelensky deal negotiation. Will the rare earths concession come up again? Controversial, The unspoken fact about taking the canal back, is that the Chinese holding company in Hong Kong just sold the Chinese port ownership to the US financial giant BlackRock – which puts the canal back in US “custody”, so to speak. Neutral, Tariffs are tricky matters. Even though they are reciprocal they do not affect every country and economy the same way. Washington levying high import tariffs on certain products, may backfire against its own economy, for example, by heating up inflation at home. Not mentioned were, This address to the Joint Session of Congress may go down in history as one of the boldest, spelling out unhidden controversies, and making the world understand that Trump wants to be portrayed as a “a no nonsense” President – pushing through on the world stage what he finds is necessary to put America First again and to Make America Great Again, the MAGA President day-in, day-out, as long as he gets away with it. President Trump intends to give new meaning to the “rules-based order.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Another company is caught in the US-China fight, and investors are worried
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/panama-canal-blackrock-ck-hutchinson-deal-company-us-china-fight-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-14T07:30:49Z

China has taken aim at another company it's not happy with, sending its share price sliding. On Thursday, China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted a commentary from state-owned Ta Kung Pao — a Hong Kong media outlet — that criticized Hong Kong's CK Hutchinson for its decision to sell a major stake in two Panama ports to a consortium led by New York-based BlackRock. CK Hutchison's shares fell as much as 6.7% on Friday morning — the most since September 2022 — and were 6.2% lower at 2:58 p.m. local time. Its market value is about $23 billion. The $22.8 billion deal was announced last week after US President Donald Trump hit out at Chinese influence at the Panama Canal and threatened to regain control over the key shipping waterway. The news came after another multinational company was caught in the ongoing US-China dispute. On Thursday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it had communicated with Walmart over reports that the retail giant had asked suppliers to cut wholesale prices to offset higher US tariffs. A social media account linked to state TV first reported the news and warned that Walmart would face repercussions if the company insisted on squeezing suppliers. Ta Kung Pao said the Panama deal demonstrates that the US is using "state power" to encroach on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and that it's "power politics packaged as 'business behavior.'" It also criticized CK Hutchinson for being "spineless" and "profit-seeking." The deal disregards national interests and "betrays and sells out all Chinese people," according to the commentary. It advised companies to "think carefully about what position and side they should stand on." The company did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment. Founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing — once Asia's richest man, CK Hutchinson said last week its decision was "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports." The development demonstrates how private companies and their business dealings are increasingly getting caught in the crosshairs of intensified US-China geopolitical tensions. Ta Kung Pao said in its commentary that the US would use the port deal for "political purposes and promote its own political agenda." "China's shipping and trade here will inevitably be subject to the US," it added. Despite investor concerns over the deal following Tung Ka Pao's commentary, analysts see the deal as positive for CK Hutchinson. "It's an astute deal selling to a buyer, ostensibly backed by the Trump administration, at the top of the market, knowing global trade could fall under a new tariff regime," wrote David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, on Thursday. He added that he doesn't expect the company to reverse its decision to sell the ports following the commentary. Analysts at CreditSights wrote last week that not only is CK Hutchinson selling its assets at an attractive price, it's also removing geopolitical risks associated with its Panama ports. Jump to

Title: Several states seek end to property taxes: Shouldn't have to 'rent from the government'

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/13/2025 11:02:03 PM PDT by Libloather As Tax Day nears, fiscally conservative leaders in several states are pushing to abolish property taxes, with one Pennsylvania lawmaker arguing that homeowners shouldn’t have to "pay rent" to the government. That lawmaker, state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday ahead of his latest effort to end the collection of such taxes in the Keystone State. Diamond will put forward a resolution — titled HB 900 — which Fox News Digital learned exclusively will be filed imminently. The document is a draft constitutional amendment he hopes will go to the voters on Election Day, and not a typical piece of legislation requiring gubernatorial approval. Pennsylvania Republicans previously utilized the constitutional amendment process to accelerate the rollback of COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by then-Gov. Tom Wolf and then-health secretary Rachel Levine — by placing the amendment directly before voters on Election Day. "Property taxes are an issue that is not exactly partisan, because in some areas, it’s more of a big deal than in others," Diamond said, citing varying relationships between taxes and school district funding. Lebanon, he said, is kind of "middle-of-the-road," but that just to the east in Allentown and Mount Pocono, property taxes are a "big deal." "For me, the ‘big deal’ is that I want people to own their homes and not have to rent from the government, all across Pennsylvania," he said. In a recent post on his Substack, Diamond quipped that every time the topic comes up, "folks get all twisted into knots over how we’re going to pay for the things those taxes currently pay for — frankly, they’re missing the point." "Boiled down to its very essence, fulfilling the promise of personal liberty is impossible if you can’t actually own a piece of real property," he said. (Excerpt) Read more at foxbusiness.com ...

Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday ahead of his latest effort to end the collection of such taxes in the Keystone State. Diamond will put forward a resolution — titled HB 900 — which Fox News Digital learned exclusively will be filed imminently. The document is a draft constitutional amendment he hopes will go to the voters on Election Day, and not a typical piece of legislation requiring gubernatorial approval. Pennsylvania Republicans previously utilized the constitutional amendment process to accelerate the rollback of COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by then-Gov. Tom Wolf and then-health secretary Rachel Levine — by placing the amendment directly before voters on Election Day. "Property taxes are an issue that is not exactly partisan, because in some areas, it’s more of a big deal than in others," Diamond said, citing varying relationships between taxes and school district funding. Lebanon, he said, is kind of "middle-of-the-road," but that just to the east in Allentown and Mount Pocono, property taxes are a "big deal." "For me, the ‘big deal’ is that I want people to own their homes and not have to rent from the government, all across Pennsylvania," he said. In a recent post on his Substack, Diamond quipped that every time the topic comes up, "folks get all twisted into knots over how we’re going to pay for the things those taxes currently pay for — frankly, they’re missing the point." "Boiled down to its very essence, fulfilling the promise of personal liberty is impossible if you can’t actually own a piece of real property," he said. (Excerpt) Read more at foxbusiness.com ...

Title: Ireland under-20s looking for positive end to campaign against Italy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/14/ireland-under-20s-looking-for-positive-end-to-campaign-against-italy/

Full Content:
Ireland go into the final match of the tournament hoping to avoid another unwanted landmark in this season’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship. Having lost in Musgrave Park for the first time since making it their home, to first England and then France, they travel to Treviso for a potentially tricky fixture. Ireland have played the Italians on 21 occasions in all tournaments at under-20 level, won 19, drawn one (L’Aquila in 2013) and lost just once, a World Cup game in 2017, but have never suffered a defeat to their hosts in a Six Nations game. The two sides go into this game with similar records, having both beaten Scotland, and lost their other three games. The Italians had a chance to beat Wales at home but missed a last-minute penalty in a 20-18 defeat. The two countries met in their traditional pre-Christmas friendly, a game Ireland won. Irish secondrow Billy Corrigan is the only survivor on the visiting team from last year’s Six Nations contest in Cork. Italy have four in centre Federico Zanandrea and secondrow Tomassi Redondi, who started in that game, and prop Sergio Pelliccioli and number eight Giacomo Milano, who came off the bench. Milano captains this year’s team. He said: “Ireland are a technically very well prepared and structured team in terms of set-up; they are halfway between England and France. We must not concede easy chances. We can try to break it down like we did against England, studying them well. We could put them in difficulty and make sure we also have some possession and opportunities to show our game. I’m sure we can do well.” Ireland head coach Neil Doak has gone with largely the same player pool for the entire tournament, rotating players in and out of the starting team, while keeping the matchday 23 broadly similar in personnel. Scrumhalf Chris O’Connor is set to make his debut off the bench. Injuries to key players like props Alex Usanov, Niall Smyth and Emmet Calvey, secondrow Alan Spicer, backrow Luke Murphy and wing Derry Moloney are a significant factor, but with a view to the summer’s World Championship in Italy there appeared scope to have more of a look outside the primary group of players. Doak has every right to pursue whatever selection he feels is best and has decided to double down with his choices. He’s certainly supported this group of players. Rotation sees Clark Logan back at scrumhalf, Henry Walker at hooker and David Walsh get a first start in the backrow. O’Connor comes into the squad, while Mikey Yarr and Bobby Power go from the starting team to the bench. Reshuffling shifts Ciarán Mangan from left wing to centre with Gene O’Leary Kareem heading in the opposite direction, while Walsh’s promotion to the starting team means that Michael Foy swaps the six for the seven jersey. Foy’s performance against France the last day would sit comfortably alongside the best individual displays at this age-grade over the past few years. The Munster academy prospect, who counts Carrigaline RFC, CBC Cork, UCC and Cork Con as part of his rugby journey, will hopefully bring to bear his considerable talent in shaping a positive outcome in Treviso. Ireland will need to be clinical and disciplined, traits lacking in previous outings, to get that result.

Title: The 100 best Irish books of the 21st century: No 50 to No 26

“Says who?” is often my reaction when presented with any “Best of ...” list in the media. Mindful of this and the knowledge that any verdict is only as trustworthy as the calibre of the jurors, I invited more than 60 experts (authors, critics, academics, booksellers and festival curators – their names are listed at the bottom) to submit an unranked list of their 50 favourite Irish novels or short story collections of the century so far, either titles they loved or ones they felt were too significant to overlook. My colleague, data analyst Cathal Stack, collated the results into a list of the 100 most broadly popular titles, ranked in descending order based on the number of nominations each received. I then asked the panel to fine-tune the list by reordering the titles from 1 to 100, to reflect their own personal preferences and thus to establish which books had inspired the deepest love. On Thursday, we published numbers 100 to 51 and on Saturday we will reveal the top 25 Irish fiction titles of the century so far. Below are the books ranked 50 to 26. Another brilliant Stinging Fly debut short story collection. The Cork author has won the Windham-Campbell Prize and Sunday Times Short Story Award. Read our review here Nell sets out into the world but finds her history hard to escape. Her leaving causes a lifetime’s turmoil to churn in her mother, Carmel. Over both looms Carmel’s famous father, a gifted but selfish poet. Read our review here A harrowing exploration of a brutal gang rape of a young woman and its aftermath in a small Irish community, it fearlessly, relentlessly tackles the complex topic of sexual consent. Originally published as a young adult novel, it was adapted for an award-winning play. Read our review here An impressive, cerebral debut written with brio and humour, it teems with insights about class, race, language and sexuality. Ava, a young Irish graduate teaching English in Hong Kong, gets involved with Julian, an English banker, and Edith, a local lawyer. Read our review here “Each story in this debut collection is a masterclass in narrative control,” writes Joseph O’Connor. “The pace of the writing is perfect. This is writing that makes Francis Bacon at his bleakest seem like Mary Poppins.” Read our review here Sally Rooney’s fourth novel is her finest, a deeply moving story of two grieving brothers and the women they love, explored with emotional intelligence and a stream-of-consciousness technique to render the boundless complexity of the inner life. Read our review here The second in a trilogy that includes The Woman Who Walked into Doors (1996) and The Women Behind the Door (2024), it is a tender portrait of a recovering alcoholic coming to terms with grown-up children and a rapidly changing Ireland. Read our review here This western is a masterpiece of atmosphere and language. After joining the US army, aged 17, Thomas McNulty and John Cole fight in the Indian wars and the American civil war. Their lives are vivid and filled with wonder, despite the horrors, and enriched but imperilled when a young Indian girl crosses their path. Read our review here Written with verve, humour and heart, this is an epic account of modern Ireland through the life story of Cyril Avery, born out of wedlock and adopted by an eccentric Dublin couple, spanning three countries, two continents and 626 pages. Dedicated to John Irving, it is on a par with some of that US writer’s best works. Read our review here An exquisite, delicate work by a master of historical fiction, based on the real-life love affair of Abbey Theatre actor Molly Allgood and playwright JM Synge and its tragic ending. The Galway writer’s second novel is the tender story of how one boy and his mission transforms the lives of his teachers, Tess and Tadhg, and brings together a community. Written with verve, it’s about love, family, connection and the power of imagination. Read our review here A dynamic debut about the messy, overlapping relationships between four captivating characters, capturing a young, feminist consciousness. Students Frances and Bobbi, best friends and former lovers, each become involved with a married couple, Melissa and Nick, testing their friendship and characters. Read our review here In this debut suffused with gentle wisdom and kindness, Leonard and Hungry Paul, two quiet friends who see the world differently, use humour, board games and silence to steer their way through modern life. Read our review here Remarkably written when the author was almost 90, a story inspired by the brutal kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls by Islamist extremists, Boko Haram. A young woman, barely more than a girl herself, must learn to survive with her child. Read our review here The poet’s prose debut sculpts essay and autofiction to explore inner life and the deep connection felt between two writers centuries apart. In the 1700s, Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, an Irish noblewoman, on discovering her husband has been murdered, drinks handfuls of his blood and composes an extraordinary poem, Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire. In the present day, a young mother narrowly avoids tragedy and becomes obsessed with the poem’s parallels with her own life. Read our review here In Ballina, a dispute over drugs results in a teenage boy being held captive in the home of a recluse, while his girlfriend tries to rescue him. It won the Nero Debut Fiction award, whose judges said: “The wit and humour belie an undercurrent of menace, and yet there is deep empathy and compassion at its heart.” Read our review here This Booker Prize winning dystopian novel explores the rise of political extremism and the plight of refugees. Eilish Stack tries to make sense of a nightmarish social collapse as her union leader husband is detained by secret police, desperate to do whatever it takes to keep her family together. Read our review here Seán is back in post-ceasefire Belfast with a degree from Liverpool University but as a working-class outsider still faces the school of hard knocks. Louise Kennedy called it “Kneecap meets Chekhov”. Winner of the Rooney and Nero Debut Fiction prizes. Read our review here Set in a fictional Mayo town, these stories deftly explore the wayward lives and loves of the local youth. Brilliant and acute at a sentence level. Winner of the Frank O’Connor International Short Story Award, Rooney Prize and Guardian First Book Award. One story, Calm with Horses, was made into a film. Read our review here This compelling debut novel subtly reconfigures and updates the archetypal story of a son’s quarrel with his father. A story of family values and divided loyalties in pre-recession Ireland, it won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and Irish Book of the Year. Read our review here The story of a 57-year-old fugitive, his only comforts a mutilated dog and a love for nature. “A stunning and wonderful achievement by a writer touched by greatness,” writes Joseph O’Connor.

Title: Pentagon considering military options for Panama Canal access: Report

Officials say US military’s Southern Command exploring multiple options, from working with Panama to military action. The Pentagon is reportedly exploring military options for the Panama Canal to ensure ongoing US access to the strategically important waterway, following a request from the White House. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a document, described as an interim national security guidance by the new Trump administration, called on US forces to look at military options to safeguard access to the Panama Canal. Responding to reports of possible US military action, Panama’s government said that it would remain “firm” in defending its sovereignty amid the news that US President Donald Trump is considering options aimed at “reclaiming” the strategic canal. “With respect to these statements, I have nothing more to say than that Panama remains firm in defending its territory, its canal, and its sovereignty,” Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters on Thursday. “Let it be clear, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and will remain so,” he added. Tensions between the US and Panama have again spiralled over Trump’s repeated threats to “take back” the Panama Canal. News of US military planning was reported earlier this week by NBC, citing an internal memo from the Trump administration and remarks from unnamed US officials. Officials told the network that the US military’s Southern Command will consider several options, including working with Panama’s military or taking the canal by force. They also said a US invasion of Panama is still unlikely at this time. The memo, however, asked the Pentagon “to provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal”, according to reports. The Panama Canal runs through the narrow isthmus of Panama connecting North and South America, and is highly valuable because it connects the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. While more than 100 years old, the waterway has been in the global spotlight since Trump took office in January. The US president said in an address to the US Congress last week that his administration “will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it”. Despite his frequent remarks about the canal, Trump has yet to speak publicly about how the canal will be taken and if the US military would be involved. The US acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century. In a treaty signed in 1979, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, the US agreed to turn over control of the canal to Panama at the close of 1999. But the US and Panama are treaty-bound to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality and are permitted to take unilateral action to do so. Control of the canal has also been a point of contention between Washington and Beijing, as Trump has previously claimed – without evidence – that China is secretly controlling the waterway. Both Panama and China have denied any foreign interference. Until recently, two of the canal’s four major ports were majority-owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings. After weeks of scrutiny, the conglomerate last week sold most of its global port operations – spanning 23 countries – to a consortium of investors led by the US firm BlackRock for $22.8bn. While the sale may have appeased Trump for now, the company now appears to be in the crosshairs of China’s Communist Party. This week, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a scathing op-ed calling the BlackRock deal a “betrayal” of the Chinese people and CK Hutchison a “spineless grovelling, profit-seeking, profit-forgetting” company. The newspaper’s commentary was later uploaded to the website of China’s representative offices in Hong Kong and Macau, indicating tacit approval of its contents. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: 'When Do You Keep A Stock? When Do You Sell It, And When Do You Add To It?' Suze Orman Says Don't Sell Out Of Fear

“When do you keep a stock? When do you sell it, and when do you add to it?” That's the question Suze Orman recently posed on her "Women & Money" podcast — and it's one that many investors struggle with, especially during market volatility. Investing in the stock market can be intimidating, and when prices start to drop, it's easy to panic and make emotional decisions. But Orman advises that reacting out of fear is often a mistake. “The main internal obstacle to wealth is fear,” Orman said. “Fear, everybody, just that simple.” She pointed out that fear is pervasive right now, driven by economic uncertainty, rising costs, and geopolitical tensions. Don't Miss: This fear can lead to knee-jerk reactions in the stock market. Orman explained that when investors panic and sell off stock, it can drive prices down further. Orman used Palantir as an example. In the last month, it has dropped from about $125 a share to below $80 a share. “You feel good for a while, cause maybe you sold Palantir at 95, and now here it’s at 85 and you feel like such a winner. Are you kidding me?” she said, adding that short-term gains from selling out of fear can result in missed long-term growth opportunities. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. Orman advises that if a stock has strong fundamentals — good management, a solid product, and future growth potential — you should hold onto it even if the market dips. She reminded listeners about the market downturn in 2022 when major tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia performed poorly. “They were referred to as the Stinky 7 because of how badly they had gone down,” Orman said. But those who stayed invested saw significant returns. Nvidia, for example, rebounded with a 240% gain in 2023. Orman reminded listeners that those who bought stock at much lower prices were still sitting on significant gains. And even if they didn't, if the stock is fundamentally strong, it’s better to stay invested rather than react impulsively to market swings. Trending: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. While holding onto strong stocks can lead to long-term gains, there are times when selling makes sense. Orman advised selling if a stock's value becomes too large a portion of your overall portfolio. This helps to reduce the risk of losing too much if the stock suddenly drops. She explained that selling can also be a smart move if you need the funds for other investments or financial goals. However, Orman warned against selling just because the stock has gone up or down temporarily. Taking profits too soon can lead to missed opportunities if the stock rebounds. Orman supports adding to a stock position when you have the funds to do so strategically — through dollar-cost averaging. This means investing smaller amounts consistently over time, which reduces the risk of buying at a peak. “You have another $300 that you can put into Palantir totally. So all right, put $50 at a time in it so that you have at least six more times that you can buy the stock if it continues to go down,” she advised. See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Orman shared her own strategy with Palantir. She mentioned how she bought more shares when the price dropped from $113 to $98 and again when it hit $85. She said this approach lowers the average cost per share over time and allows for greater potential gains when the stock eventually rises. However, she also cautioned that this strategy works best for those who have the funds to continue buying as the price drops. Orman's advice boils down to staying calm and focused on long-term growth rather than reacting to market fear. Keeping, selling, or adding to a stock should be based on the strength of the company and your overall financial strategy — not panic over market swings. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: China Amplifies Newspaper's Attack on CK Hutchison Over Panama Ports Deal

China’s top office on Hong Kong issues reposted a sharp attack on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. for agreeing to sell a controlling stake in Panama ports, warning companies to be very careful about which “side they should stand on.” The commentary in the Ta Kung Pao newspaper appeared on the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office’s website on Thursday. It said social media users accused the conglomerate founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing of “spineless groveling,” ignoring China’s interests and “selling out all Chinese people.” “Faced with such a major event and a matter of great justice, the relevant companies should think twice, think carefully about the nature and crux of the issue, and think carefully about what position and side they should stand on,” the paper said. CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The move by Beijing’s top authority on Hong Kong to repost the broadside could complicate the decision-making of executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. Last week, CK Hutchison agreed to sell a controlling stake in Panama ports that had become a political lightning rod and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. The potential purchase by BlackRock Inc. was one of the biggest acquisitions of the year, and marked a win for US President Donald Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. The commentary in Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper that tends to support Beijing’s policies, said the US would use the ports deal “for political purposes and promote its own political agenda.” “China’s shipping and trade here will inevitably be subject to the US,” it added. It also said the US was “doing its utmost to contain and suppress China’s development,” repeating a line often used by the Asian nation’s diplomats when they criticize Washington. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Schooner Maroro reappears on Hawke’s Bay beach, 97 years after wrecking on reef

A schooner wrecked on a Hawke’s Bay beach in the 1920s has been revealed from its sandy tomb on Pōrangahau Beach by high swells in recent weeks. Tena McLean of Pōrangahau remembers going out to Blackhead lighthouse with her father around 50 years ago and seeing bits of the Schooner Maroro wreckage sticking up through the sands. “Some years we would go and couldn’t see anything,” McLean said. “[This is] the most exposed I’ve ever seen it.” Lane and Sons built the ship in Whangaroa, Northland in 1904 as a wooden three-masted schooner weighing 230 tonnes, 126 feet in length, 29.4 feet in breadth and with a depth of 7.6 feet. It named it Maroro, which in te reo can mean “to be strong”, “flying fish” or “wasted”, depending on where the macrons are placed. Historian Michael Fowler says Gisborne merchants owned the ship and it regularly travelled to Australia but had quite a troubled life before it wrecked. “One time [in 1922] it took 45 days to get from Newcastle in Australia to Gisborne,” he said. “It lost its rudder and they were quite worried, obviously in those days you didn’t have GPS or communications. “It also narrowly missed having a shipwreck the year before it did, due to bad weather.” About 4am on October 24, 1927, bad luck struck when the schooner was trying to avoid bad weather by taking shelter near Blackrock Reef, 38km north of Cape Turnagain and 72km south of Cape Kidnappers. The ship hit the reef and the waves carried it to shore, leaving it to be beached in the sands of Pōrangahau Beach. Fowler says all the crew got off safely and it was hoped to be salvaged by its owners with help from the schooner Kaiaia. Unfortunately, the weather again played the villain. “Rough weather happened again and because it had been thrown over the reef they found it difficult to get off, then it got a hole in it,” Fowler said. “As you know it’s pretty windy down that coast, it started filling up with sand inside the boat and they eventually abandoned it ... and it was just left there.” A court of inquiry was held at Napier on December 2, 1927, where Captain JW Jones told the court the weather conditions forced him to shelter near Blackhead. The court found that the Maroro was beached through the stress of weather, with no evidence of any fault of the captain or the first officer. Despite no crew perishing in the wreck, a man did die at the scene a few months later. “In March 1928, a 33-year-old man who was a cook fell down a hole in the wreck and hit his head and he died in Waipukurau Hospital,” Fowler said. The Maroro was later sold in its wrecked state to Fred Goodman of Gisborne. “But he probably just took parts out of the ship, as the bones still remain on the beach today,” Fowler said. The remains of the boat are still visible near Blackrock Reef. Fowler said they are likely to soon sink back down into the sands until the next high seas. Jack Riddell is a multimedia journalist with Hawke’s Bay Today and spent the last 15 years working in radio and media in Auckland, London, Berlin, and Napier.

Title: Financial advisers, wirehouses set to fuel next wave of Bitcoin ETF adoption

James Seyffart highlighted that big financial institutions recommending crypto ETFs to high-net-worth clients will boost the adoption of these products. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the next phase of adoption for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be driven by financial advisers, wirehouses, and brokers managing assets for high-net-worth individuals. Speaking on the “Coin Stories” podcast, Seyffart outlined how these financial institutions, which oversee trillions of dollars in assets, could play a central role in expanding the market for Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had an exceptionally strong first year in the market, surpassing many analysts’ expectations. While Bloomberg maintained a bullish outlook on the ETFs, he acknowledged that actual performance exceeded their forecasts. Seyffart said: “There have been some outflows in recent weeks, but they have taken about, in a peak, just $40 billion since their launch, they have 110 billion-ish dollars in assets. IBIT is one of the most traded ETFs on a consistent regular basis, reached $50 billion in a hundred couple days, the previous record was over a thousand days. So, no matter how you slice it, they have broken every record that you can look at.” Given this momentum, he suggested that gradually adopting Bitcoin ETFs as a portfolio allocation tool for high-net-worth clients could drive continued success. Despite big players such as BlackRock recommending a 1% to 2% BTC allocation in investment portfolios, Seyffart highlighted that “big wirehouses and huge banks” are not allowing investors to buy crypto ETFs. He added that wirehouses, financial advisers, and brokerage platforms control significant capital from ultra-wealthy investors, including billionaires. These entities influence asset allocation decisions across a broad spectrum of financial portfolios. Seyffart indicated that if these institutions begin incorporating Bitcoin ETFs as a satellite portion of their portfolios, such as 5%, it could lead to sustained growth in adoption. In addition to institutional adoption, Seyffart noted the trend of corporations, states, and even nations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This could contribute to Bitcoin’s legitimacy and stability as an asset class within traditional finance. However, he emphasized that increased acceptance among financial intermediaries will likely be the key driver of ETF growth.

Title: Tensions over Taiwan; EU corruption probe of Huawei; OpenAI rattled by DeepSeek; CK Hutchison deal with BlackRock slammed for "spineless kowtowing"
URL: https://sinocism.com/p/tensions-over-taiwan-eu-corruption
Time Published: 2025-03-13T22:55:28Z
Full Content:
I will not be surprised if the PRC launches another round of exercises/rehearsals around Taiwan in response to President Lai Ching-te’s comments today. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Taiwan President Lai calls PRC a “foreign hostile force” - On March 13, President Lai Ching-te convened a high-level national security meeting and later outlined 17 key strategies to counter five major threats from China. These threats include challenges to Taiwan’s sovereignty, espionage targeting its military, efforts to obscure national identity, societal infiltration through cross-strait exchanges, and economic inducements to attract Taiwanese businesspeople and youth. President Lai stressed the government’s commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and called for unity among citizens to resist division. He urged the public to strengthen media literacy, engage in civic education, and expose foreign influence. He also labeled China a "foreign hostile force" under the Anti-Infiltration Act, justifying the need for stronger preventive measures. Chen Binhua, Spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, responded by saying in part that Lai Ching-te...once again propagated the separatist fallacy of so-called "mutual non-subordination" across the Taiwan Strait. He recklessly claimed that "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent democratic country", exaggerated the so-called "Mainland threat", defined the Mainland as an "external hostile force," and put forward "17 strategies" under the guise of responding to "five types of threats." Lai Ching-te’s stubborn commitment to "Taiwan independence", coupled with his provocative confrontational stance, once again proves that he is an outright "destroyer of cross-strait peace" and a "creator of crises in the Taiwan Strait.".. His tactics aim to divert attention from internal conflicts and alleviate his governance crisis. This fully exposes his selfishness and his willingness to destabilize Taiwan's society. He ties the people of Taiwan to the chariot of "Taiwan independence", pushing Taiwan towards a perilous situation of war and conflict—which reveals his evil nature. The PRC response has a strong "you have not learned your lesson" tone to it. 2. No serious talks about a Xi-Trump Summit - Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times reports on a request by Senator Steve Daines to have Trump designate him as a “special envoy to China to help secure a meeting with Xi Jinping that could pave the way for a summit between the leaders” that “People familiar with discussions between Washington and Beijing since Trump took office said the two sides had not engaged in serious talks about a possible summit between the two presidents”. So I would not be making plans for a Xi-Trump April meeting. 3. Huawei in middle of European Parliament corruption probe - A massive corruption probe centered around Huawei is underway in the EU. Follow the Money, one of the publications that broke the story, reports that the code name for the investigation is “Operation Generation” and that “Investigators suspect the lobbyists may have committed crimes by bribing lawmakers with items including expensive football tickets, lavish gifts, luxurious trips to China and even cash in exchange for advocating for Huawei in the European Parliament.” 4. BlackRock’s Panama Canal deal may be in trouble - I wrote last week about the BlackRock deal to buy control of ports on either side of the Panama Canal, as well as 43 other ports outside of the PRC and Hong Kong, that it is not clear whether Li or his company gave Beijing a heads up about the transaction, or had to get permission. Now Beijing may be having a say. Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong paper closely tied to the government, published a commentary titled “Don’t Be Naïve, Don’t Be Confused” that blasted the deal: If the Panama Canal becomes "Americanized" and "politicized", the U.S. will undoubtedly use it for political purposes, implementing policies that restrict Chinese trade. If the U.S. imposes selective passage restrictions, political surcharges, or other barriers, China’s logistics costs and supply chain stability could face severe risks. Additionally, by acquiring this massive port network, BlackRock will control approximately 10.4% of the world's container terminal throughput, making it one of the top three global port operators. This gives BlackRock leverage to cooperate with the U.S. in restricting Chinese shipping operations, raising costs for Chinese cargo ships, and squeezing China out of the global maritime trade. Moreover, this deal would create significant gaps in the port network built by Chinese companies over many years, allowing U.S. interests to eat away at China’s overseas economic foothold… many netizens have strongly criticized both this deal and CK Hutchison Holdings, regarding this as spineless kowtowing [腰骨的跪低], solely pursuing profit and forgetting righteousness, disregarding national interests and greater national principles, betraying and selling out all Chinese people. These emotional expressions from internet users are completely understandable. In the face of such a significant geopolitical and economic issue, the companies involved must think carefully. They must understand the true nature of this deal, its underlying implications, and where they stand on this critical matter.

ByteDance pushing hard for Project Texas TikTok deal - The Information reports that Oracle has emerged as the leading contender to help run TikTok as part of a deal orchestrated by President Trump and that ByteDance wants to maintain operational influence over TikTok, even if U.S. companies acquire a stake in TikTok U.S. They are pushing hard on reviving Project Texas, even though it does not comply with current law. Oracle needs the revenue, it is already a big vendor to ByteDance, and according to The Information “ByteDance is one of the largest renters of Nvidia graphics processing units at Oracle, and it is set to receive some of the first Blackwell chips that go to the cloud provider in coming weeks”. 6. OpenAI’s DeepSeek worries - DeepSeek clearly has OpenAI rattled, and the company is using it as a pretext to get support and protection from The US government. OpenAI, in a letter to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy with proposals for the AI Action Plan under consideration writes: As with Huawei, there is significant risk in building on top of DeepSeek models in critical infrastructure and other high-risk use cases given the potential that DeepSeek could be compelled by the CCP to manipulate its models to cause harm. And because DeepSeek is simultaneously state-subsidized, state-controlled, and freely available, the cost to its users is their privacy and security, as DeepSeek faces requirements under Chinese law to comply with demands for user data and uses it to train more capable systems for the CCP’s use. Their models also more willingly generate how-to’s for illicit and harmful activities such as identity fraud and intellectual property theft, a reflection of how the CCP views violations of American IP rights as a feature, not a flaw.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This is Bloomberg Opinion Today, the right to organize Bloomberg Opinion’s opinions. Sign up here . Today’s Agenda Champagne Problems Nia-Malika Henderson has a serious question: “How do you sell America on a recession?” Because encouraging us all to buy backyard chicken coops doesn’t seem to be working. Nor are angry statements on Truth Social about how “The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!” In all honesty, it feels like we’re the ones getting ripped off. Nobody, including wine moms, wants to drink counterfeit Champagne from the Midwest. More than half of US voters believe tariffs will harm the economy. “Americans are increasingly worried about the US economic outlook and expecting price hikes for housing, college, gas and groceries,” Nia writes. Although John Authers says the latest inflation figures offered “a positive surprise for a change,” the good times may not last for long. “With the trade war looking as if it might drag on, policymakers will have to keep a watchful eye on consumer and market inflation expectations,” Jonathan Levin writes. As it is, a small iced chai in Park Slope costs $9.96, which could be about as much as you have left in your 401(k). And President Donald Trump’s tariffs — billed as a bump in the road to economic paradise — are going to make matters worse, especially for the cohort they’re supposed to help: American men. For decades, the labor market has been shifting away from men, explains Allison Schrager. “There are fewer jobs in manufacturing and more jobs in fields that have historically skewed female, such as education and health care,” she writes. “The administration’s logic seems to be that if the US re-creates the manufacturing-heavy economy of the 1950s and ‘60s, when the prime-male labor force participation rate reached 97%, more men will get back to work. But these are not the 1960s — and the blame doesn’t lie with trade.” Instead, the blame lies with technology and lack of training. “The solution to this problem is not tariffs. It is eliminating the many regulations that make it hard to build, move and change jobs,” Allison argues. And guess what could facilitate that transition to prosperity? A labor union! Too bad, as Kathryn Anne Edwards says, that there aren’t many left, thanks to decades of union-busting: “Representation is less now than 1934, the year before the right to organize was enshrined into law by the National Labor Relations Act.” Unfortunate, considering a staggering 70% of Americans approve of unions. That’s way higher than Trump’s ratings for his handling of the economy! Blackwater vs. BlackRock Remember Erik Prince? The guy who founded Blackwater who also happens to be the brother of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos? Well, he’s back, and he wants to help Trump deport millions of undocumented immigrants before the 2026 midterms. His genius plan — which was sent to Trump’s team but has not been implemented — involves spending $25 billion to erect “processing camps” on military grounds and a “small army” of private citizens who have the executive green light to make arrests. I can’t even begin to count all the red flags here, but one jumps out: We already have quality control issues with border patrol! It’s hard to believe that adding private contractors into the mix would help the situation: In the near future, Trump is expected to invoke wartime authority — i.e. the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — to kick his mass deportation effort into high gear. He’ll almost certainly get challenged on this in court; detained migrants would be stripped of all due process — no asylum interview or legal proceeding — and unceremoniously deported. It’s a step toward achieving Trump’s goal of tossing 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country. But even with private contractors and/or wartime powers, is 11 million actually realistic? Patricia Lopez has her doubts: “Achieving that number would require a mind-boggling 229,000 removals per month over the course of his term,” she writes. To give you an idea of how that compares to what’s happening on the ground, Border Czar Tom Homan netted only 20,000 for all of February. That’s not to say nothing is happening under Homan’s watch: “Trump’s obsessive energy on immigration has resulted in some clear progress,” Patricia notes. “Border crossings have fallen to historic lows, in part because Trump shut down the asylum process that had refugees camping out at the southern border.” Plus, the new administration has been savvy with its focus on crime: “Aiming squarely at removing criminal migrants may not result in large numbers — since most undocumented immigrants don’t commit crimes — but is one that most US residents would support.” Still, even if ICE were to deport all crime-committing migrants in this country, Patricia says it’d amount to just 5.7% of Trump’s 11 million goal. That’s why the most prudent thing to do may be just to drop the whole idea of mass deportation — and corporate America might even be happy about it. This week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that Trump’s harsh immigration policy could severely hinder farmers and construction workers. It’s that kind of outspokenness that Adrian Wooldridge says other CEOs ought to adapt. “Businesspeople are the only people with the personal heft and institutional power to act as a restraint on Trump,” he writes. Telltale Charts Just because American men are getting the short end of the stick doesn’t mean there aren’t winners in this trade war: “The White House’s on-again-off-again tariffs are presenting Asia with a gift,” writes Daniel Moss. “Officials have previously been torn between juicing growth and supporting their currencies.” Now, they don’t have to choose! “The yen is clawing its way back from the lowest level in more than a generation and the South Korean won's slide has abated. The Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht have steadied after a difficult patch. The rupiah has strengthened after falling toward 16,600 per dollar.” Given all that, it’s the perfect time to prioritize growth. What would you do with $19 billion? Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, may be asking himself that very question after his holding company CK Hutchison inked a blockbuster port deal with BlackRock. I know what I’d do with the money — hire Taylor Swift to serenade me at my birthday party — but Shuli Ren says the billionaire may want to use it to repair his reputation, and not in a Swiftie sort of way. You see, Li’s once-pristine track record was marred in 2015 when minority shareholders blocked a proposal to buy out another subsidiary. “This is the perhaps the last chance the 96-year-old will have to make amends with disgruntled shareholders,” she writes. Although Shuli says the family should stick to tried-and-true stock buybacks, David Fickling has a greener vision in mind: “Renewables and nuclear will provide every kilowatt-hour of additional electricity in the world between now and 2027,” he writes. He calls it “an unmissable opportunity for one of the world’s most experienced players in power generation, transmission and distribution.” Further Reading A shutdown may be averted, but at what cost? — Bloomberg’s editorial board Actually, banks do not want an atmosphere of lawlessness. — Matt Levine Don’t condemn lawyers over their clients. — Stephen L.

Title: ‘Do NOT buy’: Man spots townhouse for sale. Then he sees it’s Ryan Homes

Mars Ramos If you’re looking to buy a new home, Ryan Homes seem to be popping up all over the country. However, some people caution that they may not be worth it. Ryan Homes is one of the top five home builders in the nation, according to its website. It helps homebuyers buy a house and set them up with a team to support them throughout the process, like a project manager, sales representative, loan officer, and more. This all sounds great, but the creator of a recent video is skeptical, and others chime in to echo the video’s skepticism. “From the low 400s for just this little slab. That’s a problem, that’s a huge problem,” says TikToker Sam (@helmetbagohyeah). The video shows a sign for a new development for sale by Ryan Homes. “And they’re built so poorly,” Sam captions the video with already over 2 million views in just a day and close to 4,000 comments. Apparently, homebuyers who sign a deal with Ryan Homes have several complaints ranging from quality to mortgage payment amounts. The comments on Sam’s video demonstrate this. “All eastern states are being ambushed with these over priced cheap material townhouses,” says one comment. “‘Low 400s’ and it be $449,999,” says another. “Stay away from Ryan homes horrible,” advises another. “Build by blackrock and friends for the cheapest price possible solely to fulfill shareholders value … please check out the inspector man who checks new built properties,” shares another. “Ryan Homes … keeps on building cheap houses … with HOA,” another commenter says. Concerns with the quality of the homes are a common theme. A 2019 article explores homeowners’ complaints in Maryland as reported by Delmarva Now. According to the article, an investigation by USA Today revealed that the company “cut corners during construction and left homeowners to deal with the defects. When concerns were raised, homeowners say the company would ignore its warranties, refuse to fix the problem, leverage any repairs into nondisclosure agreements or force customers into lengthy fights, costing them thousands of dollars.” Additionally, the homes may not be as affordable as advertised. A recent Daily Dot article explores financial challenges by a recent Ryan Homes purchaser whose mortgage went from $3,200 to $5,600 a month. This was allegedly all because of unexpected property tax increases and mistakes made with Ryan Homes about the estimated monthly taxes.

Title: How to Spend $19 Billion With Blood on the Streets

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Great investors rarely fear tumultuous times. “Buy when there is blood on the streets,” in the words of a quote usually attributed to Nathan Mayer Rothschild, the British-German banker who made a fortune from the Napoleonic wars. Hong Kong’s greatest investor learned that lesson well. Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., turned himself from a plastic flower manufacturer into a property tycoon by purchasing real estate at fire-sale prices after the city’s 1967 riots. He pounced on utility HK Electric in the midst of a crisis in Sino-British relations in 1985, and made it the seed of one of the world's biggest infrastructure businesses. He started building up a ports conglomerate in the Chinese mainland eight years later, when it was still largely closed off from the world in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Right now, the conventional wisdom has decided that it's the energy transition that is bleeding all over the road. “There is more chance of Elvis speaking” than a switch to clean energy happening, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told the CERAWeek oil industry conference in Houston on Monday. Much like the apparently widespread opinion in 1815 that Napoleon's attempted restoration was anything more than a futile last gasp, that complacent view represents a spectacular buying opportunity for those who can see more clearly.(1) It might be hard to perceive this from the perspective of the oil industry's pilgrimage city in Houston (although even in Texas, about half of electricity generation this year will be zero-carbon.) Look everywhere else, however — and particularly in the markets where Li has made his fortune — and the switch that’s underway is hard to miss. Renewables and nuclear will provide every kilowatt-hour of additional electricity in the world between now and 2027, the International Energy Agency wrote last month. Global crude oil output last year was still below 2018’s figure, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, far from turning its back on clean energy, Europe is redoubling its efforts. Germany is planning a €500 billion ($546 billion) infrastructure fund as part of plans to remove public debt limits and allow more defense spending for Ukraine. “If you want to upgrade your clean-tech industries, if you want to upscale your digital infrastructure – Europe is open for business,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Such ambitions speak to CK’s historic expertise, as well as the promise of its infrastructure unit to cut emissions in half by 2035. Right now, the Lis have money burning a hole in their pockets. The agreement last week to sell the ports business to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium for cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion is a coup to rival any of the patriarch’s previous deals. (Though it’s not entirely clear the extent to which Li himself was driving the decision-making rather than his son, Chairman Victor Li.(2)) A savvy player has no desire to sit on such a jackpot, however. A lot of infrastructure investment is essentially interest rate arbitrage — buying assets with modest but inflation-protected cashflows, and betting that returns will improve as falling borrowing costs allow you to refinance at lower rates. That's exactly the situation we're facing now, as a slumping stock market and Trump’s equanimity about the prospect of a recession causes bond traders to increase their bets on a cut. As we've written, China's clean technology prowess in everything from solar panels, to batteries, to electric vehicles and charging networks is rewiring swaths of the world at astonishing speed. The next stage of Europe's decarbonization is going to require a doubling in energy transition investments up to 2030, hitting $1 trillion a year, according to BloombergNEF. That’s an unmissable opportunity for one of the world's most experienced players in power generation, transmission and distribution. The Li family have spent decades navigating the choppy waters separating the East and the West, with the same deftness that sustained so many Hong Kong businesses since the city’s origins as a 19th century colonial port. With $19 billion to spend, it's time for CK to write the next chapter in that story. More From Bloomberg Opinion: (1) While Nathan Mayer Rothschild made a fortune in the era, the exact nature of the trades he made (and particularly the question of whether his communications networks had given him advance knowledge of the victory at Waterloo) is still being debated two centuries later. (2) After retiring in 2018, the elder Li retains the title of senior advisor to the group, so you’d expect him to have had a say in such a huge transaction — but formal leadership rests with Victor Li, along with his long-time lieutenant and deputy chairman Canning Fok.

Title: Undocumented Subprime Borrowers Pose Risk to Wall Street
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/undocumented-subprime-borrowers-pose-risk-to-wall-street-11741897190288.html

(Bloomberg) -- Marcelo Rodriguez is in the middle of a chain of lending that has connected Wall Street to New York’s Spanish-speaking community, providing a lifeline to vulnerable borrowers including the undocumented. That lifeline is now starting to fray. For years, his company, InQmatic, has connected small-business owners with firms that are willing to bankroll risky loans, some of which are then bundled into securities and sold off by big banks. The lenders rarely seemed to put much effort into vetting applicants’ immigration status, Rodriguez said — until recently. “Now,” he said, “they make it clear that their preference is for borrowers to be citizens.” The shift is a byproduct of President Donald Trump’s push to, as he’s vowed repeatedly, carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” And it reveals how the chilling effect triggered by that plan is spreading fast — far faster than the actual pickup in deportations — and threatening the finances of many undocumented immigrants. It also underscores the growing dilemma that firms specializing in lending to people with checkered, or no, credit history — a group that includes many of the nation’s 14 million undocumented people — now face, even as many fintechs have made courting the unbanked a key priority in recent years. The problem is twofold: first, these lenders don’t want to risk running afoul of an administration that has made clamping down on illegal immigration a key objective. And second, they don’t want to be in the position of having to write off a loan made unpayable if a borrower is deported. By tapping a network of credit unions, non-profits, fintechs and payday lenders, foreign-born undocumented immigrants accounted for some $10 billion in interest payments and other financial transactions excluding mortgages in 2023, according to an estimate by Financial Health Network, a nonprofit that studies the financial stability of consumers. Its estimate is based on a nationally representative survey it conducted as well as information from other organizations, including a finding from Pew Research Center that one in four foreign-born people in the US are undocumented. Auto loans, in particular, stand out in this category. Many undocumented immigrants work in sectors such as hospitality, agriculture and construction and need cars to get to work. And unlike mortgages or consumer loans, which tend to be underwritten by banks that are subject to regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, auto loans to customers with lower or no credit scores are frequently underwritten by finance companies and require less documentation. Some lenders raise cash by turning to banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank, which bundle their loans into asset-backed securities that in turn are sold to investment companies that manage money on behalf of millions of Americans’ retirement accounts, pensions, or even savings accounts. To be clear, undocumented immigrants can legally obtain loans. Even if borrowers don’t have a Social Security number, they may be required to have identification for tax-paying purposes. And while Trump’s push may make the status of these loans more precarious, analysts doubt there are enough of them to have a broad effect in the more than $700 billion market for asset-backed securities, whether or not deportations accelerate as pledged. Still, it adds to risks. What happens if borrowers are simply deported from the country? Will they continue to pay their loans? “There are some pockets of heavy exposure, particularly for some auto lenders,” said Boris Peresechensky, a portfolio manager at Orange Investment Advisors. “And given the limited visibility into borrowers’ backgrounds, it’s hard to say how widespread the risk may be.” Disclosure documents already flag the risks posed to particular securities backed by loans originated by at least half a dozen companies. That includes those tied to the auto lenders First Help Financial and Tricolor Auto Group, which each cater to customers with lower-than-average or middling credit scores and explicitly focus on extending loans to immigrants. First Help says it focuses on financing working-class immigrants from Central and South America. It makes those loans through a network of over 2,400 dealers around the US, and as of last year was providing around $800 million worth of auto financing per year, according to bond rating documents. For $240 million in auto loan-backed bonds it sold this month, just over a quarter out of the roughly 4,150 borrowers it financed had Social Security numbers, according to a bond-ratings report. The company’s borrowers include people like Adriana, 46, who moved from Ecuador over a decade ago and is undocumented. She and her husband, who live in New Jersey with their two children and own a construction business, are on the hook for a $30,000 loan they obtained from First Help in 2021 to help finance their Toyota Tundra pickup truck. Like many other auto-loan companies, First Help uses asset-backed securities to effectively sell packages of auto loans like Adriana’s to end investors on Wall Street. For example, in October it issued $281 million of bonds backed by customers with middling or no credit scores, small pieces of which were purchased by dozens of investment firms including Columbia Threadneedle and Fidelity Investments. First Help has warned its own investors about risks that they face if the nation’s immigration policies were to change. Customers like Adriana demonstrate that risk in real time. If she’s deported, she’d have much bigger things to worry about than repaying auto loan debt. More broadly, experts flag the threat of economic, financial and societal disruptions from large-scale deportations. “I’m overwhelmed,” said Adriana, who declined to share her last name. “But this is a time to be strong.” First Help is owned by the Treacy family and run by a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, Pushan Sen Gupta. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Lending Surge Another lender is Texas-based auto dealer and finance company Tricolor. Partly owned by BlackRock Inc., it has sold asset-backed securities worth at least $1.6 billion since its first such deal in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Texas-based Tricolor, which has focused much of its business on the low-income Hispanic community in states such as Texas, California and Nevada, estimates that over two-thirds of its borrowers are undocumented, based on having no Social Security number. Its lending has surged to about $1 billion of auto loans each year, close to five times its volume in 2020, according to a KBRA report. “Nearly 10% of the entire workforce in California and Texas – our two primary markets – is undocumented,” said Tricolor Chief Executive Officer Daniel Chu in an emailed statement. “Our purpose is to provide them with high quality, reliable vehicles at affordable rates and set them on a path to better financial health.” Auto loans aren’t the only lending product that face fresh risks under Trump. On the campaign trail, the now-president also pledged to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants, which are generally provided by lenders in a nationwide patchwork that includes mortgage providers, credit unions and community development financial institutions. But mortgages are more heavily regulated than auto loans or other types of debt, and ultimately this market is small, with just 5,000 to 6,000 mortgages made to holders of Individual Tax Identification numbers in 2023, according to estimates from the Urban Institute. So far, the Trump administration appears to be falling short on its goals. Last month, the top two deportation officials at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were demoted and transferred amid the agency’s failure to meet daily arrest quotas. Tricolor’s Chu said he’s doubtful that the administration’s deportations will be broad enough to have a major impact on the risks of its loans. He said the majority of his clients have been working in the country for years, making them less likely to be affected as officials prioritize those with criminal records. “Our borrowers positively impact the US economy, having resided in the country for an average of 15 years and filling employment gaps in key industries like agriculture and other occupations emphasizing manual labor,” he said. But the talk of a widening dragnet has been unsettling to people like Adriana. If she’s deported, she has a plan for her children: She and her husband would transfer legal authority over them to her brother-in-law, a US citizen. “I don’t want my kids to go to a shelter,” she said. As for Rodriguez at InQmatic, he has shifted his attention to working with borrowers who do have documentation. As many as one third of his prospective borrowers are undocumented — and as many as half of his borrowers from the construction sector are undocumented. Recently, his success rate in finding willing lenders for them has dropped nearly to zero. “We used to work with some large lenders quite frequently,” said Rodriguez. “Now, it’s harder and harder to get them to agree.” --With assistance from Alicia A.

Title: Tokenized Treasuries Hit Record $4.2B Market Cap as Crypto Correction Fuels Growth

As cryptocurrencies have been battered in a broad-market correction over the past weeks, digital asset investors sought refuge in tokenized U.S. Treasury products. Since late January, the combined market capitalization of Treasury-backed tokens grew $800 million to hit a fresh all-time record of $4.2 billion on Wednesday, data source rwa.xyz shows. Real-world asset platform Ondo Finance's (ONDO) products, the short-term bond-backed OUSG and USDY tokens, climbed to just shy of $1 billion combined, a 53% surge in market value over the past month. BUIDL, the token issued jointly by asset manager BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, gained 25% during the same period to surpass $800 million. Asset manager Franklin Templeton's BENJI token expanded to $687 million, a 16% increase, while Superstate's USTB hit $363 million, up more than 63%. A notable outlier was Hashnote's USYC, shedding over 20% of its market cap to $900 million, predominantly due to DeFi protocol Usual's decline after investor backlash. The token is the main backing asset of Usual's USD0 stablecoin, which plummeted below $1 billion supply from its January peak of $1.8 billion. "We believe the growth of the tokenized treasury market cap during the recent crypto downturn reflects a flight to quality, similar to how traditional investors shift from equities to U.S. Treasuries during economic uncertainty," Brian Choe, head of research at rwa.xyz, told CoinDesk. Choe based his analysis on comparing the market cap growth of tokenized treasuries with stablecoins between November and January, when crypto markets rallied, and from February when prices corrected. During the recent bearish period, tokenized treasuries grew faster than stablecoins, contrary to the bullish phase, when stablecoin growth outpaced the treasury token market. "This signals some investors aren't exiting the ecosystem but rather rotating capital into safer, yield-bearing assets until market conditions improve," Choe said.
