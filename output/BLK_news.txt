Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-network-activity-drops-to-bear-market-levels-red-flag-or-buy-signal/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

Title: Parents concerned as embattled childcare provider Genius still without buyer

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:Child Care As troubled childcare provider Genius continues to battle financial woes, the future of its childcare centres remain in limbo. (ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.

ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets. Stakeholders must thoughtfully navigate these interconnected dynamics, capitalizing on emerging incentives and adapting proactively to maintain competitiveness and resilience. Canada’s evolving sustainability strategy under Carney’s leadership will undoubtedly impact the commercial real estate sector. It looks like 2025 marks the beginning of a new regulatory landscape. Historically, Canada’s approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation centered heavily on a consumer-facing carbon tax, designed to incentivize sustainable choices through direct financial costs. However, Carney’s administration has significantly shifted this approach, eliminating consumer carbon pricing in favor of targeted incentives and enhanced industrial regulation. Carney’s strategy retains carbon pricing mechanisms for large industrial emitters, thus continuing to leverage regulatory pressures effectively within heavy industries. Canada’s new policy notably emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nation’s global competitiveness through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This tariff not only discourages companies from relocating to countries with weaker climate regulations, but also equalizes costs associated with carbon-intensive production. This allows businesses in countries committed to ambitious climate targets to remain competitive internationally. For commercial real estate owners and operators, this raises intriguing questions: How might these industrial regulations indirectly influence property investment markets, particularly in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing, logistics, or resource extraction? Could CBAM indirectly alter property values or tenant demand patterns, compelling developers and investors to reassess site location, procurement strategies, and performance benchmarks? The results remain to be seen. Carney’s climate initiatives are also focused on incentives for the adoption of sustainable technologies, including a 31% credit rate for eligible properties acquired after January 1, 2024. The additional expansion of subsidies for electric vehicles, heat pumps, efficiency retrofits, and renewable energy installations promises to accelerate Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy. These subsidies offer the commercial real estate sector tangible financial incentives to integrate cutting-edge sustainability technologies into building design and operations. Furthermore, direct government support, such as Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Building Retrofits Initiative, will likely create favorable conditions for developers investing in sustainable construction and retrofits. Carney’s administration has explicitly committed to accelerating project approvals, such as a $175 million investment in the Hudson Bay Railway and the Port of Churchill, especially projects related to critical minerals and clean-energy infrastructure. We should also take into account the Building Emission Performance Standards, which set explicit emissions performance benchmarks for commercial buildings, incentivizing efficiency upgrades, renewable energy integration, and electrification. However, BEPS implementation poses challenges as well, especially regarding upfront retrofit costs. Cities like Vancouver address affordability concerns through targeted financial incentives and technical assistance programs, ensuring equitable compliance pathways for diverse stakeholders. Although solutions will vary across provinces, the nation-wide policy direction raises questions about whether proactive engagement in sustainability initiatives will led to competitive advantages in tenant attraction, operational cost management, or long-term asset valuation. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada released a report in April 2025 projecting that eco-friendly retrofits could save Canadians $3.8 billion over the next 20 years for at least half a million Canadian households. Perhaps most significantly, Carney’s advocacy for mandatory emissions disclosures, including Scope 3 emissions, and for structured frameworks guiding financial institutions toward sustainable investments, is expected to have widespread across the Canadian economy. His renowned maxim, "What gets measured gets managed," encapsulates his belief in data-driven transparency as a catalyst for environmental action. Real estate finance, inherently reliant on institutional lending and capital markets, stands to experience substantial shifts under these new financial sector guidelines. Mandatory climate risk disclosures could alter investment attractiveness, reshape lending practices, and influence asset valuation methodologies. Regulatory frameworks like Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan impose stringent emissions caps, substantial fines, and progressive tightening of standards. Buildings failing these benchmarks face diminished financing options, lower valuations, and decreased tenant appeal. In this regulatory landscape, institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability performance metrics, suggesting an evolving landscape where properties demonstrating superior environmental credentials will likely command valuation and rent premiums. Moreover, financial institutions and investors increasingly categorize assets failing sustainability standards as high-risk investments. Given the significant economic disruptions accompanying recent tariffs and international trade tensions, substantial stimulus investment in sustainable infrastructure, including commercial real estate, could deliver multifaceted economic benefits. For example, directing governmental funding toward sustainable commercial developments in urban cores might simultaneously stimulate economic recovery and address critical urban housing shortages through mixed-use projects. On the other hand, while Carney’s vision presents substantial opportunities, it also introduces complexities and potential risks. Carney’s historical emphasis on voluntary industry collaboration, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, underscores a preference for cooperative rather than strictly regulatory frameworks. However, voluntary approaches alone might be insufficient, as their effectiveness can be undermined by subjective interpretations with a high risk of greenwashing. For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities. By proactively integrating sustainability into strategic decision-making the industry can not only thrive economically but also significantly contribute to Canada's sustainable future. This could be achieved through leveraging emerging incentives, adapting to regulatory complexities, embracing technology, and aligning with broader societal goal. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Carney’s vision will depend on its successful translation into actionable policies, transparent governance, and genuine stakeholder collaboration. For Canadian commercial real estate, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example, demonstrating how visionary climate policy can underpin enduring economic resilience and environmental sustainability.

ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets.

Title: BlackRock Buys $2,500,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin As BTC Price Holds Steady: Arkham

New data from market intelligence firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock purchased billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset closes in on $100,000. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock, which has over $11 trillion in assets under management, bought $2.5 billion worth of BTC last week. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests Bitcoin may one day become the world’s reserve currency, replacing the US dollar. Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion – exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Arkham notes that the publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms is selling hundreds of BTC. “Riot just reported that they sold 475 BTC in April for $38.8 million. During April, they moved exactly 475 BTC to NYDIG. [Monday], they just moved another $6.7 million BTC to NYDIG. Are they selling even more this month?” Arkham data shows that the company’s portfolio now includes about 6,611 BTC, worth about $642 million at current prices. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,238.

Title: 50 Companies Now Hiring Remote Jobs In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/05/07/50-companies-now-hiring-remote-jobs-in-2025/

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Companies in tech, health, and defense industries have the greatest share of remote jobs Once upon a time, getting a good, stable job meant relocating into a big city, traveling into the office and skipping your son's baseball game while stuck for hours in never-ending traffic or the rush of the commute. Today, the workplace is being redefined. Remote work and hybrid models are popular amongst jobseekers and professionals eager to advance in their careers, and employers are embracing the challenge. Although many employers still prefer their workers to be in the office more than working from home, there's still a sizable number of companies still hiring for fully remote roles and hybrid roles too, so you can get the best of both worlds. You're able to progress your career at these companies just as well as if you were working at the office. And, at the same time, you won't have the guilt of missing out on your children's school activities or any aspect of your personal and family life. Plus, you'll even have time to work on a side hustle when you're working from home. Just a few weeks ago, FlexJobs, a popular remote and flexible work job board, analyzed the remote job listings within their database from January to March 2025. Their findings revealed that companies with the greatest share of remote job listings across that time period regularly reviewing reports like these enables you to keep a finger on the pulse of remote work trends and helps you make informed decisions as a job seeker so you can narrow down your employer choices and be more targeted with your job search. Here’s the full list: The main industries represented by these employers include healthcare (covering service providers and health insurance companies), financial services, investments and banking, IT, and defense and engineering. As a job seeker or professional passively looking for remote career opportunities, there are tons of ways to find remote work other than the traditional methods that everyone else uses, like scrolling through job boards. In fact, browsing Indeed and LinkedIn Jobs hoping for remote work opportunities is severely limiting you because there are so many other opportunities that you’re missing due to relying on stale methods. You need to remember that there is such a thing as the hidden job market, explained in detail here. In a nutshell, this means that most jobs never actually quite make it to a job board. Many are hidden within a company and you'll only find out about them through connecting with the right people and building your network strategically. Aligning yourself with decision-makers and building relationships with them will enable you to be put forward for referrals, making it easier for you to secure a job than hopelessly waiting to be progressed to the next stage after sending out hundreds of applications on Indeed. Here are some ways to find remote jobs that you probably haven’t considered: Freelancing allows you to work from anywhere on your own terms, and you could land a project as early as this week, so this is probably the fastest way to secure a contract or “job” while working from home. Applying directly on a company’s career page always beats applying for the same role via a posting on a job board. Go straight to the source as much as possible. Try: Lastly, try unconventional methods such as: If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed with this list, start your remote job search strategy by picking at least five companies from the “companies hiring” list above, researching them, tailoring your application materials, and then applying at least three of the strategies listed above to help you find more remote jobs or to connect you to the right people within these companies who would be hiring. Applying directly for remote jobs by finding outside-the-box approaches to contact hiring managers ... More allows you to secure remote work faster Try this approach each week, and you’ll find yourself hired faster than 90% of other job seekers…all because you decided to take an innovative, outside-the-box approach. You’re shifting your mindset beyond merely applying for jobs, and now you’re pitching yourself like a business, to partner with other companies to solve their problems. This adjustment is what will really make you stand out when looking for remote work.

The conclave to choose the next head of the Catholic Church has begun, following the death of Pope Francis in April. While the world waits to hear who will be named the next pope, we asked our readers to submit their views on the Catholic Church. Bill Fox (66), a retired clinical psychologist from Co Sligo, says he is “very proud to be a Roman Catholic in Ireland today”. “I have always practised my faith, apart from lapsing for a few months while I was a student. “I have been a Minister of the Word for about 30 years and a Minister of the Eucharist for about 23 years ... My religious faith has become more important to me in later life.” He says he attends Mass on a weekly basis and prays “every day”. Liam Bairéad (74), from Dublin, experienced a lapse in faith in his 20s but now describes his “sense of God at the centre of everything good” as “very strong”. A retired secondary schoolteacher, he was “raised in a strongly Catholic household”. “By the age of 20 I had turned my back on the Catholic Church and religion in general. I lost all faith in God and became, very consciously, a materialist and an atheist. [ Have Your Say: What is your view on the Catholic Church?Opens in new window ] “Then a series of incidents and encounters and my reflections on them caused me to become a lapsed atheist by the time I was 25. I returned to the practice of the Catholic faith, particularly the Mass and the Eucharist,” he says. Michael O’Flanagan (33), from Dublin, believes “the papacy of Pope Francis has opened the doors for a more welcoming and inclusive church”. “As a young person in my early 30s the papacy of Pope Francis brought me closer to the institutional church, but the humility of Pope Francis brought the institutional church closer to God,” he says. Concern regarding the continued involvement of religious orders in the Irish education system was one issue that recurred in responses. Anna McCabe (91), from Longford, says she “joined Atheist Ireland and later the Humanist Association of Ireland” after her belief in Catholic teachings faded. “I no longer believed what they taught me as a child and what I taught to primary schoolchildren for many years ... I consider teaching religion to young children as a form of child abuse. I think religion should be taught outside school.” Mike Gogan (62), a copy writer from Dublin, also chose to distance himself from the Catholic Church “as a young man in 1986”, saying he has “not looked back” since. “At the time my mother questioned my actions, but as soon as the reports of abuse started to emerge, she understood. I have not looked back and have been actively involved in trying to remove the influence of the church in our education system.” Some felt they could talk more freely without being fully identified, such as Aidan from Dublin, who said: “[I was] baptised by my parents as a Catholic and educated at Willow Park and Blackrock ... I had lost faith long before my fellow students revealed the horrific abuse at the hands of priests, but it really added to my anger thinking of the two-faced piety and sanctimony of pulpit paedophiles being enabled by the Catholic Church omertà which prevailed for so long in Ireland.” While he no longer practices nor believes “in a man-made religion”, he “still somewhat regret[s] not having a faith of any kind”, adding that “it must be a comfort to those who do”. Having grown up in south Dublin and now living in Switzerland, Seán Redmond (54) says he “wish[es] that the Catholic church was less Catholic and more Christian”. “Since I was a child, I have seen the Catholic hierarchy on one side of the current culture war we are in and the priests on another,” says Mr Redmond, describing himself as “more aligned with the poor priests than with the hierarchy”. I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times “Why can’t women be priests? Why can’t priests have children? What is wrong with being LGBTQ? Is the command to love one another as I have loved you too complicated in a patriarchal society? Why must the majority cardinals and bishops be over 70?” he asks. Paul (67), who works in the education sector in Dublin, says despite coming “from a devout Catholic family” his own faith waned and by his early teens he had “ceased to believe the bulk of Catholic teaching”. “Growing older, I began to witness so much of what I found repulsive about Catholicism,” he says, listing “the wealth of the Vatican and the grandiose pomp and ceremony that accompanies it ... the misogyny and obsession with sexuality ... and then of course, the revelations of the breadth and depravity of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by so many ordained members of the church” among examples. For others, like retired secondary schoolteacher Breid Carberry (68) from Co Donegal, Catholicism has offered solace during difficult periods. “I have had a lot of illness in my life and my Catholic faith sustains and comforts me in good times and bad,” says Carberry, reflecting on her diagnosis of breast cancer. “I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times.” [ New pope will face a Vatican budget crisis and myriad other problemsOpens in new window ] Siobhán Cullen (61), from Kildare says her religious upbringing informed her current relationship with Catholicism. “I go to Mass on Sunday and my faith is important to me. My parents were very religious, as were most parents of the 1960s, and they passed on that faith to me and my siblings. I left the church for a while in my late teens, but came back to it in my mid-20s and it has been a great source of comfort and joy to me. “I realise that this has not been the case for a lot of people and can understand how this has turned them against the church. It was truly horrendous what went on and the church should pay recompense to those victims. I have been lucky in that the priests and nuns I met were good people and did great work for the community.” Ursula (57), a self-described “cradle-Catholic”, also from Kildare, attends Mass daily. “Through faith and the 10 commandments, I don’t agree with a lot of societal change,” she says, citing abortion as an example, “but we all have free will and I can’t judge anyone. “My prayer is always ‘let not their sin become mine’. In other words, if I judge others, I am creating a greater sin. This life is where we choose to follow Jesus or not.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why The Future For Financial Advisors Is In The Private Market

ByAtish Davda ByAtish Davda, Forbes Councils Member. Atish Davda is EquityZen's CEO, former quant at AQR Capital and a Penn alum who loves FinTech, Python, traveling and tennis. The secret is out about private markets. BlackRock’s recent announcement that its model portfolios will now incorporate private market investments marks a pivotal shift in the investment landscape. This move may make a significant impact in democratizing access to private assets—something to which I’ve dedicated my career. Big market moves like this also challenge the status quo. If BlackRock’s model portfolios make private market investments the norm, financial advisors may need to rethink their strategies to remain competitive. The global economy is currently facing substantial headwinds. President Trump’s tariff announcements have injected uncertainty into the markets, with fears of a potential recession looming. These protectionist measures have led to increased market volatility, prompting investors to seek alternative avenues for diversification and stability. The market landscape makes BlackRock’s strategic shift toward private markets all the more timely. By blending private and publicly traded assets, BlackRock aims to provide investors with more diversified and resilient investment portfolios. This move reflects a broader industry trend toward incorporating alternative assets to dampen the effects of volatility, while capturing the illiquidity premium and providing the potential for better risk-adjusted returns. All market evolutions—from the launch of ETFs to SPACs—present both opportunities and challenges for financial advisors. Now that individual investors can more easily gain diversified exposure to alternatives while paying much lower fees than an advisor may charge, advisors will be challenged to further prove their value add. Here are some of the ways they can with regard to private market investments. ​ With private market investments becoming more accessible to individual investors, advisors can distinguish themselves by developing deep expertise in this market. Understanding the nuances of private assets, including their risk profiles and liquidity constraints, will be crucial.​ More financial advisors are differentiating themselves from their peers by building knowledge on the private markets. Whether providing liquidity to clients who are early employees or investors in startups or knowing the ins and outs of secondary transactions, they prove their value by their expertise in a growing, but niche market. Advisors can also consider expanding their product suite to include differentiated options that are best-suited to their clients’ individual needs. This could involve partnerships with platforms that offer access to private investments or advisors developing in-house capabilities to evaluate and recommend private assets.​ RIAs tell me that their clients seek access to the technology companies at the forefront of innovation in industries such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. There are different avenues to provide this access—each with different time horizons, investment minimums and investment structures. Much like they have with direct indexing in public portfolios, advisors can identify and curate private market products for their specific clients. As private market investments become integrated into portfolios, educating clients about these assets becomes imperative. While the private market is growing rapidly, it can still be opaque and daunting to the uninformed. Talking with clients about private investments’ potential benefits and risks will build trust.​ Not every private market investment is right for every client. Advisors can help clients understand their options and choose the most appropriate investments for their situation and goals. The financial market is undergoing a massive change as alternatives—once a wealth creation avenue only available for the ultra-wealthy—go mainstream. With the number of public companies continuing to diminish, it is more important than ever to offer this access to clients of all sizes. I steadfastly believe that the future of investments is in the private market. BlackRock’s vocal endorsement of private markets is a clarion call for financial advisors to evolve and meet this moment. By deepening their understanding of private assets, diversifying their offerings and educating clients, advisors can differentiate themselves while providing enhanced value in this new investment era. Embracing this shift is not just about staying competitive. It’s about leading the way in democratizing access to investment opportunities for all. Not all pre-IPO companies will go public or be acquired, and not all IPOs or acquisitions are or will become successful investments. There are inherent risks in pre-IPO investments, including the risk of loss of the entire investment, illiquidity, and fluctuations in value and returns. Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

Title: Greystone Housing Impact Investors Reports First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

May 07, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP OMAHA, Neb., May 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On May 7, 2025, Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Financial Highlights The Partnership reported the following results as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025: The difference between reported net income per BUC and CAD per BUC is primarily due to the treatment of unrealized losses on the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized losses of approximately $3.9 million are included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Unrealized losses are a result of the impact of decreased market interest rates on the calculated fair value of the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized gains and losses do not affect our cash earnings and are added back to net income when calculating the Partnership’s CAD. The Partnership received net cash from its interest rate derivative positions totaling approximately $847,000 during the first quarter. In March 2025, the Partnership announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC declared a regular quarterly distribution to the Partnership's BUC holders of $0.37 per BUC. The distribution was paid on April 30, 2025, to BUC holders of record as of the close of trading on March 31, 2025. Management Remarks “We continue to evaluate investment opportunities despite continuing market volatility,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our successful Series B Preferred Units issuance provides low-cost, non-dilutive capital for us to deploy into accretive investment opportunities. In addition, the dedicated pool of capital that we have from the new BlackRock construction lending joint venture is a powerful tool for us to serve our affordable housing developer relationship base.” Recent Investment and Financing Activity The Partnership reported the following updates for the first quarter of 2025: In May 2025, the managing member of Vantage at Helotes sold the property to a governmental entity who in turn leased the property to a non-profit entity. That non-profit entity financed its purchase of the leasehold interest by issuing tax-exempt and taxable bonds. The Partnership received gross proceeds of approximately $17.1 million, inclusive of the return of capital contributions and accrued preferred return. The Partnership expects to recognize investment income of approximately $1.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $163,000 in the second quarter of 2025, before settlement of final proceeds and expenses. The Partnership expects to recognize approximately $0.08 of net income per BUC, basic and diluted, and CAD per BUC, based on the number of BUCs outstanding on the date of sale. Investment Portfolio Updates The Partnership announced the following updates regarding its investment portfolio: Earnings Webcast & Conference Call The Partnership will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday, May 7, 2025 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Partnership’s First Quarter 2025 results.

About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis. The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by its Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated December 5, 2022 (the “Partnership Agreement”), taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments. Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP press releases are available at www.ghiinvestors.com. Safe Harbor Statement Certain statements in this press release are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include, but are not limited to, phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “future,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “estimates,” “potential,” “continue,” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe objectives, plans, or goals also are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Partnership. The Partnership cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, implied, or projected by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: defaults on the mortgage loans securing our mortgage revenue bonds and governmental issuer loans; the competitive environment in which the Partnership operates; risks associated with investing in multifamily, student, senior citizen residential properties and commercial properties; general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war) on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; any effects on our business resulting from new U.S. domestic or foreign governmental trade measures, including but not limited to tariffs, import and export controls, foreign exchange intervention accomplished to offset the effects of trade policy or in response to currency volatility, and other restrictions on free trade; adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; the general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which the Partnership operates, which may be unfavorably impacted by pressures in the commercial real estate sector, incrementally higher unemployment rates, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies the Partnership may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on investments and cost of financing; the aggregate effect of elevated inflation levels over the past several years, spurred by multiple factors including expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, higher commodity prices, a tight labor market, and low residential vacancy rates, which may result in continued elevated interest rate levels and increased market volatility; the Partnership’s ability to access debt and equity capital to finance its assets; current maturities of the Partnership’s financing arrangements and the Partnership’s ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; local, regional, national and international economic and credit market conditions; recapture of previously issued Low Income Housing Tax Credits in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; geographic concentration of properties related to investments held by the Partnership; changes in the U.S. corporate tax code and other government regulations affecting the Partnership’s business; and the other risks detailed in the Partnership’s SEC filings (including but not limited to, the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K). Readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or if any of the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements proves to be incorrect, the developments and future events concerning the Partnership set forth in this press release may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our expectations and beliefs to change. The Partnership assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the federal securities laws. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit), and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership’s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the BUCs Distributions described in Note 22 of the condensed consolidated financial statements on a retroactive basis for all periods presented): MEDIA CONTACT: Karen Marotta Greystone 212-896-9149 Karen.Marotta@greyco.com INVESTOR CONTACT:Andy GrierInvestors Relations402-952-1235 OMAHA, Neb., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced today that it will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday,...

Let Banking Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The investment fintech, targeting a $4 billion valuation, is expected to launch on the Nasdaq index May 14. Social investment fintech eToro is seeking to raise $500 million through its initial public offering in the U.S., targeting a valuation of $4 billion and an expected IPO date of May 14. The firm and some of its shareholders are offering 10 million shares for between $46 and $50 each, according to a securities filing, half of which are being offered by the company and half by the shareholders. Founded in 2007 in Tel Aviv, Israel by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia and cofounder David Ring, eToro is a social trading app that allows users to replicate the trading strategies of top investors. It has over 40 million users, according to the securities filing. After first filing in late March, eToro put a hold on its IPO pursuit due to tariff-related market volatility that followed President Donald Trump’s major tariffs announcement in early April, Bloomberg reported. Buy now,pay later fintech Klarna also paused its IPO for the same reason, The Wall Street Journal reported. But in eToro’s May 5 IPO filing, the company said that certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, the firm’s cornerstone investor, have indicated an interest in purchasing as much as $100 million in shares at the IPO price. For 2024, eToro reported a net contribution of $787 million in 2024 and net income of $192 million. The figures represent a 41% increase and 1,161% increase, respectively, from the prior year, according to the filing. The company is in a quiet period following the IPO filing and did not provide comment beyond the press release. eToro was among the firms named by fintech investor Nigel Morris, QED Investors co-founder, as part of a “generation” likely to file IPOs this year. “In 2021, there were 61 fintech IPOs,” he said during his keynote at Fintech Meetup in March. “Since 2021, there’s been a total of 13.” “Now we have a cohort of companies that are at scale, they’re profitable, they’re growing fast, that have business models that make sense,” he said, naming Klarna, Circle and eToro. All three have since filed an IPO. “Notwithstanding the turbulence of the angry markets this week and today … there’s no doubt that these companies are IPO-ready and will be [in] the right window, either at the end of this quarter or next quarter, that will see a whole generation of them,” Morris said. “And with that, there’ll be a wave of valuations that are market-tested … these are really powerful and capable companies.” eToro’s IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS and Citi. Shares are expected to trade under the ticker symbol ETOR on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Clinch $1.8B Weekly Inflows, Will Bulls Retest $100k Price?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-clinch-1-8b-weekly-inflows-will-bulls-retest-100k-price/

Crypto institutional investors ramp up inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs following a swift recovery and expected price consolidation. The last seven days saw a net jump in total digital asset products alongside soaring trading volumes. As institutional sentiment spikes, traders are primed for a run above $100k, although certain macro indicators could hinder the upward drive. On-chain data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs added $1.8 billion, triggering bullish sentiments in the last seven days. This comes from renewed speculation for a massive price jump in May. Following the last dip and the recovery, which kicked off in the previous two weeks, traders began high-end accumulations seeking to break new positions. Traditional investors also caught the wave as they shifted through gears. According to SoSoValue data, net inflows topped $40.25 billion on May 2, marking the highest level since Feb 11. These products gained traction after the previous two months as the White House lowered tariff pressure. The previous week saw a much larger $3 billion inflow coming off a string of outflows. Currently, bull pressures are backed by new centralized institutions increasing their appetite for the asset class. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have intensified acquisitions in the same period. Last month, Cantor, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex announced plans to roll out a Bitcoin acquisition firm. This influx of institutional demand has shaped trader confidence as they aim for new cycle peaks. Per pseudonymous Bitcoin enthusiast BlockChair, metrics are strengthening due to huge ETF inflows. “Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to accelerate. With spot ETFs absorbing 6x the weekly mined supply and BlackRock dominating holdings, the supply squeeze narrative grows stronger. A 2% BTC allocation across traditional portfolios would indeed be transformative.” For most digital asset commentators, the next point is another push through the $95k price to set the tone for a larger $100k level. After swings in the past few months, this psychological level remains important for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin price dropped 22% from an all-time high above $108k, ushering in fresh outflows in the wider market. If the price reclaims $100k this month, bulls’ projections could be in play due to skyrocketing institutional inflows and on-chain metrics. Long-term holders are back in the green zone, spiking new retail investors.

Business FILE PHOTO: Dark clouds are seen over the building of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, June 6, 2024. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo LONDON : The rush to cut interest rates at major central banks slowed to a trickle in April, as policymakers faced uncertainty on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the wake of escalating trade tensions. Two of the five central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies that held meetings in April - the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand – lowered interest rates by a cumulative 50 basis points. Rate setters in Australia, Japan and Canada left benchmarks unchanged, while central banks in Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Britain and the United States did not meet in April. In February, half of the G10 central banks cut interest rates. The main focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its rate setting meeting later on Wednesday.

Title: IBIT acquires 5,613 BTC worth $530M in one day – Details and effects!

Is BlackRock triggering the next crypto bull run? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has reignited investor momentum with a powerful streak of 15 straight days of inflows. This has simply underscored renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin [BTC]. On 5 May alone, the asset manager acquired 5,613 BTC, valued at approximately $530 million – Solidifying IBIT’s dominance in a week where most other ETFs saw flat or negative flows. With total inflows since inception now surpassing $44 billion, BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation reinforces its outsized influence on the broader crypto ETF landscape. It also means that institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure remains strong. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted, “Deja vu in the weekly flows w/ $VOO and $IBIT in the top spots, just like last year when ‘beta with a side of bitcoin’ was the big theme. $IBIT now 8th in YTD flows (was out of Top 50 at one point) with +$6.4b. Been hoovering up btc like a madman ever since the decoupling.” In the thread, he further added, “One interesting note also is $IBIT taking in SO much more then the rest of them (altho 10 of them have seen inflows). Usually there’s much more parity tho. Why is this? My theory, return of the HF basis trade and some big fish biting after the decoupling and subsequent rally.” Additionally, Bitcoin’s stability above the $90,000 threshold, even after a modest 0.42% dip in the last 24 hours, alluded to growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. This price level, once seen as highly ambitious, now might be a stepping stone towards the psychological $100,000-mark. Notably, key technical indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were in bullish territory at press time. This reinforced the idea that short-term dips may be part of a healthy consolidation phase, rather than a reversal. Source: Trading View Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT has been seeing renewed investor appetite for quite some time too. Even on 24 April, IBIT recorded massive inflows worth $442 million. Needless to say, Blackrock’s success is not just limited to Bitcoin. Even in the case of Ethereum [ETH], Blackrock’s ETHA has been the reason behind the cumulative inflows spot ETH ETFs have been getting. The scale of institutional influx is a sign that market participants may be positioning for another leg up. It also further strengthens the case for a sustained rally in the coming weeks.

Title: Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victims

The Spiritan congregation has been accused of putting its own interests, needs and concerns before survivors of abuse in schools run by them. The Restore Together advocacy group for survivors of abuse in Spiritan-run schools has said: “Our experience is that the Spiritans have failed at every stage, from the time of the abuse onwards, to put the interests and rights of victims/survivors first. The Spiritans have invariably put their interests, needs and concerns and those of the institution first.” The accusation is in a lengthy letter written on behalf of the group by survivor Philip Feddis, who attended Blackrock College. Last month it was sent to past pupils’ unions at Blackrock College, Willow Park, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. Easter, it said, was “a time for Spiritan priests to reflect on the adequacy of their response to child sex abuse”. The “victim/survivor experience” involving Spiritans was “not one of compassion”, it said. “Victims/survivors feel frustrated, disappointed, angry and worse. The ongoing delay in implementing the comprehensive restorative programme has increased the suffering of victims/survivors in many ways. It is not compassionate, it is cruel.” It pointed out that “a comprehensive, victim-centred redress scheme and a testimony-gathering (truth-telling) project has still not been delivered and the Spiritans have made no commitment to a start date for either. This is completely unacceptable to victims/survivors; most of us are over 60, who have already waited far too long for justice.” [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Because of the age factor, “urgent delivery is vital for the success of these redress and testimony programmes”, the letter said. “A constant refrain is that victims/survivors are tired. We are tired of being ignored and marginalised. We are tired of feeling betrayed and abandoned by institutions that were supposed to protect and care for us as children.” It noted how “Restore Together recently called on the Spiritans to finalise the redress scheme without further delay and have it up and running no later than June 1st this year. The Spiritans have not responded to this call. We in Restore Together have been more than patient.” Survivors, the group said, are “tired of having to fight and push the Spiritans every step of the way to fully and comprehensively face up to the issue of child sex abuse in their schools and `do the right thing’. We are tired of being told we will have to wait.” The “historic power imbalance that we as victims/survivors experienced as children and which facilitated our abuse is still present and underpinning the current situation. This compounds the suffering of victims/survivors and has to be ended for once and for all. The Spiritans must take all immediate steps to bring justice to victims/survivors without having to be pushed every step of the way to do so,” it said.

Title: A county pension fund in Pennsylvania just became the first known to cease purchasing new Tesla stocks
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-pension-fund-halts-new-tesla-investments-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-07T03:41:17Z

A swing county in Pennsylvania has decided it will no longer purchase new Tesla stock, citing CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's declining shares. Lehigh County, which is toward the east of Pennsylvania and has a relatively affluent population, has a county pension board that oversees $500 million in assets. It's the first known US pension fund to stop purchasing new Tesla stock. "Elon Musk's choice to become a political figure rather than a customer-focused leader has compromised the Tesla brand," Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller who first introduced a motion to cease Tesla investments, said in a joint statement with organizers of Tesla Takedown. "Tesla's earnings are down 71% from a year ago, their auto revenues have dropped 20%, and profitability has taken a sharp dive," Pinsley added. "We owe it to our retirees and taxpayers to take a hard look at whether these are wise investments at this time." On Tuesday, the board not only voted to hit the brakes on new Tesla investments in a 4-2 decision, but it also directed the county's investment manager to draft a report outlining options to divest its passively managed funds from Tesla. The Lehigh County Controller's Office and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comments. Pinsley and the retirement board of Lehigh County aren't the only ones concerned about pensions invested in Tesla. In March, a group of 51 New York State legislators called on the state to divest its $1 billion in Tesla holdings. A top contender in the New York City comptroller race has pledged to pull the city's $300 billion pension portfolio out of Tesla if elected. Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller, has also been vocal about his dissatisfaction with Musk's leadership, but he stopped short of calling for a divestment in his office's latest response to Business Insider in April. The city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, yet this figure had shrunk to $831 million by March 28, according to the comptroller's office. In April, eight state treasurers wrote a joint letter to Tesla's board to express concern over Musk's lack of focus on Tesla, and the American Federation of Teachers is pressing major asset managers — including BlackRock and Vanguard — to consider divestment. Beyond the US border, the Netherlands' largest pension fund offloaded its $600 million stake in Tesla in January. Denmark's $20 billion pension fund, AkademikerPension, followed suit in March. Recently, Canada's largest public-sector union also urged national pension funds to cut ties with Tesla, though divestments have yet to happen. Tesla has been facing growing pressure over Musk's governance of the company and his political activity. The Tesla Takedown movement that emerged in protest of Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office is looking to evolve beyond demonstrations. The movement's next goal is to help cities and states develop resolutions to divest in "all things Musk," according to a statement on April 22 after Tesla reported earnings. As of Tuesday, Tesla stock has declined more than 27% since the beginning of 2025, and its Q1 revenue missed expectations. Musk announced during the latest earnings call that he would be stepping back from his political activities at the White House. Marketing experts previously told BI that Tesla had alienated its core customer base and that rebranding efforts might require significant concessions from Musk. "To some degree, Musk can say, 'I don't care because I'm so rich and I've got so many other entities that I could afford to lose a lot of money.'" David J. Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, previously told BI. "But for the other shareholders who are bailing on the company, that's problematic." Jump to

Title: $330B Bitcoin Corporate Surge? Why BTC Bull Token Could Be Poised to Benefit

Bernstein predicts that corporate treasuries could hold $330B worth of Bitcoin by 2029. That prediction indicates an ongoing change of heart from Wall Street — and could prime BTC Bull token to explode in 2025. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, used to be a Bitcoin critic. Now, Blackrock offers $IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF on the market, controlling $55B of the $116B Spot Bitcoin AUM (assets under management). Bernstein’s latest report projects a staggering $330B in corporate Bitcoin holdings by 2029, a figure that underscores the growing role of $BTC in mainstream finance. According to Bernstein’s research, companies worldwide could allocate up to 5% of their treasuries to Bitcoin by 2029, translating to an estimated $330 billion inflow. That trajectory – Bitcoin as a strategic asset, rather than just another kind of tech stock – marks a dramatic turnaround. If sovereign wealth funds sink 3-5% of their assets into Bitcoin, the crypto’s price could reach astronomically high levels; $700K, per an earlier Fink prediction. The question remains: are funds buying Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) certainly is. It continues to amass Bitcoin at a prodigious rate. After snapping up another 1,800+ Bitcoin, the company holds 555,450 $BTC. There will eventually be only 21M Bitcoin, so Strategy already holds a little over 1 out of every 42 potential tokens. Put another way, the stated goal of the US Bitcoin Treasury is to purchase 1M Bitcoin. Saylor’s already halfway there by himself. Strategy’s stock has grown 2,476% since buying its first Bitcoin in August 2020, validating Saylor’s increasingly aggressive approach to purchasing Bitcoin. The key to Bitcoin’s success will be if it continues to decouple from equities. And if Bitcoin gets even close to that $700K mark, then another group of crypto investors will have already made huge gains – anyone who owns BTC Bull token, one of the best crypto to buy now. How can average investors compete with institutions that can drop billions into Bitcoin treasuries? With BTC Bull token ($BTCBULL), there’s a way. $BTCBULL is designed to give everyday crypto enthusiasts leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s market movements, without the complexity of managing futures or options. $BTCBULL uses two simple tokenomics tools to tie $BTCBULL’s performance to Bitcoin’s growth. Both tools are triggered whenever Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. Those milestones occur every time Bitcoin’s price reaches an all-time high, in $25K increments up to $250K. Of course, if Bernstein’s prediction is correct, then the team behind BTC Bull might have severely undershot with their project’s goals. Regardless, $BTCBULL token holders gain three ways to earn from the project: The project has already raised $5.3M, with a current token price of $0.0025. Our analysis shows that the token price could reach $0.06467 by the end of the year, with the potential for even greater gains if Bitcoin accelerates rapidly. Learn how to buy BTC Bull token, and visit the presale page today. As institutional Bitcoin adoption grows, retail investors seek vehicles that maximize their upside potential. $BTCBULL is perfectly positioned to fill that gap, offering amplified returns tied directly to Bitcoin’s price movements. And the better Bitcoin does, the better the outlook for the best altcoins, which will also benefit from market momentum. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile. With bullish momentum across the market and growing mainstream acceptance, projects like BTCBULL could become key players for traders aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next growth cycle.
