Title: ‘Fellas who were taking the piss are now looking for tips’: at home in the garden with Ireland and Munster rugby star Peter O’Mahony

When Peter O’Mahony isn’t sinking his studs into the world’s greatest rugby pitches, he’s tending to the pristine grass on his own lawn. His love of gardening was brought to international attention during the World Cup when his mother, Caroline, held up a sign declaring she was watering his lawn while he was gone. So the question on everyone’s lips is: was it true? Did she water his lawn? “She did not,” he laughs. “She absolutely did nothing in my garden. I don’t know how she ended up with that sign, to be honest with you. I must get her doing some watering now after that.” The Munster and Ireland flanker’s interest in gardening is not a recent fad. As a child, he loved to help the gardener when he visited his grandmother Maura Conroy in Cork’s Richmond Hill. “They were my earliest memories of spending time in the garden,” he recalls. “Simple stuff, but I remember it being very enjoyable.” His grandmother died last year, but he has something to remember her by in his garden – a Japanese maple tree. “I moved it from her garden a few years ago. It has taken a while to settle in, but this is the first year it has really bloomed nicely.” The garden was one of the features that drew him and his wife Jessica to their home in Blackrock, Co Cork, 10 years ago. “We used to walk by the house a lot and say if it ever came up for sale we’d love to buy it, and all of a sudden it did.” Since then, they have been gradually redeveloping the house and garden. “It was a beautiful old cottage garden, a bit wilder than now, but lots of lovely stuff,” he recalls. When they moved in, he started with the lawn, naturally. “Some people find cutting grass a chore. I don’t. I enjoy it,” he says. As a child he mowed lawns for neighbours, including former Ireland and Munster rugby player Frankie Sheahan. “He used to give me a few bits of gear instead of money. I was delighted with the gear and chatting with Frankie at the time was great fun.” Taking on a mature garden of this size – about 200sq m (2,150sq ft) – was a daunting task, and on reflection he feels he rushed into the work. He would advise anyone in a similar situation to wait a season or two and watch how the garden grows. “But I’m quite impatient to be honest, so that was never going to happen.” Many people are now asking him for advice since he began posting about the garden on Instagram (@peteomahony), where he has amassed more than 300,000 followers. A video of him trimming the sides of the lawn on TikTok (@peteromahony6) has been viewed 5.3 million times. His Annabelle hydrangeas with their giant mophead flowers have garnered much envy. “They have taken over, to be honest with you,” he says. “I didn’t realise how big they were going to get, but it looks well in summer, that kind of block planting.” Weeded, edged, trimmed & seeded some patches. #lawncare But not everything succeeded. “I love wisteria, but I struggle with it. I tried it a couple of times in pots, but I think that’s a bad idea because it’s a hungry, vigorous plant that needs to be in the ground, so that failed a couple times,” he says. “I’ve let a couple things die, watering wise, unfortunately, being away.” Some of his plans for the garden have been held back by his heavy training schedule and travel demands. “I’d love to grow more food, but I don’t have the time at the moment,” he says. “You need to be on top of stuff all the time, but I need to be able to drop things and go for a week or two at a time. And during the summer things get crazy when you are growing food. I’ll definitely get stuck into it more when I finish playing.” But he still finds time to grow potatoes, beetroot and salad leaves. “We have some raspberries and other berries that come back every year. They need to be cut in spring and [we] try to get them picked before the birds get them. And we have a line of apple and pear trees, male and female, that pollinate themselves. Trees are foolproof once you give them the bit of pruning that they need.” He says the garden is starting to mature nicely now. “I was lucky to be able to put some mature shrubbery and plants in there that gave it some structure quite quickly.” It made a perfect backdrop when he and Jessica decided to get married in the garden during the Covid pandemic. “It was lovely. We had our immediate family in the garden and getting it ready gave me something to focus on.” While he’s happy to share his knowledge with other gardeners, he is also keen to learn from the experts. “I’ve always watched Gardeners’ World and I enjoy that. I like Adam Frost and Monty Don obviously is very enjoyable to watch,” he says. “I used to spend a lot of time in west Cork with my uncle who worked as a greenkeeper and grew a lot of his own stuff. He definitely taught me a lot.” And judging by the videos he posts on Instagram, his three children are now learning from him. Their youngest child, Ralph, seems to have inherited his father’s love of lawncare and is often seen pushing a toy lawn mower. “We have lots of songbirds and the kids have their books on recognising the different types of birds. Theo is definitely into the wildlife side of things. He’s very interested in bugs and bees and birds and fishing,” he says. “Indie then is very much into the neat and tidy stuff, keeping things where they should be. And Ralph just runs around trying to break everything up. If they want to get stuck into it, they’re more than capable of digging holes and damaging things.” Speaking of digging holes, his Ireland team-mate Bundee Aki had been threatening to damage his prized lawn for a long time. So when O’Mahony hosted a party after the Six Nations victory and Bundee grabbed a spade, he had good reason to worry. “Bundee put a few divot holes in it,” he says. “I do two or three days on the lawn every spring and autumn to level it and reseed it, so I knew that was coming up and I wasn’t too bothered. But I told him if he went near the flowers or the shrubs there would have been serious trouble.” When he first started posting about his garden on social media, a few team-mates seized the opportunity for some slagging. “But now a lot of the fellas who were taking the piss a bit are all of a sudden looking for tips on what to put where or should I put this in that pot, that sort of thing. There’s a lot of advice being requested.” With all eyes on his retirement plans now that he’s in his last season with Munster, will gardening play a role in that post-rugby future? “I certainly have plans,” he says. “I don’t know about a career, but I certainly have an interest in working on that side of things.” “I’ve always been lucky that I’ve done something that I have a huge passion for, and I have been paid well to do it so I don’t want to get stuck into something that I’m not very passionate about. I’m lucky that I am passionate about this. I’ll definitely do something in that space, but you’ll have to wait and see.” Watch out, Monty Don. There’s a new gardener in town. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin – THIS key signal suggests BTC’s next ATH will be in November

Bitcoin may be ready to climb to new levels over the next few months. Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, driving momentum towards a much-anticipated bull market. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66k, sparking excitement for potential new all-time highs (ATHs) in the final quarter of the year. Here, it’s worth looking at historical data though. Particularly the 2-week Ichimoku Cloud indicator since it has accurately predicted Bitcoin’s ATHs in past cycles. With the current cycle progressing ahead of schedule, there’s probably no need to wait for the moving averages to cross. The leading spans show us when it will happen, indicating that a new high may be formed in November. Source: CryptoCon/X Many are now wondering if November will be the month Bitcoin hits new heights. Especially with institutions and traders keeping a close eye on this timeline. One key factor supporting this possibility is the repetition of the 2019 pattern. The Gaussian Channel on the 3-day BTC chart has turned red, which has historically occurred only twice – During the Covid crash and during Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s previous bull run. When this pattern last emerged during Covid 19, it led to a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin to new ATHs. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could be poised for another major upwards move, and potentially new highs in November. Source: X However, market dynamics will ultimately determine the outcome, and it remains to be seen if this pattern will indeed lead to higher prices. Another factor that could propel Bitcoin higher is the impact of heavily borrowed USDT. Traders have been borrowing large amounts of USDT to buy Bitcoin. However, instead of pushing the price up, it initially led to a decline, causing over-leveraged traders to face losses. This type of market behavior often precedes a significant rally. Especially as retail traders are shaken out through liquidations. If the current trend continues, this will create a perfect setup for Bitcoin to surge to new highs, potentially in November. Source: Hyblock Capital Moreover, BlackRock’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin lends further confidence to the bullish outlook. Earlier this week, BlackRock (IBIT) purchased 4,460 BTC, worth $289 million, increasing its total holdings to over 362,000 BTC. This was followed by another purchase of 1,434 BTC worth $94.3 million. Recently, they added another 5,894 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 363,626 BTC, valued at $23.68 billion. BlackRock’s significant and ongoing investment in Bitcoin means that they foresee substantial price appreciation, possibly as soon as November. Source: Lookonchain/X With historical patterns, market dynamics, and institutional support all aligning, Bitcoin’s price could hit new highs in the near future. The potential for a bullish run remains strong, and traders and investors will be closely monitoring developments as November approaches. If these factors come together, Bitcoin may not only hit new ATHs but also establish itself firmly in higher price ranges for the rest of the year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto On Verge Of Losing Iconic Top Bitcoin Holder Crown To U.S. BTC ETFs

After less than a year of trading on Wall Street, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are well on pace to surpass the estimated BTC stack of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Should this accumulation trend continue, the Bitcoin ETFs may collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi by as early as this Christmas. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds now trading on American stock exchanges have amassed an astounding $17.8 billion in inflows in 2024 — representing a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC. That is just about 84,000 BTC away from the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. The ETFs are closing in on Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC stash, which the world’s most elusive man mined in the infancy of Bitcoin and hasn’t touched after disappearing more than 13 years ago. And the spot Bitcoin ETFs now aren’t far behind. The January launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Billions of dollars have hit the funds as investors previously scared off from crypto investing finally got a safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin. The top three ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have accumulated 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. In total, all the BTC ETFs need to load up on roughly 183,953 BTC to surpass Satoshi’s believed tally. If these funds continue increasing their Bitcoin reserves at the same rate, they could overtake Satoshi’s stockpile and kick him off the top. US bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock.. pic.twitter.com/kTxlIzjJy6 Tolou Capital Management founder Spencer Hakimian shared Balchunas’s sentiment, predicting that “ETFs are going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas”, to which the Bloomberg pundit agreed, adding that BlackRock’s ETF alone will at some point top the list of Bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, a top crypto market analyst has recently posited that the fast-rising concentration of Bitcoin by spot ETFs is the main reason the United States is “regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings,” compared to the rest of the world.

Title: Carlyle joins list of possible Thames Water rescue backers
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/carlyle-joins-list-of-possible-thames-water-rescue-backers-13223719
Time Published: 2024-09-28T13:53:00Z
Full Content:
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will appoint an independent monitor to Thames Water as soon as next week as the utility inches closer to collapse, Sky News understands. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 28 September 2024 16:09, UK Carlyle, the American investment giant, has become the latest global fund to weigh an investment in Thames Water as the stricken utility races to avoid being nationalised. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which has roughly $435bn in assets under management, is at the very preliminary stages of assessing whether an investment in Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) would be viable. Britain's biggest water and wastewater company, which has about 16 million customers, is edging towards the brink of collapse after warning in recent days that its financial liquidity is set to expire months earlier than previously anticipated. It has also seen its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by two leading rating agencies. Carlyle is one of a long list of prospective investors approached by Rothschild, the investment bank advising Thames Water's board, as the utility scrambles to raise more than £3bn in the coming months. This weekend, people close to the process confirmed that Carlyle had been approached but said it was "too early" to judge whether the firm might participate in a rescue deal through one or more of its funds. Among the others sounded out by Rothschild are Brookfield, the Canadian investment giant, and Global Infrastructure Partners, which is now owned by BlackRock. Uncomfortable truth is that Thames Water's fate may be out of existing management's hands Thames Water lines up court dates to push through huge debt restructuring Thames Water seeks 52% hike to bills by 2030 as industry criticises watchdog's curbs Many investors and industry analysts believe, however, that the Rothschild-led process is destined to fail given the massive financial restructuring which faces Thames Water. The company has about £16bn in debt, with approximately £10bn of that accounted for by a group of 90 funds which have appointed Jefferies and Akin Gump to represent them. That syndicate is now preparing its own rescue plan in the coming weeks, which is likely to include an enormous debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out the existing shareholders. Thames Water's future remains so shrouded in uncertainty because the industry watchdog, Ofwat, has rejected the company's initial spending plans for the next five-year regulatory period. The company is now engaged in discussions with Ofwat ahead of its final determination in December. A bridging loan of about £1bn is being contemplated by some of Thames Water's creditors, but some stakeholders remain sceptical that any new financing will be forthcoming without greater regulatory certainty. "Until the lenders know what they are bridging to, the concern deepens that they risk throwing good money after bad," said one fund. TWUL's board is said to have met in the last 48 hours to discuss the implications of its latest rating downgrades and impending liquidity shortfall. One creditor said that Ofwat was expected to appoint an independent monitor next week to scrutinise the company's progress against its turnaround plan. Ofwat, which signalled in August that it would make such an appointment, declined to comment. If new investment into Thames Water is not forthcoming before it runs out of cash, the government will have little choice but to sanction the temporary nationalisation of the company. This would be done through a Special Administration Regime (SAR), a procedure tested only once before when Bulb Energy collapsed in 2021. As part of its contingency planning for implementing a far-reaching restructuring, Thames Water has booked court dates in November to progress a rescue deal. A source close to the company said that Thames Water "continues to look at all options for extending its liquidity and raising new equity". "Reserving court dates is sensible forward planning and a part of keeping all options open."

Title: Jonathan Skrmetti’s Top 5 Successes as Tennessee’s Attorney General

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) Audrey Streb Audrey Streb is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. As Tennessee’s attorney general for only two years, Republican Jonathan Skrmetti is racking up wins for conservatives in policy and law against the Biden-Harris administration and private sector actors. One of those successes looms at the U.S. Supreme Court, where in the term that begins Oct. 1 the justices are expected to take up the federal government’s attempt to kill a Tennessee law restricting gender transitions for children. In the case, called United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, the high court will hear arguments and then decide whether the Tennessee law violates the Constitution in attempting to protect minors subjected to dangerous, life-altering medical procedures. “Twenty-five different states have enacted similar, and in some cases, identical laws,” Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. The Tennessee ban is “very logical, very reasonable, and very constitutional,” Perry said, noting that Skrmetti is “working overtime to defend children.” The state law bans puberty blockers, hormones, and gender-transition surgeries for minors. In court filings, Skrmetti and other Tennessee officials argued that gender-reassignment surgery on minors has “exploded” in recent years and that these procedures are “unproven and risky.” Skrmetti, now 47, was sworn in as attorney general on Sept. 1, 2022. Married and the father of four, the Franklin resident previously was chief deputy attorney general under his predecessor, Herbert H. Slatery III, for three years. Mr. President, no matter the intention, changes to the law must come from Congress — not from agency bureaucrats.Separation of powers is the fundamental principle of American government. https://t.co/pyYWfs10HM Skrmetti also was chief counsel to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican. “His reputation is really stellar,” Heritage’s Perry said of Skrmetti, calling him “an excellent attorney general who is highly revered.” Skrmetti received degrees from George Washington University, the University of Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Unlike in other states, Tennessee’s chief law enforcement officer is appointed by the state Supreme Court for an eight-year term, rather than elected by voters for a four-year term. (The office, whose official title is attorney general and reporter, is thus part of Tennessee’s judicial branch rather than its executive branch.) Aides and other admirers say that as attorney general, Skrmetti has spearheaded successful lawsuits against the federal government, especially leading the charge against gender ideology mandates and government overreach. Here’s a look at what they characterize as some of his biggest challenges and successes. Skrmetti’s duties as attorney general include protecting the state’s consumers, and supporters say he has risen to that task. Skrmetti filed a lawsuit against one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock Inc., in a “first-of-its-kind” consumer protection case. Tennessee successfully sued BlackRock over misleading statements about its use of ESG standards (for environmental, social, and governance considerations) in investments. Ordinary shareholders argue that ESG standards elevate over “social justice” and other progressive causes over profitability and good business practices. Skrmetti has been at the forefront of battles with progressives over gender ideology, most notably foiling the Biden-Harris administration’s proposed Title IX changes. The administration’s adjustments would have mandated that biological boys be allowed to play girls sports at school and to use girls’ restrooms and locker rooms, among other things. Despite facing several challenges from the Biden-Harris Justice Department, Skrmetti successfully defended Tennessee’s ban on so-called gender-affirming care for children. This is the case pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorney general also won a U.S. District Court case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which sought to mandate that medical providers perform, and insurers cover, some sex-change procedures. Skrmetti also went to the District Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to successfully defend Tennessee’s policy forbidding a change in the biological sex listed on birth certificates. Skrmetti also has had success in responding to the Biden-Harris administration’s undoing of border security measures imposed by the Trump-Pence administration. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border-related agencies, over its refusal to share records regarding the “catch and release” of illegal aliens who were transported to Tennessee. The case is called Tennessee v. Mayorkas, after DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Early this year, Skrmetti successfully sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its revised regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The agency’s revision would have forced employers to pay for their employees’ abortions, he argued. “I’m proud to lead the coalition fighting to protect the rule of law against this unconstitutional federal overreach,” Skrmetti said in a public statement. “Congress passed the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect mothers-to-be and promote healthy pregnancies, and the EEOC’s attempt to rewrite that law into an abortion mandate is illegal.” When it comes to government and private sector policies focused on or mandating so-called DEI—diversity, equity, and inclusion—Skrmetti has been proactive in expressing concerns. The Tennessee attorney general last year co-led a 13-state letter that warned Fortune 100 companies about DEI practices setting up racial preferences in hiring, promotions, and other decisions. “As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, both our Constitution and our civil rights laws guarantee every American the right to be free from racial discrimination,” Skrmetti said in a press release. “The court’s reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin,” he said. “Corporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

The bitcoin price has more than doubled over the last year, pushed higher by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto—with a surprise BlackRock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) price shock just around the corner. Now, as fears are swirling the U.S. dollar is on "the verge of a total collapse," BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (Buidl) is being used to back a new stablecoin, described as a "key milestone" in the "$16 trillion by 2030" race to tokenize finance. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has helped spark a crypto revolution on Wall Street with his ... [+] embrace of bitcoin—pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher. Crypto company Ethena, which earlier this year launched a so-called synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDe that's swelled to a $2.6 billion circulating supply, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will invest its reserves in BlackRock's Buidl via real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize. "UStb will be fully backed by Blackrock Buidl in partnership with Securitize, enabling a separate fiat stablecoin product alongside USDe," Ethena﻿'s official X account posted. "As the largest tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund with over $522 million in assets, Buidl provides UStb with a secure foundation," Securitize's account posted. "This collaboration represents a key milestone in the evolution of tokenized finance, bringing together leading innovations in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization." In May, BlackRock led a $47 million strategic investment in its Buidl partner Securitize, widely seen as a long-term bet on crypto, with the fund allowing investors within crypto ecosystems to earn dividends on the Treasury fund while keeping assets on-chain. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, helped by BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto. Fink revealed last year that he believes the tokenization of assets on blockchains will drive a "revolution" on Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenized. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune in May. "Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy." Earlier this month, a report from crypto company Chainlink found the current value of tokenized assets is almost $120 billion, with ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, holding 58% of all tokenized assets. In 2022, Boston Consulting Group found "the total size of illiquid asset tokenization globally would be $16 trillion by 2030," while in 2021, the World Economic Forum estimated that "$867 trillion of value is ready to be disrupted by tokenization."

Title: ‘This is the last Bitcoin halving that matters’ – Exec

Here’s why this crypto VC founder believes this might be last important BTC halving. Previous Bitcoin halving cycles have been followed by BTC’s price rallying explosively. This phenomenon has made most cycle analysts and the overall market expect a parabolic price rally after every event. According to a recent Blackrock report, BTC’s value has risen by 592x since its debut in 2009. Subsequent exponential returns were recorded after each of the past three halving events too. In 2013, for instance, BTC saw 555x returns, while in 2017, investors saw 104x gains. After the 2020 halving, it posted another 21x returns. And, the trend is expected to repeat after 2024’s event. Source: BlackRock However, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto VC firm Capriole Investments, believes this might be the last halving event that drives a parabolic BTC rally. He said, “This is the last Halving cycle that matters.” Edwards argued that the next halving cycle won’t impact BTC because it’s already the hardest asset, with a very low inflation rate below gold. “The next halving won’t matter much because the inflation rate of BTC is below gold. So, a massive price drop won’t affect it much.” Edwards acknowledged though that the current cycle is not yet priced amid potential nation-state adoption. However, he noted that the halving cycles will be irrelevant by 2028. “You’re not going to get massive price rallies because the halving events are so well known, and the BTC mining industry is so efficient now. I think the 4-year halving cycles will not be relevant in four years.” Here, it’s worth noting that market cycle analyst Stockmoney Lizards projected a possible price target of $200k—$260k per BTC for this cycle top. This could happen by Q4 2025. Source: X In short, there is still more room for BTC growth before it hit this cycle top. The world’s largest digital asset retested $66k on Friday and was valued at $65.9k at press time. That puts it only 8% away from its range-high at $71k.

U.Today - Michael Saylor, Bitcoin permabull and the co-founder of MicroStrategy juggernaut that stacks BTC, has published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin’s high performance, which has massively surpassed that of leading assets in conventional financial markets. Over the past few days, digital gold has demonstrated an increase of more than 5%, reclaiming the $66,000 price mark. As of September this year, BTC shows annual gains of 51%. The second largest after it comes the Magnificent 7 stocks index (which includes such monsters as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) with 27%, followed by S&P 500 (14% rise), real estate (10% increase) and gold (7%). As for the market of bonds, it has entered the red zone, plunging by 4%. Highlighting Bitcoin’s success, Saylor tweeted, “Bitcoin is winning.” On Friday, Saylor reacted to Bitcoin recapturing $66,000 by publishing a tweet saying “Bitcoin is Storm-Proof.” He also responded to a tweet by a renowned investor Raoul Pal after Pal stated that his core crypto bets include SOL and DOGE. Saylor stated that “Bitcoin misses” Pal, to which the investor replied that while he still believes in Bitcoin 1,000%, he looks for assets that can bring large profits quickly, even if high risks are involved. Since Wednesday last week, Bitcoin has added more than 10%, soaring from $59,410 after the Fed Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut first time in the last four years. This was the initial driver of the Bitcoin price, followed by a similar announcement by the Central Bank of China and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) purchasing a mammoth amount of Bitcoin this week. In the past four days, its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has seen consecutive inflows of $388.19 million in total. This article was originally published on U.Today

Wokeness is stuff that most Americans of all races and genders can't stand. If they ate this stuff up, Disney—which has been indoctrinating children in gender fluidity through its programming—wouldn't have a stock price that hasn't moved in eight years. Bud Light would still be the nation's No 1. beer, not No. 3, after featuring a trans woman activist in a commercial. BlackRock would be advertising its fealty to Environmental, Social, and Governance investing instead of running away from it. I would like to credit the conservative media with these wins. But a closer look at what is still a modest unwinding of woke—a sometimes overused term, but one that still so perfectly describes the progressive groupthink that seeks to remake the country and its culture into a left-wing hellhole—shows it has more to do with deep reporting by individual reporters (e.g., Chris Rufo), viral social-media moments, and everyday Americans simply exposing the perniciousness and idiocy of this ideology. The conservative media—on this issue and many others—is a little more than an opinion-generating machine, and all too often a negative feedback loop. It leaves the reporting to last and misses an opportunity to have the impact that the mainstream media still does in driving the political and cultural conversation. This may be a harsh conclusion, but it's the reason why I wanted to subject the subject to journalism in my latest book, Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. I hate the label "mainstream media," but for lack of a better word, this is a world I've occupied, working on the news side of the Wall Street Journal covering financial scandal, Newsweek when it was a major print magazine, at CNBC, where I covered the financial crisis and broke most of the major stories at that time. I've been at Fox and Fox Business with a regular column in the New York Post for the past 14 years. Some would call those outlets "conservative media," yet I never changed the way I do my job, nor do my supervisors want me to. I've written and reported all my books the same way, whether it's exposing Wall Street scams, insider trading, the roots and impact of the 2008 collapse, or how progressivism has become an integral and insidious part of corporate American culture. I engage subjects. I check facts. I question my underlying thesis throughout my reporting. I try to be fair to people I'm reporting on. My journalism moves stocks and has changed corporate behavior. In that spirit, I spent a lot of time speaking with someone at the center of corporate wokeness, a man named Larry Fink, the CEO and founder of BlackRock. Fink is maybe the most powerful financier in America given Blackrock's size: It controls more than $10 trillion in assets. That means from his office in New York City, Fink holds stocks in the world's biggest companies, currencies of every industrial power, stocks, crypto, you name it. He's also used his power to spread corporate wokeness through ESG techniques, and in the process has become a target of the conservative movement, so much so, he has backed off his allegiance to the investing technique. Why Fink initially wanted to change boardroom behavior to scale back oil drilling, proceeded to expand DEI, then reverted is a great story. To his credit, he came clean, and it makes for a fascinating read. I'm probably the only reporter who got Fink to fess up about why he went woke in the first place. Based on reader responses, my book is more compelling because of it. I did what good reporters do—I got inside the head of my subject and, in this case, explained how the most powerful man in finance arrived at the place where he shouldn't have been. But this publication's reviewer, Paul Tice, thinks this is an example of some sort of malfeasance ("Woke CEOs and the Financial Fear Factor," September 15, 2024). He accused me of using "kid glove treatment on Wall Street." I was blown away by that characterization. So was Fink, doubtlessly. (I'm told he doesn't share that view of the book's treatment of him. So too presumably was the reviewer for the Wall Street Journal, who writes, "Mr. Gasparino gives us entertaining (and informative) accounts of corporate blunders in the name of wokeness. ... Among the villains trying to ram ESG down our throats are Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock; Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase; David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs..." I don't know Mr. Tice, but I can use that invention called The Google, and here's what I found. He's a longtime Wall Street money manager. In 2009, BlackRock—yes Larry Fink's BlackRock—purchased the hedge fund he worked at. Mr. Tice remained at BlackRock until 2015. The head of the hedge fund that BlackRock purchased, Rick Rieder, stayed and is now one of the most powerful people at the firm as head of fixed income. Mr. Tice is now a critic of ESG, which is great, but his background of working at BlackRock, not for a minute, but for six years in a senior capacity, and maybe the circumstances of his departure, should have been disclosed to readers. It wasn't. He was merely described as a member of a think tank who teaches at New York University and wrote a book on ESG. Not a word about working at BlackRock and his experience working for Larry Fink. Yes, good journalism is not only about reporting, but also adding essential context. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business Network senior correspondent, New York Post columnist, and author of Go Woke, Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. Paul Tice responds: Rather than questioning my motives and qualifications for reviewing his new book, Charles Gasparino should address the substance of my criticism. In his book, Gasparino tries to make the case that Wall Street has embraced sustainability because ESG has made firms like BlackRock "uber-wealthy," even though such an argument directly contradicts the premise of his work. As his Go Woke, Go Broke title clearly states, companies that follow progressive environmental and social policies don't outperform financially and often destroy enterprise value, which necessarily means that investment firms cannot achieve better portfolio returns by pursuing ESG investment strategies. Gasparino never acknowledges this core cognitive dissonance in his book. In trying to make the case, moreover, that ESG has been a huge "moneymaker" for BlackRock—thereby causing every Wall Street competitor to follow suit—he fails to back up his argument with facts. While Gasparino correctly notes that funds carrying a sustainable label can charge higher fees, he ignores the reality that, despite all the hype, ESG funds still comprise a very small minority of assets under management (AUM) across the industry. At BlackRock, sustainable funds (excluding cash management accounts) equated to just 6 percent of total AUM at year-end 2023, with more than half of these comprised of passive ESG funds with skinnier fee structures. Nonetheless, Gasparino credits almost all the rise in BlackRock's share price over the past two decades to the firm's strategic focus on sustainability. As he writes, "It is no accident that BlackRock's stock price appreciated more than 500 percent since it offered its first ESG fund [in 2005], compared to a 272 percent rise in the S&P." Given BlackRock's transformational acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 and the protracted zero-interest rate market environment throughout the 2010s, this is a ludicrous statement. It should come as no surprise that a stock like BlackRock's with a beta well above 1.0 would significantly outperform the overall market during an extended bull run. Gasparino also attributes the sharp swing in BlackRock's AUM over 2022-2023 to changes in its public ESG stance, even though the firm's $1.5 trillion AUM round-trip over these two volatile years was entirely owing to moves in the financial markets. In 2022, when "the stench of ESG … turned off many customers" according to Gasparino, BlackRock still had $307 billion of net fund inflows, dwarfing the roughly $4 billion of capital that was publicly pulled by nine disgruntled red states that year. In 2023, Gasparino asserts that BlackRock's "assets began returning as it moved away from ESG messaging," even though no investment money had left the prior year because of ESG. Lastly, Gasparino tries to explain BlackRock's sustainability focus by highlighting the pressure placed on the firm by blue state pension fund clients such as the retirement accounts run by New York City Comptroller (and now Democratic mayoral candidate) Brad Lander. While it is true that BlackRock manages money for several progressively minded investors, Gasparino steps on his own line by using bad numbers to embellish the point. Contrary to Gasparino's claim, Lander does not play "a leading role in managing more than $20 trillion in pension money." The actual figure is $264 billion as of year-end 2023, so Gasparino is off by a factor of 75. The above nuggets provide context for my contention that Gasparino bends over backward in his book to rationalize the ESG behavior of Wall Street firms, although I was being kind when I described his analysis as hyperbole. But what do I know? I only worked in the financial industry for 40 years. I am no match for the journalism and reporting skills of Charles Gasparino.

Acclaimed anime-style 3D RPG Punishing: Gray Raven is joining forces with another anime blockbuster this month with the massive Blazing Simulacrum patch. It’s a match made in neon heaven. BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER is a A-Rank Attacker Omniframe, which makes her obtainable within 10 pulls. Even you are a new player, it’s quite easy for you to get this character. The battle design highlights the coolness of “BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER,” staying true to the original character’s image. With a cold expression and a blue flame blazing in his left eye, She wields the powerful “Bladed Cannon” with her right arm. Her left arm bears a “Black Blade” that extends to a sharp point, concealing a deadly threat. This combination creates a vibrant “black” appearance, showcasing the allure of a real attacker. With the release of this new character comes her exclusive weapon, ★Rock Cannon. She will also feature an exclusive coating called Elder Flame, which perfectly aligns with her style and expresses her ambition to battle and win. The new patch story will take place in a limited-time world where BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER will meet her fateful enemy, “Dead Master,” and continue their destined battle. Four SFX coatings to collect, including two that nobody has seen before: Nightbreaker for Lucia: Crimson Weave and Snowbreak Bloom for Liv: Luminance. While Solitary Dream for Bianca: Stigmata and Vox Solaris for Selene Capriccio will have a rerun. There’s a new Chessboard Realms mode, too, allowing you to see what happens when you let a deadly killer loose on a chessboard. The game takes place in a world in which an army of deranged cyborgs, infected with a biomechanical virus called The Punishing, have driven human beings to the point of extinction and ousted them from planet earth. The survivors are eking out a miserable existence aboard the space station Babylonia while you, the commandant, assemble a crack army in preparation for a make-or-break counterattack. Download Punishing: Gray Raven to get started.

There might only be two teams unbeaten after two rounds of the Energia AIL Division 1A come teatime this afternoon, namely the winners of the Clontarf-Garryowen and Young Munster-Terenure matches. All victorious on the opening day, Terenure will seek to back up their victory at home over the champions Cork Con when they travel to Young Munster, who themselves won away to UCD. However, Terenure last won at Tom Clifford Park in February 2017, and they travel without last week’s match-winner Fintan Gunne, due to his Leinster call-up, and also their go-to centre Peter Sylvester, who played his 50th AIL game for the club last week before moving to Miami. The experienced Alan Bennie and pacy Conor Phillips start, with Craig Adams shifting to midfield alongside Aran Egan, as the former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave is tried at 10. It’s a potent looking backline, if lacking Sylvester’s physicality. The fit-again Jordan Coughlan returns in a strong bench. Similarly, Young Munster are without last week’s double try-scorer, Shay McCarthy, as he is with Munster in Parma, injured fullback Patrick Buckley and suspended tighthead Paul Allen. Shane O’Leary, Jack Shaw and Peter Meyer come in. As Bryan Fitzgerald is also on Munster duty, Garryowen bring Jack Delaney into midfield in one of four changes for their trek to Castle Avenue, with fullback Jamie Heuston, winger Colm Quilligan and lock Oisin Cooke starting. With Aitzol King called up to the Leinster squad, Clontarf have brought in Sean Reilly, Victor Allen and Peter Maher, as Andrew Smith shifts to fullback behind an unchanged pack and halves. The other opening day winners, Ballynahinch, travel to Temple Hill where Con have brought in centre Eoghan Smith and the Munster loosehead Mark Donnelly. Lansdowne, at home to UCD, recall winger Cathal Eddy and promote flanker Paul Wilson, the Gonzaga captain in their Schools Cup win two seasons ago. The students’ suffered injuries to both scrumhalves, Rob Gilsenan and Michael Moloney, and flanker Mark Hernan. They make eight changes and two positional switches, as Bobby Sheehan moves from hooker to blindside. St Mary’s make four changes for their trip to Armagh, with Ethan Baxter replacing suspended captain Ronan Waters after his red card against Clontarf. In 1B last week’s five home winners are all on the road against sides who lost away. Nenagh Ormond travel to Blackrock while Shannon and Old Wesley, each beaten in the semi-finals last season, meet in a reprise of the promotion final two seasons ago which Shannon won, and UCC host Highfield in a Cork derby. Two of last week’s winners in 2A meet when Corinthians host Greystones. The promoted Galway club won 27-10 away to Ballynahinch last week with a pack whose oldest player is 24 and a backline, featuring double-try scoring 19-year-old Tomás Farthing, whose oldest player is 21. Free-scoring Instonians host Ballymena in their first home game in 2A for 12 years and Navan begin their centenary celebrations in earnest when hosting Old Crescent, while in 2C Sydney Parade hosts its first AIL game in 22 years when Monkstown entertain Bruff. Division 1A: City of Armagh v St. Mary’s College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Garryowen, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v UCD, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: ‘Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger’ – Railway Union’s Niamh Byrne determined to go one step further than last year

Photo: Seb Daly/Sportsfile Niamh Byrne and her Railway Union team-mates have a big incentive to go all the way in the AIL this year, having lost last year’s final to UL Bohs. Moving on wasn’t easy, but in time they came to appreciate what was a ground-breaking day for women’s rugby. It was the first time the AIL final was held in the Aviva Stadium, having previously taken place in Donnybrook, going ahead in conjunction with the men’s decider as a double-header. Byrne, the Railway Union captain and former Ireland sevens and Leinster player, says the landmark occasion is a testament to the progress being made in women’s club rugby. “The day itself was absolutely wonderful,” she says. “The first time the women got to play the AIL final at the Aviva and the first time it was a double-header with the men. “It was great to play a part in that. The weather was unbelievable, leading to a really great atmosphere. Getting the bus in, the whole works, it all made for a brilliant experience.” The game more than lived up to the occasion, producing 13 tries as UL Bohs edged the Sandymount club 48-38 in a rip-roaring thriller. The new season begins this weekend and Railway Union are eager to get off to a winning start in their clash with local rivals Old Belvedere. “We’ve a lot of new girls down, with a lot of the team returning from last year, too. We’ve worked hard in pre-season, in the gym and on the pitch. “Unfortunately for us, we didn’t get the win last year and that was tough to take, but in time, you look back and say it really was such a great day out, a great spectacle, and a brilliant showcase of the standard of women’s club rugby in Ireland.” On the ground, increasing numbers at underage level is a sign of positive momentum in the women’s club rugby scene. The make-up of the Railway Union squad is emblematic of the growth, where a number of 18-year-olds are taking their first steps in senior rugby, guided by more experienced team-mates, such as Irish rugby legend Lindsay Peat, still going strong at 43. Byrne is somewhere in the middle, having begun playing as a youngster in Mullingar. “Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger,” says the centre. “Underage structures are improving. “There are under-18s ready to come in which there wouldn’t have always been, and a lot of those girls make that jump to senior rugby, and we’ll always welcome them,” she stresses. “The boys in my class in Mullingar set up the girls' underage team. We were all dragged down the first night, had no intention of playing rugby, I used to swim and play hockey. “After a few sessions, I decided rugby was for me. [I] played Leinster underage and senior and was contracted to the sevens after college.” Byrne would encourage anyone to come down to the club and get involved, and now her focus is on regaining the crown they last won in 2022. Blackrock, Old Belvedere and last year’s champs UL Bohs look to be Railway Union’s main rivals again – no team outside of those four have won a title in the last 20 years – and Byrne is excited to renew acquaintances. “Two of those rivals are obviously very close neighbours to the Railway team [Blackrock and Old Belvedere], so you go into those games knowing it’s going to be a very physical game. “There’s a lot of work to be done between now and April, but the goal of every season is to win it. “Last year was great, but the result does stick in the mind and we want to make up for that.”

Title: Assets in actively managed ETFs top $1 trillion worldwide

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Assets in actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide hit a record $1 trillion at the end of August, according to data provider ETFGI, boosted by easier regulations and a wave of product innovation. Active ETFs seek to outperform the indexes they are benchmarked to, including the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Bear Stearns launched the first active ETF in 2008. While they make up just 7% of all global ETFs, active ETFs have accounted for 30% of all inflows into the funds as a whole for the last several years, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street (NYSE:STT) Research, told Reuters in the latest episode of Inside ETFs. A key growth catalyst, analysts said, was the 2019 regulation popularly known as the “ETF rule,” which streamlined the complex process of winning approval for active ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Assets in the active ETF category have grown about 10-fold since 2019, according to data from ETF.com. Growth has continued this year. As of Aug. 31, active ETF assets soared 42%, data from ETFGI showed. The more relaxed regulations have also fueled innovation, Bartolini said, encouraging issuers to take novel approaches to products as they vie for investor dollars. Active ETFs run the gamut from the plain vanilla, such as the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Large Cap Value ETF to more niche offerings, like the AdvisorShares Vice ETF, which invests in shares of companies involved in the alcohol, tobacco and cannabis industries. "These regulatory rule changes have actually accelerated some of the more novel approaches that ETF issuers can bring to the marketplace," Bartolini said. Active ETFs include products that have been wildly volatile, such as Ark Innovation ETF, which soared 152% in 2020, only to slump 23% the following year. So far in 2024, it has lost 9.74%, compared with a 20% gain in the S&P 500. Some can also magnify risk, such as leveraged ETFs tied to the performance of individual stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nor are all active ETF issuers faring well. The 10 largest issuers accounted for 75% of active ETF assets, according to a Morningstar report from earlier this year. The bottom half of active equity ETFs have only 3% of all the group's assets. "ETFs that repackage old-fashioned stock-picking have struggled to attract assets," said Jack Shannon, manager research analyst at Morningstar, in a report published on Tuesday. Tim Huver, senior vice president of ETF Servicing at Brown Brothers Harriman, said active ETFs may require investors to do more due diligence. Nonetheless, he believes the category has reached a turning point. A Brown Brothers survey found that more than 90% of ETF investors intended to increase their allocation to active ETFs, Huver said. "I think the second trillion is going to arrive much more rapidly than it took us to get to the first trillion," Huver said.

Title: Report: Connected TV Ad Platform MNTN Considering Early 2025 IPO

Connected TV advertising platform MNTN is reportedly considering going public in early 2025. The firm, whose chief creative officer is actor Ryan Reynolds, selected Morgan Stanley to work on its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Friday (Sept. 27), citing unnamed sources. Deliberations around the IPO are ongoing, and details could change, according to the report. MNTN did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s advertising software includes targeting, measurement and automated optimization technology designed to help brands promote themselves on connected TVs, according to the report. In 2021, MNTN acquired Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort, and raised $119 million in a Series D financing round, per the report. The company’s Series D round closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was announced by the firm in a February 2022 press release. The round was co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management and Research Co. MNTN said in the release that the number of viewers making streaming their preferred way of watching television had exploded, that large advertisers were moving to connected TV because of this growth in consumption, and that MNTN’s software enables advertisers to buy connected TV inventory and measure its performance in real time. Patrick Pohlen, chief financial officer at MNTN, said in the release: “I’ve worked in venture and technology for over 25 years but this company and our new partners are special. Connected TV is transforming the advertising landscape and MNTN is leading the charge.” In a blog post announcing MNTN’s acquisition of Maximum Effort, MNTN CEO Mark Douglas and Reynolds wrote that the combination brought together tech and creative to simplify and accelerate advertising. “We believe the meteoric rise of Connected TV presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring media and creative closer together,” they wrote. “The demand for easy-to-use tech and superb, fast-turn creative is certain to climb thanks to an increase in inventory and advertisers new to TV — many of whom can’t afford upfronts. Independently, our companies have embraced and excelled because of our commitment to simplicity and speed. Together, we think the opportunities are endless.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock Buys Massive Amount of Bitcoin

U.Today - As recently reported by Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - the giant hedge fund with over $10 trillion in assets under management - bought more Bitcoin (BTC) this week than any ETF issuer has sold in the past three weeks. The purchases were made for BlackRock's own IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF and totaled the equivalent of $388.19 million over the past four days. As of today, the hedge fund's total cryptocurrency holdings amount to 362,193 BTC, or the equivalent of $23.79 billion. For comparison, this is over 100,000 BTC more than the amount held by the nearest competitor, Grayscale. There is no mystery behind such groundbreaking activity from BlackRock's side toward the major cryptocurrency. As the fund's head of digital assets recently revealed, for them, Bitcoin is not a risky gamble, but rather a scarce, global, decentralized, nonsovereign asset that has no country risk and no traditional counterparty risk. From the perspective of a $10 trillion asset management firm, BTC is more like digital gold than a beta to the NASDAQ and tech stocks in general. BlackRock's interest in cryptocurrencies does not end there, however, as the fund recently launched its spot Ethereum ETF solution. These ETFs have not seen the same hype as those focused on Bitcoin, but the number of ETH in BlackRock's wallet is growing regardless. It remains to be seen if we will see the appropriate level of acceptance for Ethereum from the financial giant, but at least the trend seems to be there.

Title: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman branded "podcasting bro" for his reportedly absurd plan to "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers" to fulfill his ambitious AI vision

Lack of sufficient computing power and AI chips limits AI advances, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly has an "audacious plan" to bypass these issues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. While Generative AI allows significant tech corporations like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google to tap into new and unexplored opportunities, it demands a ridiculous computing power and cooling water. Reports indicate that the world could be on the brink of the most significant technological breakthrough with AI, but there won't be enough electricity to power its advances by 2025. Google and Microsoft consume more electricity than 100 countries to power their AI advances. Last year, we learned that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT use up to 1 bottle of water for cooling per query. Recent research by the University of California further built on this premise, revealing that OpenAI's GPT-4 model (often considered mildly embarrassing at best) consumes up to three water bottles to generate a mere 100 words. OpenAI and Microsoft have openly highlighted their plans to address some of the issues preventing further advancement in AI, including investing $100 billion in a new project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overreliance on NVIDIA for AI chips. Microsoft recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams. Aside from looking at nuclear fusion as an alternative power source for AI advances, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly been curating an "audacious plan" to address the firm's computing power needs (via The New York Times). These plans are closely tied to investors in the United Arab Emirates and chip makers in Asia. According to sources with knowledge of Altman's ambitions, he reportedly pitched a multitrillion-dollar plan to investors, which would help build chip fabs and data centers worldwide. These plans would set OpenAI in a unique position to push its AI advances to the next level with unlimited computing power. As you may know, investors in the AI landscape recently raised concern over Microsoft's spending on AI efforts after its latest earnings call, citing difficulty in establishing a clear path to profitability in the category. Interesting;y, market analysts and experts claim OpenAI's reported bankruptcy claims in the next few months, with projections of $5 billion losses, are part of any startup's growing curve. With Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple lining up to participate in the ChatGPT maker's latest round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to over $150 billion, OpenAI could become the world's dominant AI company, given its unique enterprise and consumer position. As part of Sam Altman's plan to develop next-gen AI models, he'd require the United Arab Emirates to fund his ambitions by building multiple chip-making plants worldwide that cost up to $43 billion each. This plan would allow chipmakers like NVIDIA to meet the high demand for AI chips, especially in the Emirates, which has access to electrical power. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. To put Altman's plans into perspective, he told TSMC executives that it would "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision." According to a TMSC spokesman, the company is open to discussing expanding semiconductor development. However, it's more concerned about its current global expansion projects. TSMC execs reportedly found Altman's ambitions for AI absurd, branding him a "podcasting bro." An OpenAI spokesman responded to the claims that OpenAI pitches multi-trillion-dollar projects by refuting them and indicating that the firm isn't considering following that path for its AI ventures. What OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions," the spokesman added.

Title: Bitcoin climbs to $66,000, marking best September performance in history

The rally comes amid market optimism driven by the Fed's rate cut, economic stimulus in China and sustained demand from institutional players in the US. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Sept. 27 as New York opened for trading, reaching a two-month high to record its best September performance on record. The rally comes amid economic stimulus measures in China and the US Federal Reserve policy decision to cut interest rates, which have helped sustain recent market optimism. The surge is also driven by sustained institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin was trading at $66,200 as of press time after bears failed to pull the price back to lower levels immediately after the surge. However, the ensuing trading hours have seen subdued momentum, with a pullback to retest support at $65,000 likely in the coming hours. Institutional demand played a significant role in Bitcoin’s latest rally, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments recording significant increases in their holdings following the rate cuts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $365 million this week, the highest in over two months, indicating a sustained appetite from investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. The demand for Bitcoin ETFs has surged as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets amidst economic uncertainty. Many institutions are positioning themselves ahead of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts expected later this year. Several other institutional players have followed suit, with hedge funds and pension funds increasing their allocations to Bitcoin amid a broader search for yield and diversification. The appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value has strengthened as inflationary concerns grow and traditional assets such as bonds deliver lower returns. The upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price has also been supported by developments in China, where a wave of economic stimulus measures has boosted confidence in global markets. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, providing further momentum for Bitcoin’s rally. The digital asset has mirrored these gains, rising over 3% week-to-date, as capital flows from both institutional investors and favorable macroeconomic conditions continue to push its value higher. As traders speculate on the possibility of another Fed rate cut in November, optimism has grown across global markets, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs alongside Bitcoin’s rise. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool places the odds of another 50-basis-point cut at 52%, boosting hopes of further liquidity in the market. Lower interest rates are seen as favorable for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inject more liquidity into financial markets. With institutional demand remaining robust and macroeconomic conditions continuing to evolve in favor of risk assets, Bitcoin’s strong September performance could pave the way for further gains in October, a month historically positive for the crypto market. Analysts remain bullish, with some pointing to familiar patterns of strong price action following periods of institutional accumulation. As economic uncertainty persists and both central bank policies and global financial markets remain in flux, Bitcoin’s recent price movement highlights its evolving role as a key player in the financial landscape. At the time of press 6:32 pm UTC on Sep. 27, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.69% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.61 billion.

Title: Leaders That Mislead – Manipulators and the Manipulated

In modern times, governments joined at the hip with the ‘world order’ of mega-corporations and mega-banks have lost sight of what is actually needed for the wellbeing of the population. For decades, various ‘world order’ type policies emanating from the likes of the United Nations (UN) and the World Economic Forum (WEF); and debt-packages emanating from private international banking have been adopted by national governments Worldwide supposedly for the wellbeing of the populace. We are told this is to save us: However, these policies and economic ‘bailouts’ that were launched are more like chains around the neck, or ‘boats of stone’ that are slowly sinking, taking the general populace down with them. This is evident in policies that affect the lives of almost everyone on the planet. Policies that invariably mean you have to pay for the ‘fixing of the latest concocted problem’, via a new tax, a new regulation, or a change in your freedom or lifestyle. Take for example policies based on the bogus science of CO2-induced or methane-induced climate change; including the nonsense that dairy farmers must reduce cow numbers to combat climate change (i.e. reduce methane emissions). As more small farmers go bankrupt due to increased expense and regulation, mega-corporations buy more land and increase their control of the food system, unleashing more genetically-modified foods, while local farming, local resilience suffers. Who can forget the fake Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdowns and mass injurious vaccination that ensued, see also the book No Worries No Virus. Then there is the ongoing deceptive United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals involving Agenda 2030, which dictates how the entire world population should live their lives, and which ideologies they must accept. See also this article. There is also the fact that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) for solar and wind energy is too low to be viable in most locations and scenarios, and therefore to repurpose and rebuild the world energy and industrial system to de-carbonise the economy is a waste of vast amounts of fossils fuels (no wonder the sector seeks subsidies). Despite decades of government subsidies wind power provides less than 5% of the world’s energy, and solar just 1%. Another deception is in relation to electric cars, see also the article Electric Cars are Fake Environmentalism. Electric cars are still driven by electricity produced from fossil fuels and will most likely continue to be. The manufacture of potentially hundreds of millions of new electric cars and electric car batteries involves a continuation of widespread mining and processing of rare earth metals, such as lithium, rhodium and cobalt, which are a limited resource. The mining and processing of rare earth metals has been shown to be polluting to land, air, and water systems, such as rivers. Furthermore, there are even instances of electric cars going on fire and exploding, due to battery issues or short circuits, see these videos The Shocking Truth About EV Fires You Need to Know and How to Survive an Exploding Electric Car. Society has also experienced decades of economic trickery via debt money banking, as well as fake science or perverse ideology being taught in schools worldwide, etc. Europe and the western world has also been subject to decades of increasingly unvetted mass immigration, and masses of so-called asylum seekers being funded and planted into European countries from faraway countries where there is no war at all. What could possibly go wrong? See also this article describing the conflict Over Hundreds of ‘Unvetted Migrant’ Centres Being Planted Throughout Ireland and the UK. For more details on these hoaxes and deceptions see also the books available here on the Reality Distinguished From Illusion website. The boats of stones are built by ulteriors hidden from the public eye, and launched by unelected institutions such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. Then big-salaried national and international politicians (‘Yes’ men of the institutional moneyocracy) tell the public they must climb aboard the stone boats or drown. (Who can forget the Covid lockdown and vaccination mandates purported to save us all from impending death). Upon closer inspection, one can see that the underside of the boat is made of stone, however, hardly anyone wants to dive into the water and look underneath the boat, because everyone else is walking up the gangway, and a loudspeaker is blaring “Come aboard – get your free vaccination here, and we have great finance deals on new electric cars”. “Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction are in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those whose who blindly follow them… those who mislead people go to hell… humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone” – Ancient Vedic scripture (Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 7 Text 14, translated from Sanskrit by Srila Prabhupada) While the mega-corporate elites enact material or political power plays that advance their economic domination and political power, much of the general populace becomes more confused, weakened, poverty stricken, controlled or frustrated by endless regulations or government policies. Yet, many are, understandably, reluctant to jump off the boat, or do not know how to swim, i.e. few people know how to live independently of the government and corporate ‘system’. Thus, almost everyone is dependent on the increasingly authoritarian and restrictive government ‘system’ that has been imposed upon them. I spoke with a local farmer recently who tells me he spends so much time doing nonsensical paperwork and spending money to meet ridiculous regulations that the profession is hardly worth his time anymore, and none of sons would consider taking on such a time- and labour-intensive profession. However, not all the people are fooled or manipulated by the manipulators. Those with a stronger consciousness see through the lies. Nothing significant occurs by chance in a corporate-controlled world. Without money, planning and organisation, none of the above events would be possible. It is a question of power. There are those who manipulate to advance a certain agenda or self interest, and those who allow themselves to be manipulated. This is most effective when the targeted people are not aware they are being manipulated. Voluntary cogs in the machine are easier to deal with than forced ones. Who were the key players or misleaders that promoted the climate crisis hoax? My books CO2 Climate Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Real Environment Movement and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability delve into this topic, including the role of the private banking sector, President Obama, Al Gore, various institutions, and academics. Linked to this agenda are the deceptive UN Sustainable Development Goals. Also aligned with UN climate change agenda is the World Economic Forum ‘reset’ agenda that was officially launched in 2020. The WEF reset agenda has been sold as a solution to the fabricated problems of climate change and Covid-19. This is the Hegelian Dialectic tactic: fabricate a problem to be perceived, foster a public reaction, and then provide the solution. The solution is actually the implementation of original objectives that would have faced public resistance, but now the policy or agenda can be implemented publicly as the ‘solution’ to the ‘perceived problem’. Modern day governments subservient to mega-corporations and private mega-banks, rather than the people they are supposed to serve, have also become morally degraded. In modern times, the fabricated matrix of economy, government, banking and corporate power is a reflection of a dominator culture. The entire ‘mainstream reality’ is made up by the so-called elites who own or control the mega-corporate media, mega-banks, and the mega-corporate industry. Via government funded schooling, TV shows, and corporate control of mass media we have been indoctrinated into a type of corporate-communist-consumer culture. We are meant to become dependent on the system, via the work treadmill or social welfare, pay more taxes, and be shackled to debt, rather than become independently self-reliant in our communities and local regions. Self-reliant communities are a threat to the control culture of the socalled ‘powers that be’. Furthermore, we have been trained into accepting that certain aspects of our society are untouchable truths that should not be debated. Life is focused around the pursuit of illusions fed by bogus mantras, such as “we must reach net-zero by 2050”, or “becoming rich will bring you happiness”. The masses are compelled to enter the treadmill of the ‘rat race’ and wake, eat, work, sleep, repeat, die, without ever examining we are actually here on Earth, or what our true purpose in life actually is. Obedience to institutions and ideas, which are not at all what they seem, is ‘expected’. Being manipulated means that one is, unfortunately, part of the manipulation, having accepted that role within a contrived social construction without questioning it. A social construction that twists reality in order to twist you. When we try to change the current system for the better by forming adversarial political movements and seeking votes, however well-intentioned this may be, we are actually playing into a rigged game in which the money masters or so-called elites always win. This is because in current times the entire political democratic system itself is a sham, a sort of punch and judy show for the masses. Notwithstanding the various valid issues facing the populace, both the so-called left and so-called right of the political spectrum are also to a large extent manifestations of a divide and conquer strategy. When one follows the money one may see that both ‘sides’ are typically controlled, funded by, or beholden to, the same orthodoxy of money masters, private bankers, or financial elites that control the economy and the debt money system itself. In the U.S., this was exemplified when President Obama, a Democrat, administered over a massive bailout of private banks (read orchestrated muti-trillion transfer to private banks) in 2010; and then President Trump, a Republican, administered a multi-trillion bailout (wealth transfer to asset management corporation Blackrock) in 2020, under cover of a fake pandemic. In reality both are beholden to, not the voters, but to a private banking cabal. The books Demonic Economics and Transcending the Climate Change Deception also cover this topic. Furthermore, President Obama has been a champion of the Climate CO2 Hoax; and President Trump has been a champion and supporter of the Covid-19 vaccines, which have been injurious to many people. Injuries due to vaccination are documented in many articles including this article by Professor Michel Chossudovsky The Covid “Killer Vaccine”; and in my book No Worries No Virus. While politicians pay well scripted lip service to their respective voter bases with powerful scripted speeches and sound bites, the voters, understandably desperate for a hero, are led to believe if their party can just win the next election then everything will be change. Meanwhile, ‘behind the scenes’ ulteriors that have the actual political power implement their plans to shape society, regardless of which party gets elected. The elections are just window dressing, or a mirage of change. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/stocks-that-grew-more-than-bitcoin-8716756
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z
Full Content:
While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb upwards all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895 for the following months. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose 150%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $66K as it records its best September in history
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-september-rally-surges/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:15:16Z
Full Content:
Share this article Bitcoin surged to $66k today, setting a fresh two-month high and marking its best performance ever in September. This rally comes as global economic factors and institutional demand combine to drive the token price upward. Bitcoin’s price increase mirrors the sharp rise in Chinese stocks, fueled by China’s recent economic stimulus measures. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, thanks to the stimulus, which also boosted BTC by 3% week-to-date. “This feels frighteningly familiar,” commented trading resource The Kobeissi Letter on the sudden market rise. In the US, the FED’s recent 50-basis-point rate cut, announced on September 18, provided further momentum. The S&P 500 has set repeated all-time highs following the announcement, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print for August met market expectations. The next Fed meeting in November could see another rate cut, with the odds of a 50-basis-point cut standing at 52% according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, further fueling market optimism. Institutional demand remains strong. BlackRock has purchased more Bitcoin this week than any ETF has sold in the past three weeks. Positive inflows continue across other institutions offering Bitcoin ETFs, with yesterday’s ETF inflows reaching $365 million—the highest in over two months. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will be released from jail today. With China printing money, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, and institutional interest at an all-time high, Bitcoin’s strong September could pave the way for continued bullish action in October, which has historically been the best month for Bitcoin.

Title: India Could Boost Its Refining Capacity by 800,000 Bpd by 2030

In the decade to fiscal year 2024, India’s refining capacity increased by 42 million tons to 257 million tons, or to 5.16 million bpd. Refiners boosted capacity to meet the growing domestic consumption, as exports remained range-bound at around 1.3 million bpd over the period, the rating agency said in a report. By the end of fiscal 2030, India is set to add up to 40 million tons, or over 800,000 bpd, to its refining capacity and push up the installed base capacity to 295 million tons, or 5.92 million bpd, according to Crisil Ratings. The rise in capacity would be necessary to address the expected growth in consumption as the current capacities are already being optimally utilized, Crisil Ratings noted. “Most of the capacity addition would be brownfield expansions to cater to demand for end products, thus lowering the project risks,” said Adds Joanne Gonsalves, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings. “Further, the sector benefits from its strategic importance to the government”. Over the past decade, India’s domestic consumption of petroleum products rose by 4% per year, with transport fuels, accounting for around 56% of consumption, growing by 4% each year, according to Crisil. “We expect overall petroleum product consumption to slightly moderate and register ~3% CAGR over the next six years, primarily due to slower growth of 2-3% in transport fuel consumption,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings. India will drive up to 35% of global energy demand growth over the next 20 years, petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said at the Gastech conference in Houston last week. “If you say that global demand is increasing by one percent, ours is increasing by three times that,” Puri said. “In the next two decades, 35% of the increase in global demand will come from India.” By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Pemex Oil Output Dips as Outgoing Mexican President Fails to Bolster State Giant Next Post WTI Houston Crude Prices Gain Prominence as U.S. Oil Exports Jump Charles is a writer for Oilprice.com More Info Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices Oil Net Short For First Time in History Africa’s Top Refinery Could Soon Upend Global Gasoline Markets Chinese Refineries Go Bankrupt Amid Plummeting Margins The Refining Supercycle Is Coming to an End ADVERTISEMENT Oil Prices Plunge on OPEC+ Production Cut Speculation The Harsh Reality of the Global Energy Transition European Oil Majors Are Set to Struggle as a Supply Glut Looms WTI Breaks Below $70 as Concerns Over Oil Demand Persist © OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

The milestone comes after the $9 trillion asset manager recently acquired another $35 million worth of Bitcoin and $6.4 million of Ethereum earlier this week. With the latest acquisition, the asset manager’s Ethereum reserves now stand at 350,000 ETH, worth around $989 million, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are managed primarily through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which allows institutional investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock's holdings now represent approximately 1.70% of the total available Bitcoin. BlackRock’s recent acquisitions have set it apart from other major asset managers, particularly Grayscale, which currently holds around 258,671 BTC valued at $16.45 billion. However, Grayscale continues to hold a stronger position in Ethereum, with over 2.104 million ETH valued at roughly $5.45 billion—more than five times that of BlackRock’s current Ethereum holdings. On Sept. 25, BlackRock saw a surge of $184.4 million in inflows into its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the highest single-day inflow of any fund during the month, according to Farside data. This influx came shortly after the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 50 basis points—a move that has been a focal point of the financial markets throughout 2024, potentially influencing crypto investment and sentiment. While BlackRock’s increased crypto investments signal growing institutional interest, some observers have raised questions about the physical custody of these assets. Rumors have circulated online alleging that Coinbase, the exchange serving as a custodian for BlackRock and several other Bitcoin ETF issuers, is not acquiring the actual Bitcoin requested by the funds but instead issuing "paper Bitcoin" or IOUs. Baldilocks here. Not sure what this is all about TBH. All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled onchain. Institutional clients have trade financing and OTC options before trades are settled onchain. This is the norm for all our institutional clients. All funds… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 14, 2024 To address these concerns, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to clarify that all transactions involving the ETF are settled on the blockchain. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas further confirmed that BlackRock maintains its own blockchain node and consolidates its Bitcoin balances nightly, which are then reported to Coinbase Prime.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows cross $365.7 mln – Did China help?

What is driving the recent surge in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin’s price? After facing weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are once again gaining momentum. Despite September’s bearish reputation for BTC, both the cryptocurrency and its associated ETFs have defied expectations with a trend reversal. As of the most recent data on the 26th of September, total inflows for all Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $365.7 million. Leading the charge was Ark’s ARKB with $113.8 million, followed by Blackrock’s IBT at $93.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded $74 million, while Bitwise’s BITB sits at $50.4 million. VanEck’s HODL, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin’s EZBC also contributed inflows of $22.1 million, $6.5 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Although two more smaller ETFs showed modest inflows below $5 million, the overall surge underscores the renewed investor confidence in BTC ETFs. Notably, on the 25th of September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, witnessed an extraordinary surge of $184.4 million in inflows for its spot Bitcoin ETF, making it the highest single-day inflow of the month for any fund. This spike comes amid growing market speculation, potentially influenced by developments in Asia. For those unaware, Chinese stocks rallied following reports that the Chinese government may inject up to ¥1 trillion($142 billion) into its major state banks, aimed at boosting an economy that has faced challenges recently. Earlier in the week, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) took easing measures by cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points and lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. These actions have seemingly fueled optimism, which may be playing a role in the inflows seen in global markets, including Bitcoin ETFs. Remarking on the matter, Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, said, Source: Ki Young Ju/X He further added, “The U.S. is regaining dominance in #Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand. Only known entities are included.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Meanwhile, on the price front, BTC’s price action has shown remarkable resilience. After struggling to break past the $60,000 barrier for days, the leading cryptocurrency surged, reaching $65,642. This marked a 2.89% gain in the last 24 hours. As the month draws to a close, Bitcoin has exhibited a strong bullish trend with an impressive monthly rise of 10.98%, signaling sustained upward momentum in the market.

"We now have a Labour government whose number one priority is wealth creation," U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive broadcast interview Thursday. "We are a Labour party that is proud to say we are pro business just as much as we are pro worker." In July, Starmer became the first leader from the center-left Labour party to win a U.K. national election since Tony Blair — ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Since being elected, he has said his top priority is economic stability. During his visit to New York City amid the United Nations General Assembly, Starmer met with business leaders including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Blackstone President Jonathan Gray. This week, Blackstone committed to investing $13 billion to build a data center in the northeast of England. The investment aims to create 4,000 jobs and lead to one of the largest data centers in Europe to power the surging demand for artificial intelligence. "It's a big signal of confidence," Starmer told Sorkin about the deal. "It's also in the northeast of England, which matters to us, because I want economic drive outside of London." Starmer said the industries in particular he's working to attract investment in include renewables, artificial intelligence and life sciences. This call for investment comes as the Labour government is getting ready to unveil its budget plan in October, while dealing with a stagnant economy. Starmer's government, in the early days of its tenure, flagged a £22 billion ($29 billion) financing shortfall after his administration performed an audit. Former Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, for the Conservative Party, in July wrote to Simon Case, the head of the British civil service, labeling Labour's claims about the public finances "deeply troubling." Starmer has, more recently, been accused of being too negative on the U.K economy, and Labour's plans to ax the U.K.'s non-dom tax regime has also been criticized. "We will stabilize the economy," said Starmer Thursday. "There are going to be more hard decisions to be made when it comes to the budget." Earlier this week, Starmer's plan to cut payments that offset fuel costs for pensioners was rejected by his own party in a symbolic vote at the Labour Party's Annual Conference. "No one wants to change the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. But by doing that, we stabilize the economy," Starmer told Sorkin. "We can commit to what we call the triple lock, which means that they get more money year-on-year." The U.K.'s "triple lock" is where the state pension rises each year by either 2.5%, the inflation rate, or earnings growth — whichever is highest. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record best day since July with $365 million inflow

Ark's ARKB ETF leads with $113.8 million inflow, marking a significant turnaround. On Sept. 26, Bitcoin ETFs recorded substantial inflows totaling $365.7 million, marking the highest single-day inflow since July 22, when $530 million entered the market. According to Farside data, Ark’s ARKB ETF led with $113.8 million, marking a significant shift after recent outflows seen earlier this month. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF added $93.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC ETF reported inflows of $74 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF also saw strong participation with $50.4 million, and VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $22.1 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC reported smaller additions of $6.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued its trend of outflows, losing $7.7 million, while its smaller BTC ETF gained $2.9 million. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows of $0.1 million, continuing the recent trend of mixed investor sentiment in the Ethereum space. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw the most significant movement with outflows of $36 million, contrasting with BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $15.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Inflows were also recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW, Invesco’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH, albeit in smaller amounts. Other funds, including those from VanEck and Franklin, remained relatively flat. The contrasting flows highlight evolving trends. Bitcoin ETFs attract substantial inflows across major funds, mainly driven by Ark and BlackRock, while Ethereum ETFs face continued outflows, primarily from Grayscale. The flows coincided with Bitcoin also breaking $65k for the first time since August. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: BlackRock Highlights Bitcoin’s Unique Properties as Approved IBIT Options Could Cement Risk-Off Status
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/blackrock-highlights-bitcoins-unique-properties-believes-btc-is-risk-off-in-the-long-term/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T09:51:00Z
Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock released a report last week, titled "bitcoin as a unique diversifier." The investment giant identified four key points from the report. First, how to analyze bitcoin (BTC) in relation to traditional financial assets due to its fundamental properties, such as not having a quarterly earnings report or a CEO. Second, bitcoin's high volatility can be perceived as a "risky" asset, which contributes to the discussion that whether it is a "risk-on" or "risk-off" asset. The token could be considered a flight-to-safety option because it is scarce, non-sovereign, and decentralized. Lastly, BlackRock pointed out that the long-term adoption of bitcoin may come from global instability. Bitcoin's realized volatility continues to trend downwards over time, indicating increased stability. In the early years of bitcoin, its realized volatility used to trade over 200%; however, as the asset matured, so did the volatility. Since 2018, realized volatility has not exceeded 100% and is currently at 50%. As realized volatility decreases and liquidity increases through financial instruments such as the spot and futures market, this may bring in more sophisticated investors such as options traders. This seems to be on the horizon with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock also asked the question: Is bitcoin risk-on or risk-off? While short-term trading may suggest that bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, the data reveals a different narrative over a longer time horizon. According to data from bitcoin custody service Unchained, "almost all holders (99%+) are in profit if they held for just three years. All bitcoin holders in this class are in profit if they held for at least 5 years". We can see this type of mentality on-chain among investors, where over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for more than one year, according to Glassnode. This trend suggests that many investors tend to hold bitcoin because they believe in its store-of-value narrative and view it as a risk-off asset, even though bitcoin has faced multiple 20% corrections in 2024. BlackRock also showed that bitcoin has a very low correlation to U.S. equities. A graph shows the trailing 6-month S&P 500 correlation with bitcoin; the average correlation is 0.2 since 2015. Sometimes, assets will trade near one-to-one with one another due to external macro factors, most likely in risk-off or liquidity events. The report notes, "These episodes have been short-term in nature and have failed to produce a clear long-term statistically significant correlation relationship." Continuing with the theme of having a long-term time preference, BlackRock noted that bitcoin tends to outperform other risk-on assets after 60 days following a major geopolitical event. The U.S.- Iran escalation in 2020 saw bitcoin return 20% after 60 days, outperforming gold and S&P 500. This was also the case for Covid-19, the 2020 U.S. election challenges, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. regional banking crisis, and most recently, the Yen Carry trade unwind on Aug. 5. During the recent Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which was now 53 days ago, major assets experienced declines on the day. However, bitcoin has risen by 22% since then, with gold and the S&P 500 up roughly 11%. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Google to invest $3.3 billion building two data centers in South Carolina

Google has announced its plans to invest $3.3 billion in two new data centers in South Carolina. The news comes as rivals, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades for use in AI, as they provide the necessary computing power, data storage, and network connectivity, all essential for processing vast amounts of data efficiently. Out of the $3.3 billion, a significant portion of the investment, $2 billion, will be allocated for campuses at Pine Hill Business Campus in Ridgeville and Winding Woods Commerce Park in St. George. The other $1.3 billion would be used to expand Google's existing data center in Berkeley County and is expected to create 200 operational jobs in the region. Google is not the only big tech company that is expanding its data centers. Microsoft recently announced a massive $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure which includes building data centers, energy projects, and more, in partnership with BlackRock and an investment firm. Google is itself investing €1 billion (around $1.1 billion) in expanding its data center in Finland and $2 billion in an AI data center in Malaysia. Amazon is also investing $11 billion in new data centers in Indiana and even includes four solar farms and a wind farm, with a combined capacity of more than 600 MW for the data center's energy needs. Energy demand is likely to soar as big tech companies continue to build and expand energy-hungry data centers across the globe to meet their AI capabilities. However, they are likely to be run on green energy in the near future. A notable example is Microsoft's recent announcement to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The facility, infamous for a significant nuclear accident in 1979, will now supply 835 megawatts of power to support Microsoft's data centers, as the company aims to run all its data centers on clean energy by 2025.

Title: Is Satoshi Nakamoto’s position as top Bitcoin holder at risk?

Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings. Can it surpass Satoshi Nakamoto by year-end? After a period marked by minimal activity, BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has regained momentum, recording substantial inflows starting on the 23rd of September. Notably, on the 25th of September, IBIT saw an impressive influx of $184.4 million, while the total inflow across all Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $105.9 million. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually experiences outflows, reported zero movement on the same day. However, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark’s ARKB experienced outflows of $33.2 million and $47.4 million, respectively. This resurgence in ETF activity has propelled the U.S. BTC ETF to an astounding $17.944 billion in inflows for 2024, marking a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC—only about 84,000 BTC shy of the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. Seeing this impressive growth, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst took to X and noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is estimated to hold approximately 1.1 million BTC, a figure that institutional BTC ETFs are rapidly approaching. Recent data indicates that these ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings, and if the trend of increasing inflows continues, it could soon surpass him. Currently, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the list of the top Bitcoin holders, closely trailed by Binance with 673,783 BTC. Notably, major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale collectively hold a significant 901,101 BTC through their ETF products, with individual holdings of 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In contrast, the remaining five asset managers with BTC ETFs possess a combined total of just 14,946 BTC. Sharing a similar line of thought was Spencer Hakimian, Founder of Tolou Capital Management who said, “ETF’s going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas Day.” Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, ranks sixth with 252,220 BTC and is on a path to potentially join the top tier of Bitcoin holders. Thus, as BTC ETFs continue to capture attention, Bitcoin itself has seen a resurgence in price. After facing challenges in breaking through the $60,000 barrier, BTC was trading at $64,358, reflecting a modest increase of 0.91% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Rebound as BlackRock Acquires 2,913 Bitcoin (BTC)

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock made headlines by purchasing 2,913 Bitcoin, worth $184.3 million. This marked their highest single-day acquisition in September. The news shows a renewed demand for Bitcoin, especially in the exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market. With this purchase, BlackRock solidified its position as the leading Bitcoin holder, surpassing other firms. BlackRock’s latest acquisition represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The firm now holds a total of 359,279 BTC, valued at approximately $23 billion. This amount far exceeds holdings by other firms like MicroStrategy, which has 107,059 BTC less than BlackRock. This massive investment also signals a rebound in the Bitcoin ETF market. The U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs debuted in January, sparking a wave of demand. Bitcoin ETFs recorded a massive single-day inflow of $1.05 billion in March and a total net asset of $62.5 billion in June. However, the market saw a decline in demand during July. Interestingly, recent trends show that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have picked up again. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s $184.3 million Bitcoin Purchase contributed to $105.8 million in single-day inflows for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BIBT) experienced positive inflows that day. BIBT saw a net inflow of $2.07 million, while other funds like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) sold 525 BTC, worth $33.2 million. Also, the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) offloaded $47.41 million in Bitcoin. Other issuers, such as Grayscale, reported zero inflows. Amid these developments, an X user shared that the 30-day flow indicator for Bitcoin ETFs has turned positive. This is a welcome change after a period of negative trends, and it shows that issuers have seen an average net inflow over the past month. #Bitcoin spot ETF demand has rebounded, with the 30-day net change in total holdings turning positive. pic.twitter.com/c0C8BaFPDq — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) September 26, 2024 These funds have received new money for five days, totaling almost $500 million. Additionally, they have received more money in nine out of the last ten days. “The U.S. is regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand,” says Ki Young Ju. Historically, the U.S. has dominated Bitcoin holdings among public firms. The recent surge in inflows has helped restore that dominance, which had dipped due to previous lackluster performance. The renewed interest in the market is evident in BTC’s price. On September 25, Bitcoin declined to $62,700. However, after this BlackRock purchase, BTC’s price has now been around $64,000. Also, BTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA lines, suggesting a bullish sentiment. Looking at its chart, BTC is closer to breaking its primary resistance at $64,700. A cross above this level will boost the bullish momentum in the market. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) CEO Lisa Su Announces That Their Next Phase Would Not Be A Transition Away From GPUs But Rather A Broadening Beyond Them

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss. AI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds. Tom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. Lisa Su, the CEO of the firm, recently said that graphic processing units (GPUs) might not be the architecture of choice for companies working on AI within the next five years because they did not offer the level of programmability tech firms wanted. The CEO was contextualizing earlier statements in which she said that GPUs right now were the architecture of choice for large language models, because they were very efficient for parallel processing. Su further noted that the next phase would not be a transition away from GPUs but rather a broadening beyond them. Custom AI chips, tailored to company-specific AI tasks, are already gaining traction in the tech world, highlighting the broadening away from GPUs. Overall AMD ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
