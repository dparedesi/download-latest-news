The native token of the Telegram-affiliated The Open Network, the 18th largest crypto by market value, was trading at $3.37, CoinGecko data shows. TON soared to almost $3.70 and was up about 23% at one point earlier in the morning. Telegram’s fortunes, which have risen in recent months, continued to swing upward on Wednesday. The company is preparing to raise $1.5 billion in a corporate-bond sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the company's plans. The messaging platform will issue five-year bonds offering a 9% yield—a raise that has invited interest from Emirati-owned investment firm Mubadala, BlackRock, and hedge-fund manager Citadel, according to The Journal. Telegram has shared with investors that it clocked $540 million in profits on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024, people familiar with the matter told the publication—a major rebound from its lackluster performance the year prior. The app boasted one billion active users as of March 2025, according to Telegram's executives, and enrollment in its subscription services has roughly doubled over the past year or so. Separately, Telegram will deploy AI-powered chatbot Grok to its growing platform under the terms of a one-year agreement with Elon Musk's xAI, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said Wednesday in a social media post. Telegram will receive half of xAI's subscription sales made through the messaging platform, Durov tweeted. Later in the day, however, Musk pushed back on the announcement, replying on X hat "No deal has been signed." Durov replied, "True. Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending." The price of TON dipped following the exchange. Durov is still facing criminal charges in France related to alleged illegal activities hosted on Telegram, leaving the application's future somewhat uncertain. French authorities arrested Durov in August, alleging Telegram facilitated terrorism and drug trafficking enterprises, among other nefarious activities, on its platform. And earlier this month, authorities declined the founder's appeal to travel to the U.S. for "negotiations with investment funds,” POLITICO reported. Telegram created TON in 2018, but distanced itself from the network just two years later as it faced regulatory scrutiny over its role in the project. However, the messaging application began flirting with TON nearly two years later, hosting the TON Wallet App and tap-to-earn games in its application. The latter initiative helped TON garner widespread recognition last year, as viral tap-to-earn games such as Catizen and Hamster Kombat‌ amassed hundreds of millions of players on Telegram.

Title: TON jumps 16% as Telegram gets $300M plus xAI equity to integrate Grok

Telegram bags $300M in xAI deal as profits and bond bets reset trajectory. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Telegram is no longer just a privacy-first chat app for crypto bros. With a dramatic one-two punch, a $300 million alliance with Elon Musk’s xAI and a $1.5 billion high-yield bond raise, Telegram has moved from insurgent platform to profit engine. TON jumped 15% after Durov confirmed the collaboration. Yet its future, including IPO prospects, remains hostage to a legal tangle playing out in French courts. In a headline-grabbing move, Telegram announced an exclusive distribution agreement with xAI that will embed Grok, Musk’s LLM chatbot, into the platform for one year. The terms: xAI will pay $300 million in cash, as well as equity and 50% of all Grok-related subscription revenue generated through Telegram. “Together, we win ❤️📈🏆,” posted CEO Pavel Durov, celebrating what he framed as a platform-defining moment. The move marks Telegram’s first major monetisation of its 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs) – a sharp pivot from its historically donation- and debt-fuelled operations. Durov has insisted that Grok integration won’t compromise user data: “No Telegram data will be supplied for Grok training,” he wrote. The deal puts Telegram ahead of rivals like WhatsApp and Snapchat, who’ve struggled to extract revenue from AI features within messaging ecosystems. Telegram also disclosed its first-ever profit: $540 million in 2024, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This figure marks a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when the company operated at a steep loss. With 15 million paying users and organic growth of 2.5 million users per day, 2025 revenue is forecasted at $2 billion, with profit exceeding $700 million. For investors, the metrics finally validate Telegram’s long-gestating monetisation model. Along with announcing its AI deal, Telegram completed an oversubscribed $1.5 billion bond offering at a 9% yield, with major backers including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, according to WSJ. The five-year paper refinances debt from a 2021 convertible note and includes an IPO-linked conversion sweetener, an implicit bet that Telegram will go public before 2030. The bond’s success surprised some market watchers, especially given CEO Durov’s ongoing legal entanglements. But investors appear willing to price that risk as noise against Telegram’s unit economics and growth profile. Despite operational momentum, a significant cloud looms over Telegram’s prospects: founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 and subsequent indictment on 12 preliminary charges, including non-cooperation with child safety investigations. Durov remains under judicial supervision and is barred from leaving France. A May 12 court ruling blocked his planned trip to the U.S. to meet investors. “We complied with all the binding legal requests we received,” Durov told the WSJ. “Up until this day, we don’t understand what we did wrong.” The legal case could delay or derail IPO ambitions, raise governance concerns, and complicate global platform operations. It also emphasizes broader regulatory questions about the liabilities of end-to-end encrypted app providers. Is Telegram now on a glide path to IPO? Possibly, but not inevitably. The bond’s conversion feature suggests that at least the option remains alive. But some analysts argue the high-yield raise could be a bridge or even a hedge, a way to lock in growth without public-market scrutiny while Durov navigates his legal peril. The one-year Grok integration, too, carries open questions: Will AI subs stick? Can xAI deliver? Will regulators scrutinise the data layer despite Durov’s assurances? And if Musk stumbles, what becomes of the promised $300 million? Still, with its platform pivot, Telegram has shed the image of a burning-money outlier. Whether it becomes a public tech titan or a cautionary tale may depend as much on courtroom outcomes as on product-market fit. Telegram’s summer surge, marked by AI monetisation and a bold debt raise, signals a company evolving into a sustainable business. But Durov’s legal cloud may prove the ultimate variable in whether Telegram becomes the next great tech IPO or a cautionary tale of platform governance in the age of encryption.

Title: Blockchain oracle RedStone brings tokenized TradFi assets to Solana in partnership with Securitize
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/redstone-tokenized-tradfi-assets-solana/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T14:00:03Z
Full Content:
Share this article RedStone is launching its blockchain oracle services on Solana in partnership with Securitize, enabling access to tokenized traditional financial assets like US Treasuries and credit products, the company announced on Wednesday. The integration, powered by Wormhole Queries, is aimed at providing Solana builders with price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. Developers can now incorporate real-world assets (RWAs), such as Apollo’s $ACRED or BlackRock’s $BUIDL, into dApps. Discussing the launch, RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak said the development represents a foundational shift in how tokenized RWAs are utilized on Solana. Rather than serving solely as static, tokenized instruments, RWAs can now be actively composed within DeFi protocols, enabling practical use cases that bridge traditional financial products with on-chain systems. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said Kazmierczak in a statement. “It’s no longer just about tokenization — it’s about composability and unlocking use cases that merge traditional and onchain finance.” Securitize, which partners with major asset managers including Apollo, BlackRock, and VanEck, has chosen RedStone as the oracle provider for its tokenized products. The company said it has accumulated over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. “We’re seeing the walls come down between TradFi and DeFi,” said Securitize’s Head of Credit and DeFi, Reid Simon. “The next evolution is about giving global institutions the tools to transact seamlessly across chains.” RedStone’s collaboration with Securitize, announced in March, helps enhance the usability of Securitize’s tokenized funds across DeFi platforms. RedStone delivers price feeds for these assets, enabling their integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, with cross-chain capabilities on networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Earlier this month, RedStone’s $ACRED feed was successfully deployed in a Morpho vault on Polygon, one of the first live DeFi vaults to integrate a major RWA. The Solana expansion could enable similar products to reach a wider audience, from retail to institutional users. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Instant messaging app Telegram has signed a deal with Elon Musk's xAI to integrate the Grok AI service within the app. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, revealed on X, that the two companies agreed to a 1-year partnership that would see Telegram receive $300 million in cash and equity from xAI, in addition to 50% of revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram. "Together, we win!" Durov wrote. The deal comes as Telegram looks to raise $1.5 billion via a bond offering that is being backed by the likes of BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel. The proceeds of the raise will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021. The messaging giant has 1 billion customers and reported a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024. The TON token, the native token of the TON Network that was developed by Telegram, is now up by 18.5% over the past 24 hours after starting to surge two hours before the announcement was made. The move continued after the announcement, rising from $3.28 to $3.55.

Messaging platform Telegram is raising at least $1.5 billion through a new bond offering. The firm is raising the funds through a five-year bond with a 9% yield, which has drawn interest from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel, the Wall Street Journal reports citing sources with the deal. The proceeds will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021, due next March. The new bonds are convertible into equity at a discount if Telegram goes public. Telegram originally developed layer 1 network TON, before making it an independent operation. In April, tokenization firm Libre said it plans to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram debt on TON as Telegram Bond Fund (TBF).

Financially, the firm turned a corner in 2024, reporting a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue, up from a $173 million loss in 2023, the WSJ wrote. It projects a profit of more than $700 million for 2025. Telegram has grown its revenue by expanding its ad business and introducing features like in-app digital gifts and a platform for developers to build apps and bots.

Title: Telegram to raise $1.5B in bond sale, Citadel joins BlackRock in backing the deal: WSJ

Share this article Telegram, the popular messaging platform, is preparing to issue at least $1.5 billion in new bonds on Wednesday, having secured commitments from both new investors, including Citadel, and established bondholders such as BlackRock and Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported early Wednesday. The bond will have a 5-year term at a 9% yield, according to the report. Proceeds from the bond offering will be used to buy back Telegram’s 2021 bonds, which mature in March 2026. About $400 million of that earlier debt has already been repurchased. Investors will have the option to convert their debt into shares at a discount if Telegram pursues a public offering, though an IPO appears unlikely in the near term. The deal signals that investors remain confident in Telegram’s financial trajectory and user growth, despite legal uncertainty around its founder, Pavel Durov. Durov has faced preliminary charges in France for allegedly refusing to cooperate with investigations into illegal activity on the platform. After being detained and investigated in France last year, in March, Durov was granted permission by an investigating judge to temporarily leave France. In a statement post-return to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Telegram’s headquarters and operations are located, he stated that Telegram has not only met but also exceeded legal expectations in moderation, cooperation, and crime prevention. Ahead of the bond offering, Telegram reported a $540 million profit in 2024, according to the Financial Times, which cited a company presentation shared with potential investors. The profit marked a sharp turnaround from a $173 million loss the previous year, with revenue soaring to $1.4 billion, driven largely by premium subscriptions, advertising, and partnerships tied to the Ton blockchain ecosystem. The announcement sparked a rally in Toncoin (TON), the crypto asset tied to The Open Network, which climbed 6% to nearly $3.2 shortly after the news, according to CoinGecko data. TON has previously shown a quick reaction to developments involving Telegram and its CEO. Last August, the token plunged 18% following Durov’s arrest, only to rebound after his release. Also on Wednesday, the TON Foundation announced it had appointed former Visa executive Nikola Plecas as vice president of payments to lead its global payments strategy. Plecas will focus on enhancing payment capabilities within The Open Network (TON) and managing partnerships, particularly involving TON and Telegram, while also overseeing compliance.

Title: 2 trades BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder told us he's making to help generate almost 7% yield
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/highest-yields-fixed-income-bond-market-trades-investing-blackrock-rieder-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-28T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
It's been a particularly busy start to the year for BlackRock's bond chief, Rick Rieder — not that someone overseeing $3 trillion in assets has all that much spare time to begin with. The economic policy uncertainty that President Donald Trump has introduced has sent the bond market flailing in a way Rieder hasn't seen before. But the volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing. "There is change afoot. One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static," Rieder told Business Insider. "The reaction function to any piece of news can be really extreme," he added. "So markets go through these periods of illiquidity, and it just presents these great opportunities that, by the way, may only be there for 10 minutes, or an hour, or a day. But I've never seen markets move to such extremes." Rieder shared a few of those opportunities he's leaning into at the moment in his iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC), which yields 6.6% and has grown to $9 billion in assets since launching in May 2023. One of them is the front end of the yield curve, or short-duration Treasurys. Yields on the two-year note had dropped from 4.3% last year to 3.6% in April as investors started to price in as many as five rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But as rate-cut expectations have fallen, yields have risen back up to nearly 4%, making them more attractive. Front-end bonds also offer a hedge for economic volatility in the short term, allowing investors to clip a robust coupon without being locked in for too long. The long end of the curve, meanwhile, isn't acting as a recession hedge, Rieder said, with investors worried about inflation from tariffs and rising yields thanks to ballooning fiscal spending deficits. "I'd rather keep yield up and not have to worry about the volatility," Rieder said. "The long end is not a hedge," he added. "Its traditional offsetting risk function doesn't work today, and so until yields move significantly higher, I don't see any significant reason to own longer in interest rates." Long-end rates in Europe, however, are more attractive, Rieder said. He said he's betting on European B- and BB-rated high-yield bonds to deliver higher yields. This is because economic growth is slowing to a greater degree in Europe than in the US, and inflation is tamer, so the European Central Bank is likely to cut rates more aggressively. This has meant limited upside volatility for European rates. For example, while 10-year Treasury yields have surged from 3.99% to 4.43% since April 4, 10-year eurozone bond yields have been virtually flat, falling by just 3 basis points from 3.13% to 3.1%. When yields rise, bonds lose their value, and vice versa. "Taking some of your interest-rate risk in Europe versus the US — particularly versus long US — has been an exciting thing to be involved with," Rieder said. "Usually, US and European rates move together," he added. "Now you're seeing historic movements of European rates relative to the US, meaning European rates are much more stable." Plus, the dollar's weakness relative to the euro is icing on the cake. "Because of the cross-currency swap, you could buy Europe and you get a couple of percent of additional yield," Rieder said. To mitigate the downside risk of some of the higher-yield bonds in his portfolio, Rieder pairs them with high-quality assets like AAA collateralized loan obligations, he said.

Title: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has quietly funneled roughly $5 billion of its earnings into a mix of US businesses and government debt over the past two years. It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures. (That’s on top of having more than 120 billion in… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 26, 2025 Based on reports, Tether has also built positions in several US‐based Bitcoin mining firms. It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. With $153 billion in USDT out there—about 60% of the total stablecoin supply—Tether still leads globally. But in the US and Europe, USDT has seen some exchange delistings over MiCA compliance worries. A homegrown coin may smooth those relations. Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors. The company insists it works closely with law enforcement when criminal funds surface.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Wall Street rallies on Trump’s EU tariff delay

Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump’s trade policies whipped back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union. The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union’s chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. They more than recovered their losses from Friday, when Wall Street’s roller coaster dropped after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time. “We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.6% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs. On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market’s gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. It was the first increase in six months, and consumers’ expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board. On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. Informatica climbed 6% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.5%. They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, where 93% of the stocks within the S&P 500 rose. One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 3.7% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts’ expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer’s operations outside the United States. All told, the S&P 500 rose 118.72 points to 5,921.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 740.58 to 42,343.65, and the Nasdaq composite gained 461.96 to 19,199.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt. Yields had been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Wall Street rallied on Tuesday after President Trump delayed a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union. The S&P 500 rose 118.72 points, or 2%, to 5,921.54.

Title: $65,000,000,000 Pension Fund Issues Warning to US Money Managers, Says Industry Abandoning ‘Basic Principles of Stewardship’: Report

The $65 billion Dutch pension fund PME is reportedly warning US money managers not to abandon their “basic principles of stewardship” during the Trump era. According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: 2 reasons BlackRock sees upside ahead for one beaten-down corner of the stock market

US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space. First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever. "The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs," BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand." In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024. Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks. "Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth," BlackRock wrote. "Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think." BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth. "Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers," BlackRock wrote. "But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Enduring value: Traditional assets with modern strategy

Time Published: 2025-05-27T16:24:20Z

Dominic Kohler, head of investment and client solutions at Brown Shipley, a Quintet Private Bank, reflects on the resilience of traditional assets, equities and bonds, amid inflation, volatility, and a new generation of investor expectations. Marked by rapid macroeconomic shifts, traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income are being tested like never before. According to Kohler, the investment landscape is one of complexity and opportunity where prudence, adaptability, and trust are more valuable than ever. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more “We have been navigating a challenging environment over the past couple of years,” Kohler notes. “High interest rates, sustained inflationary pressure, volatile markets and continued geopolitical uncertainty” have reshaped how traditional assets are perceived and deployed. For equities, Kohler stresses, “being more selective; quality and resilience matter more than ever.” On the fixed income side, the outlook has brightened. “Things are looking up again now that yields are more attractive.” This combination of cautious optimism and tactical flexibility underscores Brown Shipley’s broader approach. “It’s a market where careful positioning is key – with a focus on the long term whilst also looking for opportunities as and when they present themselves.” Even as inflation shows signs of cooling, Kohler maintains that preserving wealth remains a core priority especially for private clients seeking long-term stability. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Apart from capital appreciation, our investment philosophy also includes a focus on wealth protection,” he explains. “Even with inflation starting to ease, this remains key. Quality shares and government or corporate bonds remain reliable tools to help us deliver on our philosophy.” While new asset classes and financial innovations continue to emerge, Kohler believes in the continued importance of traditional investments. “We are convinced that – even with changing market conditions, new asset classes and product innovation – traditional assets will continue to play a key role.” Brown Shipley employs a flexible yet disciplined approach to asset allocation, allowing it to respond quickly to market developments without losing sight of long-term objectives. “We have a dynamic asset allocation approach,” Kohler explains. “We actively adjust our positioning as the market changes, always guided by our long-term outlook but responsive to short-term shifts.” During periods of heightened volatility, this might involve reducing exposure to riskier assets like equities and increasing allocations to higher-quality bonds. “Within equities, we lean towards sectors and companies that are better positioned to weather uncertainty,” he adds. “On fixed income, with yields now more attractive, bonds have become an effective tool not only for capital preservation but also income generation.” While traditional assets form the core of most portfolios, Kohler highlights the growing relevance of alternatives in achieving true diversification. “It’s all about finding the right mix,” he says. “Alternatives can help reduce risk, increase diversification and provide an illiquidity premium.” Private markets, in particular, are gaining traction especially with younger, more growth-oriented investors. However, Kohler offers a word of caution. “Private markets are complex and often poorly understood. Clear communication and positioning of the benefits – and risks – is therefore important.” Despite the rise of alternatives and digital investments, Kohler remains confident in the long-term performance potential of traditional assets. “We are focused on providing consistent risk-adjusted returns over the long term,” he says. “Traditional assets still have a strong role to play. They can offer stability and consistency, particularly when clients see uncertainty and risk in the market.” Moreover, risk management is central to Brown Shipley’s investment philosophy. Through its parent company, Quintet, the bank partners with BlackRock to gain access to cutting-edge risk assessment tools. “As part of our partnership with BlackRock, we utilise best-in-class risk management tools to stress-test portfolios and consider various market scenarios,” Kohler explains. But numbers alone aren’t enough. “It is critical that advisers are close to clients and understand what is most important to them – spending time with them and ensuring their strategy remains aligned to their investment objectives and personal circumstances.” Where geopolitical developments can move markets overnight, Kohler’s advice is to remain level-headed. “Whether elections, conflicts or tariff announcements, we look at how such events may affect markets and adjust portfolios as required,” he says. “However, as we have seen at the start of this year, it is key to filter out the noise – whilst it is important to seek out opportunities, sometimes standing firm in our positioning can be the best course of action in the long run.” Looking ahead, Kohler sees several forces reshaping the future of traditional investing from regulatory shifts and product innovation to the expectations of younger investors. “We are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer in history,” he says. “Younger investors have an increased focus on thematic and sustainable investing. We are continuing to evolve our product offering accordingly, providing clients more choices about how their wealth is managed and invested.” Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly front and centre. But Brown Shipley’s approach is personalised rather than prescriptive. “ESG is often about deeply held beliefs, reflecting the individual values of the families we serve,” Kohler explains. “That’s why we do not impose our values but rather offer our clients a wide range of choices so they can invest in alignment with their values.” Incorporating ESG, he notes, is also a matter of sound investing. “Investors are constantly seeking to limit their investment universe by excluding poorly run or excessively risky companies. Incorporating ESG metrics is an attempt to evaluate and avoid risk – and identify opportunities – based on factors not always associated with investment decisions in the past.” While the human relationship remains at the core of client service, technology is playing an increasingly important role in portfolio construction and management. “Technology helps us make more informed decisions faster,” Kohler says. “We have a number of key partnerships that have given us access to market-leading technology that our clients benefit from as they feed into our internal processes and decision-making.” Still, he adds, “human interaction and judgement remain essential.” Traditional assets continue to offer a solid foundation for wealth preservation and growth. For Brown Shipley, it’s not just about selecting the right stocks or bonds, it’s about building long-term trust, leveraging innovation responsibly, and staying anchored to what matters most to clients. As Kohler puts it: “With the right allocation and solid instrument selection, traditional assets can continue to deliver superior long-term returns.”

Title: BTC reclaims $110k as Trump Media announces $2.5B Bitcoin treasury

Trump Media and Technology Group, a Donald Trump-linked company that’s publicly traded in the US, has announced it’s raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin price, which had hovered around $109k before the news, jumped to above $110,000 as bulls looked to reclaim the upper hand. The news comes as Bitcoin 2025, a major Bitcoin conference, begins in Las Vegas, with Trump sons Eric and Trump Jr expected as speakers. Nasdaq and NYSE Texas-listed Trump Media, trading under the ticker DJT, is the operator of Trump’s social media app Truth Social as well as streaming platform Truth+ and financial technology firm Truth.Fi. On Tuesday, the company revealed plans to raise $2.5 billion from 50 institutional investors, with subscription agreements targeting $1.5 billion of Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes. The funds raised from this private placement offering will close on May 29, 2025. According to the announcement, the proceeds of the offering will be used to adopt a Bitcoin treasury. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and chairman of Trump Media. Adding Bitcoin to the Trump family-owned company’s balance sheet will see it join other publicly-traded companies that now hodl billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. The biggest player in this corporate frenzy for BTC is Strategy, which has amassed over $40 billion in BTC since first buying it in 2020. The surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also seen BlackRock gobble up thousands of BTC as inflows mount. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital are Trump Media’s custody providers as it embarks on this BTC treasury venture. Other companies to help TMTG are Yorkville Securities and Clear Street as co-lead placement agents, and Cantor Fitzgerald as financial advisor. Bitcoin price changed hands around $110,065 at the time of writing, just 1.7% off its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, 2025.

Title: Google slashes quantum requirement to crack Bitcoin by 95% with technology a decade away

Expert predictions point to a possible Bitcoin split due to rising quantum computing capabilities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s cryptographic resilience is facing renewed questions after a Google researcher suggested that quantum computers may be capable of breaking its encryption far sooner than expected. Craig Gidney, a leading quantum computing researcher at Google, published new findings indicating that the hardware requirements to break 2048-bit RSA encryption, a key mathematical element similar to that of Bitcoin, have dropped significantly. Gidney pointed out that his earlier estimates placed the threshold at 20 million noisy qubits, but the new projection requires fewer than one million. The reduced computational burden marks a significant leap in quantum capability, though it might take several days instead of a few hours. The Google researcher attributes the advancement to more refined quantum algorithms and enhanced error correction techniques that reduce the number of physical qubits needed by encoding logical qubits more efficiently. The revelations arrive as concerns grow over the pace of quantum computing development. Last year, Google introduced its Willow chip, a next-generation quantum processor that many believe brought real-world threats to digital security closer than previously assumed. In response, major financial institutions are updating their disclosures. For example, BlackRock recently flagged quantum computing as a material risk for its Bitcoin ETF product, IBIT. According to the firm: “If quantum computing technology is able to advance and significantly increase its capacity relative to the capacity of today’s leading quantum computers, it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like Bitcoin.” This shift reflects growing awareness that technological breakthroughs could challenge Bitcoin’s foundational encryption earlier than anticipated. Despite the concern, some experts believe the crypto sector still has time to adapt to the potential risks. Today’s logical-qubit demos top out at dozens (e.g., Quantinuum’s 12 logical qubits). Gidney’s 1,000,000-qubit figure is about physical (noisy) qubits, not logical. We’re three orders of magnitude away in sheer qubit count, and need major error-rate breakthroughs. Even the physical-qubit goal is likely 8–12 years out, and a true million-logical-qubit machine is decades away. Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger believes the emergence of a “quantum-resistant” version of the top crypto is inevitable. He anticipates a network split between a newly fortified Bitcoin and a legacy version, similar to how Ethereum split into ETH and Ethereum Classic. He stated: “Ulimately there will be a fork. ‘Quantum Resistant Bitcoin (QRB)’ and ‘Bitcoin Classic.’ The big money will recognize and push QRB. Some will fight it. Bitcoin Classic (BTC) will become the new Ethereum Classic.” Still, if Bitcoin becomes vulnerable in eight years, the network will not have long to adopt a quantum-resistant upgrade.

Prometheum, the controversial digital asset securities firm, is aiming to achieve a jumpstart in the lucrative tokenization boom, acquiring a broker-dealer and launching a digital transfer agent registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company told CoinDesk exclusively. ProFinancial, the firm’s newly acquired FINRA-member and SEC-registered broker-dealer, can offer primary sales of various securities products, giving issuers a pathway to raise capital directly in tokenized form. Prometheum Coinery, meanwhile, handles shareholder records and corporate actions both on and off the blockchain. The additions build on existing services for custody, clearing, and secondary trading via its affiliated broker-dealers, Prometheum Capital and Prometheum ATS. With the latest move, the company aims to position as one of the few U.S.-regulated players offering a vertically integrated route for bringing real-world assets into a blockchain-native format—a capability likely to become more critical as the tokenization trend matures. "Securities, commodities, everything else is moving on-chain, and there needs to be an infrastructure for that. [There's] a pie that's going to grow significantly, just like everything went from paper to electronic," Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO told CoinDesk in an interview. "We are in a prime position, in my opinion, to be a significant player in that growing ecosystem." The expansion comes as asset tokenization emerges as one of the fastest-growing corners of crypto tech at a time when U.S. regulators signal a friendlier approach towards digital assets. Tokenization stands for using blockchain rails for moving and managing traditional instruments like bonds, funds and other securities, with global asset managers and banks increasingly getting involved to achieve operational efficiencies and cheaper, faster settlements. It's potentially a lucrative opportunity: the tokenized asset market could balloon to multiple trillion dollars over the next few years, a range of reports from BCG, Ripple, McKinsey, 21Shares projected. It's no surprise then that tokenization firms are jockeying for position to seize the opportunity as the sector heats up. Recently, digital asset manager Superstate registered its transfer agent with the SEC and unveiled a tokenized equity trading platform. Securitize, a tokenization firm backed by BlackRock and Jump Crypto, purchased MG Stover's fund administration business, while financial services provider Apex Group last week announced the acquisition of tokenization specialist Tokeny. Prometheum, founded in 2017, made headlines over the past years with efforts to comply with the Gary Gensler-led SEC, known for its harsh stance towards crypto. The company also divided the digital asset industry with wanting to provide securities-focused services for cryptocurrencies like ether ETH$2,644.65. With the new entities, the firm is now able to offer a fully-integrated platform for tokenized securities, from initial issuance to secondary market trading and custody, all within U.S. securities laws, something that's difficult to achieve, Kaplan argued. "It's a much bigger lift than what was done previously with these other [tokenization] firms," Kaplan said. Creating a digital token of an asset is the "low-hanging fruit," while being able to handle trading and post-trading are "exponentially harder," he explained. "The harder parts are what we built first," he said. "Other [firms] went the other route, which was the lowest hanging fruit first, and they've had a harder time transitioning the other way." "So with this announcement, it's pretty clear that the low-hanging fruit is in our purview," he said. Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

ByMax (Chong) Li ByMax (Chong) Li, Contributor. ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - MAY 15: U.S. President Donald J. Trump signs the guestbook as UAE ... More President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan looks on and gives a thumbs up gesture after a meeting at Qasr al Watan (Palace of the Nation) on May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Trump is on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and regional allies including the UAE, focusing on security and economic collaboration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) I’ve spent a decent amount of springtime in Abu Dhabi this year, seeing the UAE orchestrate a remarkable transformation from a traditional oil giant to a competent leader in the global digital economy. The push? AI and crypto, leveraging the nation's favorable policies and strategic geographic location while the two biggest economies in this world are at odds. Despite their individual strengths, AI and blockchain are increasingly interlaced, both striving towards systems that offer better autonomy, transparency, and data-driven intelligence, reshaping industries through their combined innovative potential. This drive will largely help the UAE capitalize on their complementary advantages to rewrite the global economic and technological race during this time of uncertainty. To know how the UAE is playing their range, we must look differently through the lens of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the two iconic sites that share responsibility for the nation’s strategic ascent to leadership in Web3 and AI. Dubai's strategy is characterized by its emphasis on agility, a strong commercial focus, and a clear ambition to be a global hub for FinTech, AI, and Web3. It leverages its established reputation as a business-friendly environment with world-class infrastructure, together with its latest push to build supportive regulatory frameworks to attract innovation, talent, and capital. Abu Dhabi's strategy is more geared towards a top-down, institutional approach, emphasizing foundational research, advanced technology development, and the establishment of strategic, large-scale infrastructure projects. It aims to become a global leader in AI and institutional-grade digital assets through significant government investment and fostering deep partnerships. To conclude, this dual approach allows the UAE to capitalize on a broad spectrum of opportunities in the global digital economy. As for the long-term results, questions that remain to be asked include:

US government authorities are accusing the asset management giants BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard of colluding against the coal industry. In November of last year, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, accused the three financial firms of engaging in an anticompetitive conspiracy to drive down coal production. The attorneys general allege the firms tapped their influence as shareholders in competing coal companies to reduce industrywide coal output, illegally sharing competitively sensitive information in the process. Now, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have filed a “Statement of Interest” in support of the AGs’ case. The federal officials argue that BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard’s alleged conduct increased energy prices for consumers and businesses. “This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even pro-competitive activism. As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Google Researchers Claim Quantum Computers Could Break Bitcoin with 20x Less Effort than Previous Estimates

Google has released a research paper which suggests that quantum computers may be able to crack encryption standards, such as those used by Bitcoin, with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. A Google quantum researcher, Craig Gidney, said developers must ascertain the costs of creating quantum-safe cryptocurrencies to achieve the transition process. Cryptography standards, such as RSA, may be at a higher risk of being cracked than previously thought. Bitcoin users, especially those with custodial funds, may need to measure the risks to safeguard their crypto from quantum attacks. Quantum computing can solve complex puzzles, such as the ones used by Bitcoin to measure proof-of-work, thus presenting a new threat vector that places Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at risk. Bitcoin was designed for older computers, which are quickly becoming obsolete. Peter Shor, cryptographer and computer scientist, created a method called Shor’s algorithm to solve the complex puzzles used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Shor’s algorithm could be combined with a quantum computer to crack crypto wallets rapidly. An efficient algorithm, combined with a powerful computer, could increase the risk of a crypto portfolio, including digital assets that use proof-of-stake algorithms. Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, quantum researchers at Google, discussed their findings on their Google security blog. They addressed the ability of quantum computers to crack public key cryptography, particularly RSA, which could be compromised with a quantum computer of around 1 million noisy qubits. They made this conclusion after taking into account recent advancements in quantum computing. The number of qubits required to crack cryptography is lower than previous estimates. The researchers outlined strategies corporations could take to mitigate the risks of quantum computers, such as collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to transition to a post-quantum computing world. Symmetric cryptography is largely unaffected by this attack. However, cryptography, such as that used by cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to this attack due to the public exposure of addresses and the longevity of these wallets, providing attackers with a target they can attack for an extended period. NIST has set a timeline to phase out vulnerable systems by 2030 and ban them by 2035. Google has been confirming its strategy with NIST by implementing PQC signatures on its Cloud KMS service. IBM’s Condor, the most powerful quantum computer to date, can only reach 1,121 qubits, which is way short of the million qubits needed to crack RSA encryption. Cryptocurrency seems to be safe for now, unless a new technological innovation can dramatically increase the number of qubits. Google’s Sycamore, another quantum computer, can only get 53 qubits. However, the trend of quantum development suggests that crypto users must take these risks seriously. The Google researchers argue that the increased risk occurs because of technological advancements such as improved error correction and better algorithms. Modular exponentiation, for example, has been made more efficient, effectively doubling its speed. Modular arithmetic is a vital part of cryptographic systems. Further, the researchers found that error correction improvements can speed up their algorithm. They found that creating a separate layer for error correction allowed the qubits layer to be more dense, holding more information to be processed, speeding up the algorithm overall. The researchers could drop the qubit requirement by optimising code at a programmable level. Hackers could further exploit such optimizations to secretly lower the qubit requirements until a future date when quantum computers are more accessible. In early May 2025, BlackRock added a line to their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing, stating that quantum computing poses a risk to the long-term security of Bitcoin. The filing states that if quantum computing advances enough, it could be used to crack the underlying encryption algorithms used to power Bitcoin. BlackRock is concerned that quantum computers will undermine crypto markets and technology. Quantum computers can potentially disrupt the business model of Silicon Valley, potentially causing a market crash. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, should consider the potential risks of quantum computers. The fact that such a large bank like BlackRock is taking the risk seriously shows that quantum risks could be closer than we think.

Title: Locked Out of the Dream: Regulation Makes Homes Unaffordable
URL: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/05/27/locked_out_of_the_dream_regulation_making_homes_unaffordable_around_the_world_1111741.html

Full Content:
The first in a two-part series on the global housing crisis. Next to inflation, Americans ranked housing as their top financial worry in a Gallup survey last May. It’s only gotten worse. January home sales were down 5% from last year’s dismal numbers. Record numbers of first-time buyers are stuck on the sidelines as housing affordability stands at the lowest level ever recorded, while one in three Americans now spend over 30% of their income on mortgage or rent. The housing crisis is not just an American problem, but a global phenomenon that hits the middle and working classes the hardest. Studies of the Canadian, British, European, and East Asian markets have also found that housing prices have risen far faster than household incomes and inflation. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that “housing has been the main driver of rising middle-class expenditure.” In prosperous and communitarian Switzerland, Zurich studios sell for well over $1 million, and small houses even more, making downpayments unaffordable to affluent people despite the overwhelming financial advantages to homeowners. Underlying the plight of home buyers worldwide is a sometimes overlooked but profound influence – the spread of restrictive land-use regulations. It’s reshaping political and economic alignments in ways that may further destabilize the social order. Home ownership is strongly correlated with positive social indicators, and as renting grows twice as quickly as buying, this trend poses a threat to Western democracy by deepening economic inequality, depressing demographic vitality, and undermining the upward mobility that has driven Western progress for the past century. Cost of Over-Regulation The price increase may seem surprising because there has not been a huge spike in fundamental demand. In California, and most of the United States, as well as Europe and East Asia, population growth is tepid, if not declining. Today’s higher interest rates are below those that prevailed from 1970 to 1995, when housing costs were considerably lower relative to incomes. Nor is this predominantly a technical problem; the rise of remote work, which is connected to migration to smaller metros, as well as new technologies for building, including using 3D printers, actually offers the chance to build more cheaply. And yet, the principal cause for housing shortages and rising prices stems from the failure to build enough new housing units, particularly the single-family homes consumers most desire. Homebuilders built 1 million fewer homes (including rental units) in 2024 than in 1972, when there were 130 million fewer Americans. One estimate puts the U.S. housing market shortage at an estimated 4.5 million homes, according to Commerce Department data. The rapid inflation of housing costs stems primarily from ever more constricting land-use regulations. Inflated prices are particularly rife in countries and states with strict regulations like California, where high-income households now utterly dominate the housing market, and more than a third of all real estate transactions in recent years topped $1 million. At the crux of the problem is a series of housing policies referred to as “urban containment.” First implemented in Britain at the end of the Second World War, urban containment policies typically seek to manage growth by imposing boundaries or greenbelts around urban areas, outside of which new development is either prohibited or severely limited. Decades ago, there was ample land within these boundaries, but this has changed as population growth has stimulated more demand. The simple fact is that once the urban limits are reached, land prices along the boundaries – the suburbs and exurbs – and in the areas still open to development inevitably rise. This mimics the effects of the 1970s gasoline embargoes that drove prices through the roof – and is nothing more than basic economics. Rationing tends to increase prices. To this flawed approach, many jurisdictions have imposed other costs such as high-impact fees, lengthy environmental reviews, minimum parking mandates, and historical preservation designations. But generally, nothing quite compares with urban containment, as it drives up land costs by restricting development on the periphery, where land prices are the lowest. In almost all cases, the highest housing prices occur in markets that are characterized by this planning strategy. This includes all markets in Australia and New Zealand and many in Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. In the U.S., the worst housing inflation has been in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Colorado, all states that apply the tightest large regulatory noose around new developments, particularly on and beyond the urban fringe. The connection between policy and prices is clearly evident. As late as 1970, only a few markets were shaped by urban containment. As its influence grew, so did prices. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” at three or less in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Today, the median multiple in these countries tends to be over five. But the worst results, as seen in most recent Demographia International Housing Affordability Study – Hong Kong, Sydney, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Adelaide, Honolulu, San Francisco, Melbourne, Brisbane, as well as Greater London, are at a remarkable nine or above. Perhaps counterintuitively, higher density development – often seen as the alternative to “sprawl” – does not lower prices, as is sometimes suggested. In fact, U.S. data suggests a positive correlation between greater density and housing costs. Among 53 major metros, those with more single-family housing and larger lot sizes (key indicators of lower density) have substantially better housing affordability. The effects of density-focused policies on people and regions are profound. One study found the median family in San Jose or San Francisco would need 125 years (150 in Los Angeles) to save enough money to afford a down payment on a median-priced home; in Atlanta or Houston, the figure is 12 years. Highly restrictive planning policies also impact renters. A recent RAND study of California found that policy-driven delays, strict architectural standards, green mandates, and the requirement to pay union-level wages have increased the cost of construction of subsidized apartments twice as much as in Texas, while taking almost two years longer to get approved. Portland, Ore., a pioneer in urban containment, embraces high-density housing, but high prices have driven multifamily construction to the lowest level in a decade. Collapse of the Dream Urban containment and other planning policies have devastated middle-class aspirations in every country or region that adopts them, even in countries like Australia, which enjoy a vast land mass and a smallish population. Australian cities once characterized by family-friendly neighborhoods are now dominated by dense apartments and condominiums. Planning regulations now add 55% to the price of a home in Sydney, according to a recent Reserve Bank of Australia study. In greater Sydney, the median home price recently passed A$2 million (approximately US$1.3 million). This is higher relative to incomes than in Los Angeles, London, New York, Singapore, and Washington. Even Adelaide, geographically isolated and far from a dynamic global business locale, has higher prices, based on income, than Seattle, one of the world’s most dynamic tech hubs. According to projections from the Urban Taskforce, apartments will make up half of Sydney’s dwellings mid-century, whereas only one quarter of Sydney dwellings will be family-friendly detached homes. Young people are most impacted by this policy regime. In the U.S., homeownership for people under 35 has fallen fairly steadily since the Great Recession of 2008 and is now half that of people over 45. Similarly, in Australia, the percentage of households aged 25 to 34 owning homes has dropped from more than 60% in 1981 to only 45% in 2016. Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries, including Ireland, where only a third of millennials own a home, compared with almost two-thirds of baby boomers when they were the same age. At least one-third of British millennials are likely to remain renters permanently. Much of the same is occurring in the U.S. Whereas in 1969, the median price of a home cost about five years of a young adult’s income, today it costs nearly nine years. A new Institute for Family Studies report, “Homes For Young Families: A Pro-Family Housing Agenda,” says that since 1970, the share of young adults who own the home they live in has declined from 50% to around 25-30%. Ignoring Preferences In advocating such urban containment and other high-density housing policies, planners, backed by academia and most big media, set themselves against the overwhelming preferences of the public for less density and more spacious housing. Judge Glock, who is now affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, has noted that in Census Bureau data since 1950, the average density of the major continuously built-up urban areas has dropped from 6,000 people per square mile to 3,000. In recent years, smaller metropolitan areas have been growing the fastest, while net domestic migration is away from areas of higher density to areas of lower density. Since 1950, the share of U.S. population in core cities has fallen from 24% to under 15%. Even in California, despite government resistance, virtually all the growth over the last decade has been in farther-flung suburbs. As elsewhere, the preference for single-family homes is “ubiquitous,” according to recent research by Jessica Trounstine at the University of California, Merced. “Across every demographic subgroup analyzed,” she observes, respondents preferred single-family home developments by a wide margin. Relative to single-family homes, apartments are viewed as “decreasing property values, increasing crime rates, lowering school quality, increasing traffic, and decreasing desirability.” Once, it was widely suspected that young people would head to big core cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. But surveys reveal that nearly three in five younger people see homeownership as an essential part of the American dream, while two-thirds favor suburbs as their preferred residence. Three out of four Californians, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, opposed legislation that banned single-family zoning. A big driver of suburban growth is minorities and immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass suburbanization was widely associated with “white flight” and discrimination against minorities. But in the past decade, over 90% of all suburban growth in the U.S. came from minorities; currently, more than three-quarters of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. live in the suburbs. Similar patterns are also evident in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. Today, most high-income countries are primarily suburban. A Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 census results indicates that more than 75% of the population lives in the suburbs, which absorbed more than 80% of the growth between 2016 and 2021. Even in transit-rich and land-short Japan, residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are dispersing away from the urban core to suburban and exurban areas after these cities nearly monopolized national population growth over the previous decade. Much the same can be said of Seoul, South Korea, which is even denser than the Japanese megacities. An analysis of the 53 U.S. major metropolitan areas finds that more than 85% of residents live in suburban or exurban neighborhoods and that more than 90% of the population growth since 2010 has been in the suburbs and exurbs. These choices underscore an analysis of Canadian poll results by Sotheby’s, which suggests a “disconnect” between urban planning and consumer preferences: The “picture is of young urban families overwhelmingly preferring detached houses, and decidedly not the condominiums into which planners are driving them.” As Sotheby’s puts it, “The report dispels myths about young, urban families’ housing preferences.” Among Americans under 35 who do buy homes, four-fifths choose single-family detached houses. According to a recent National Homebuilders Association report, over 66%, including those living in cities, prefer a house in the suburbs. Almost two-thirds of U.S. millennials (25 to 44) favor being owners, which is also the case in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The future vision of the planners has little attraction among the public. Upward Mobility or Neo-Feudalism? Whatever their desires, without an affordable home, millennials and Gen Z will face a formidable challenge in boosting their net worth. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans; homeowners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters. Not surprisingly, most young people still believe in creating wealth through ownership. Yet rather than allowing for greater dispersal of wealth, as was the case in previous decades, the decline of housing affordability is a critical factor driving inequality, notes a recent study by Bank for International Settlements (Berne) economist Gianni La Cava. In more historically feudal Great Britain, land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade, and less than 1% of the population owns half of all the land. On the continent, farmland is increasingly concentrated while urban real estate has fallen into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. The left-wing economist Thomas Piketty has identified high housing costs as a driver of increasing inequality even in purported social democracies like Germany and France. This is also the case in the U.S., where about 71% of the increase in housing wealth between 2010 and 2020 was gained by high-income households, according to the National Association of Realtors. Increasingly, home ownership relies on the classic feudal formula – being born into “the funnel of privilege.” In the U.S., millennials are three times as likely as boomers to count on inheritance for their retirement. Among the youngest cohort, those ages 18–22, over 60% see inheritance as their primary source of support as they age. In high-price markets like Los Angeles and Orange County, California, close to 40% of loans rely on family money for qualification, up from 25% in 2011. Threat to Democracy Most democratic or republican societies in history – in Athens, Rome, the Netherlands, Britain, France, North America, Oceania – were created and sustained by a broad property-owning middle class. In the twentieth century, middle-class asset growth was accomplished in large part by the expansion of an urban footprint beyond the city core, allowing many more citizens to buy property in spacious, safe environments offering a measure of privacy. The ideal of broadly dispersed property ownership has long been promoted by politicians, both right and left, in most high-income countries. “A nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their land, is unconquerable,” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He saw homeownership as critical not only to the economy but to democracy and the very idea of self-government. Today, the trend towards democratization of landownership is being reversed, with more and more people being pushed into living in rented apartments or houses, with little chance of gaining financial independence. An economy where most people rely upon wealth transfers from the more fortunate cannot easily coexist with a tradition of individual initiative and self-governance. At the very least, the drive to create lifetime renters and forced densification sets a stage for a future political conflict and social disruption, particularly for the younger generation. In a Harvard poll of 18- to 29-year-olds this year, housing ranked as the third-most important issue overall, after inflation and health care. In California, almost 70% of residents consider housing costs a major concern, while in Britain, housing rose to be one of the top five issues for voters, well ahead of defense, security, poverty, and crime. The housing affordability crisis impacts a host of life decisions. Studies of the U.S. have found that higher house prices had a direct impact on the decision of couples to have children. Research in Germany and across 18 European and North American nations also found that high housing prices defer family formation, leading to lower fertility as well as marriage rates, particularly among the working class. On the flip side, a new study by the Federal Reserve Board reports that homeowners are not only more affluent than renters, they are also physically and mentally healthier, vote more often, and their children achieve higher levels of education. Many advocates of forced densification and renting justify their views around “green” and “sustainability” concerns. The environmental magazine Grist has envisioned “a hero generation” that will escape the material trap of suburban living and work that engulfed their parents. One magazine editor proudly declared herself a part of the GINK generation (as in “green inclinations, no kids”) that she said meant not only a relatively care-free and low-cost adult life, but also “a lot of green good that comes from bringing fewer beings onto a polluted and crowded planet.” Less motivated by planetary concern, major Wall Street investors are also focusing on crowding people into small spaces and a life of permanent rentership. Britain’s Lloyds Bank and BlackRock have placed multi-billion-dollar bets on buying homes for the rental market. In the first quarter of 2021, investors accounted for roughly one out of every seven homes bought, a marked increase from previous years. A notion embraced by some financial groups as well as greens is one of a rentership society where people remain renters for life, enjoying their video games or attending to their houseplants, never knowing the pleasure of having a real garden or backyard of their own. It might assure a steady profit for the landlord class, but it would destroy the dream of ownership for the average person. The broader effect may resemble a modern form of feudalism, where both inherited wealth and institutional ownership, often the Church, concentrate control over housing. Need for Reform If unchecked, the pattern of declining ownership and rising prices for housing could shape the politics of the future, particularly among young people. Not surprisingly, many renters tend to favor leftist policies such as rent control and housing subsidies. The development of a class of permanent renters seems ideal for fomenting class warfare directed at an ever-shrinking number of owners, by a vast majority with no real assets, and little chance of getting any. Ultimately, the battle over land and property will define our future. We either accommodate hope among those in the next generation or force them to accept a lifetime of rental serfdom and permanent subservience to the state, or big capital, or both. As Conor Dougherty of The New York Times put it, “For all the focus on billionaires and stock prices, it’s home values that are a primary source of wealth inequality and the root of a generational schism between the housing-rich baby boomers and young adults today.” He quotes Edward Glaeser, a premier housing economist at Harvard, who said that the housing crisis has become “a huge hindrance on the quest for well-being and the pursuit of happiness.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

Title: Economic Shifts Are Impacting Opportunities For Self-Directed IRAs

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs) allow investors to put their retirement savings in private market assets like real estate, private equity, venture capital and crypto. The demand for self-directed IRAs has steadily grown as it has become easier for retail investors to open these accounts and tap into alternative markets. Anticipated major economic shifts will likely accelerate this trend in investor preferences. Investors must navigate several challenges in 2025 that make private market investment strategies through a self-directed IRA more appealing. Inflation has been stubbornly high since the Covid-19 pandemic. Prices could rise even more throughout 2025 due to tariffs and a global trade war. Consumers expect inflation to rise as high as 6.5% by year-end, according to an April 2025 survey from the University of Michigan. Inflation badly damages the returns of traditional fixed-income investments like bonds. It can also be a drag on stock market returns. On the other hand, physical assets like real estate hold their value during inflationary periods. Market interest rates are still high by recent historical standards, despite Federal Reserve rate cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed may need to keep rates high or even increase them to battle ongoing inflation. That would reduce bond prices and squeeze profit margins for companies, hurting their stock prices. Certain private market assets have more room to navigate high interest rates. Private credit funds may issue floating-rate debt, which allows them to earn more when rates go up, versus fixed-rate bonds that are locked in. Market volatility and uncertainty remain high as investors don’t know what to expect under new government policies. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, is around its highest level since 2022. Diversification across assets and markets remains the best protection against severe losses as it limits exposure to one area. Private market assets have a low correlation to traditional markets and can smooth out performance. For example, a hedge fund following a long-short strategy could still earn money during market declines, balancing out stock losses. Investors are adjusting their behaviors, portfolios and retirement plans in the face of economic changes. Preqin, a financial data analytics company recently acquired by BlackRock, forecasts that the global private asset market will nearly double over the next few years, going from $16.8 trillion in 2023 to $29.2 trillion in 2029. Financial research sheds light on the value of using a different approach. A KKR study at the end of 2022 compared risk and returns from 1927 to 2021 for a portfolio of 40/30/30 stocks, bonds and private market assets, versus a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds. The portfolio with private market assets had higher average annual returns with less volatility, especially during periods of high inflation. Historically, inflation and market uncertainty create fear, pushing investors to more stable physical assets. While gold is a popular choice when investors are scared, other alternatives such as infrastructure and real estate offer similar protection. More importantly, they can generate income, whereas precious metals do not. Investors concerned about the 2025 economic trends could benefit in several ways by opening a self-directed IRA (SDIRA) for their retirement savings. • Tax Advantages: An SDIRA offers the same tax benefits as a traditional IRA: tax-deferred growth and an upfront tax deduction on contributions. Investors can tap into alternative markets while saving on taxes. • Diversification: Investors reduce risk and the chance of significant losses by adding uncorrelated assets to a portfolio. A self-directed IRA with alternative assets does so by not having all eggs in the traditional market basket. • Long-Term Growth: Many alternative investments offer higher growth potential. While these investments require a long-term focus, they can outperform the stock market over time. • Inflation Protection: Alternative assets perform especially well when inflation is high. An SDIRA provides this protection for retirement investors. At Alto, we strive to make investment options easy and cost-effective. For example, investors can now open an SDIRA in minutes thanks to online platforms like AltoIRA. The coming months will force investors to manage inflation, uncertainty and interest rate risk, a painful combination. Fortunately, modern investment strategies and capabilities are up to the task. Through an SDIRA, investors can tap into alternative markets previously only available to high-net-worth individuals. These other assets provide further diversification and are another hedge against economic risks. Investors should consult with their financial professionals to see how to optimize their portfolio for current market conditions and determine what role an SDIRA could play in expanding their retirement plan.

Title: Why the Government is banking on household batteries

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Households will increasingly be doing the heavy lifting to manage Australia’s energy transition as the cost of building new poles and wires soars. On Friday, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) revealed that for the first time household solar and batteries will play a much more important role in the nation’s energy roadmap. According to AEMO, ‘consumer energy resources’ (CER) will transition from being an input to the grid, i.e., via exported solar in the middle of the day, to becoming an important component of demand management via the networking of household batteries. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Australia is increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable resources for its energy mix, with as much as 40 per cent of power contributed from wind and solar, both rooftop and utility scale. 1 in 3 Australian households have rooftop solar, and when added to commercial rooftop solar arrays provide 25 gigawatts of energy. By comparison, Australia’s largest coal fired power plant, Eraring, contributes 2.9gW. But the excess of power created in the middle of the day has meant the economics of power generation has fundamentally changed, sending prices negative for hours and placing a potentially destabilising amount of load on the grid. As part of the Government’s net zero ambitions to get to 82 per cent renewable generation, an additional 11gw of energy will be added to the grid, much of which will also be delivered into the system during the middle of the day. According to Tim Buckley, a director at Climate Energy Finance and a former director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, too much production could trigger the kind of blackout that shut down Spain’s and Portugal’s grid for a day. “Probably the biggest lesson out of Spain, was they’ve got one of the highest renewable energy penetrations in the developed world, but one of the lowest battery capacities in the world,” Mr Buckley said “We need batteries to time shift demand from when solar is generating to when consumers are demanding it, and that is invaluable for grid stability.” Labor has committed $2.3 billion to subsidise the take-up of 1 million household batteries by 2030, providing up to 30 per cent off the upfront cost of installing eligible small-scale battery systems. While Mr Buckley worried that adding 1 million batteries in such a short time frame could create the kind of scramble for unskilled operators that were the worst part of the Rudd government’s Pink Batts scheme, he said the speed with which batteries could be added to the network made them a far more efficient model than other large scale generation investments. “Building transmission takes 10 years. Building nuclear takes 20 years. Building a utility battery takes 18 months to two and a half years, if you have to include connection. But an electrician can install a solar and battery combo behind the meter in one week,” he said. That could mean the shift to renewable energy could occur at a much faster rate and for less money than originally envisaged. The Government’s Rewiring the Nation project allocates $19b to help build 4,581 km of new transmission lines to connect so called Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) to major capitals. But AEMO’s s Draft 2025 Electricity Network Options Report revealed construction costs on some projects had jumped as much as 55 per cent in the past two years driven by supply chain constraints, workforce shortages, and the sheer scale and complexity of new projects. Sustained community pushback had also meant many projects faced longer delays, and more community consultation before being approved. Mr Buckley said things had changed drastically since Chris Bowen’s clarion call that there was “no transition without transmission,” in Labor’ first term. “AEMO is acknowledging that they have massively underestimated batteries. It is a quantum leap forward in AEMO thinking. The integrated system plan was a brilliant roadmap at a time Australia did not have a roadmap for renewable generation. “What they’ve effectively done this week is said ‘technologies are moving massively, capital costs are moving massively, battery costs have halved, grid transmission costs have doubled, and we need to evaluate the priority,” Mr Buckley said. The push to integrate households into the wider grid may help ease a growing logjam across the network. With rollout of transmission lines delayed by construction restraints and consumer pushback, project developers were increasingly struggling to ensure access to the grid. That was creating economic challenges for financing development, putting some generation projects at jeopardy. Compounding the problem was a hodge-podge of various government agencies that resulted in a complicated approval process. “We’ve now got a situation where we’ve got an alphabet soup of Australian government and state level organisations, and to some degree, rather than having too little resources, we’ve now got the situation where no one’s accountable,” Mr Buckley said. NSW’s 1680 megawatt Waratah battery was a case in point, Mr Buckley said. Funded by global investment giant BlackRock, the battery project was to act as a shock absorber in the system. It’s construction was completed on time, but delayed approvals meant it was missing its revenue targets. “This is the biggest battery in NSW, if even BlackRock can’t get this done, are they going to do it again?” Mr Buckley asked. It is possible the construction of new transmission may not need to be as comprehensive as first envisaged. Increasingly, the providers of household poles and wires, such as Ausgrid, believe they can play a role in connecting renewable projects more efficiently. Ausgrid won the tender to connect Newcastle’s renewable energy zone, meaning wires could be added to existing infrastructure. Distribution networks, such as Ausgrid, are designed for maximum loads, meaning they are underutilised as much as 70 per cent of the time. That could allow them to carry the newly installed capacity rather than it be connected to new, expensive transmission networks. Mr Buckley said poles and wires were already Australia’s largest asset at a value of $105b. “I would rather reassess and actually optimise the grid, rather than spending $20b that will become $40b on new transmission,” he said.

Title: Tether invests $5 billion profit into US companies while holding $120 billion in US debt

Tether's $5 billion profit reinvestment fuels Bitcoin innovation, brain-interface breakthroughs, and decentralized media. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed that it has reinvested around $5 billion of its profits into US-based companies and infrastructure over the past two years. In a May 26 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino disclosed that the company has made significant investments across American businesses and emerging technologies, reflecting what many described as a “pro-America” strategy. According to Ardoino, the investments cover a range of sectors, including decentralized media, neuroscience, and Bitcoin mining. Notable recipients include Rumble, a video-sharing platform; Blackrock Neurotech, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup; and several Bitcoin mining firms such as Swan Bitcoin. In one of its most significant moves, Tether acquired over 100 million Class A shares of Rumble for $770 million in January to support decentralized content platforms. Since then, the USDT issuer has collaborated with Rumble to launch a non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet. Another $200 million was funneled into Blackrock Neurotech in April 2024. The funding has reportedly supported medical breakthroughs, including efforts to restore patient communication abilities through brain-implanted devices. The company is also backing Bitcoin infrastructure. It has started allocating current and future hashrate to OCEAN, a mining pool operated by Mummolin Inc., a Wyoming-based firm. However, its relationship with Swan Bitcoin has become strained, with a legal dispute now underway. Beyond these equity investments, Tether has built a prominent position in US Treasuries. The company holds over $120 billion in total exposure through direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repo agreements. This makes Tether the 19th-largest holder of US Treasury bills globally, surpassing Germany’s $111.4 billion exposure, based on US Treasury Department data. The assets serve as its stablecoin reserves and are critical in maintaining USDT’s dollar peg. Most are reportedly held at Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading US financial institution. Meanwhile, Tether’s aggressive investment strategy follows a record-breaking year. In January, the firm reported over $13 billion in net profits for 2024. These earnings have strengthened its balance sheet and allowed for further expansion in agriculture, sports, and media despite ongoing scrutiny from regulators. While USDT remains the largest stablecoin and the third-biggest crypto asset by market cap, regulatory uncertainty in the US has led Tether to consider issuing a separate stablecoin tailored to comply with forthcoming rules.
