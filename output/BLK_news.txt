So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is like essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of America selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case,we demonetize our enemies. You know, gold capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet?So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now. My friend Dante had a question about storage. So I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?This is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is that I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now. And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option,,, coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. So for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100% secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned is in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there. So they’re trying to fear monger us. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government backed institution, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the the US Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would not trust anything outside of the States. If you’re super, you know, quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities which own the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?10-20, 30 years from now, right? With MSTR you’re going to actually outperform Bitcoin. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% ARR annual rate of return MicroStrategy is almost double that 120 to 125 ARR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns, you just buy microstrategy stock mstr. The issues is, you know let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. He dies in a Cybertruck self driving accident whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. If you want the least risky option, just put all your money into Bitcoin. And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have, I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoin. And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100% sure how it works if you’re a European. Anyways what you do is you buy microstrategy stock. So let’s say you buy, you know, $100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right. And the strategy is simple. Let us say the base case is $150,000. Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to $200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account, and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin — rinse and repeat. So very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stock, off of that $150,000 right and I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial $150,000. Once again I didn’t touch any of my principal. So essentially I made a free $240,000 dollars … in just 3 months! And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it had already like 3x’d. For example, My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like was $78,000, and then the course of 3 months it’s like now, $230,000. It peaked at around $300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. So the the very simple strategy– cut and reduce your expenses to a bare minimum. ￼So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s say you know, $5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right? the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live frugally. If anything live more frugally. So the funny paradox here is that when people say they want to become a millionaire, but they’re really mean to say is I want to spend $1 million. ￼ But the funny thing is the second you go out and you spend $1 million, you then become worth zero dollars. So actually, the game then is to stack your capital indefinitely and to see your numbers go up forever. And then the hilarious thing assuming that you’re like some sort of greedy money rich person, you actually continue to live as frugally as possible, and not touch your capital. ￼￼￼ I think one of the wise ways to think about money is like heat loss. For example, if you’re super effing cold, do you want to seal up the window windows and the spots of your house which loses heat. The same thing is with money and capital. You want to stop the capital loss. ￼So for example, the number one thing is the whole vehicle thing!￼ Never ever ever ever ever purchase any vehicle that requires premium gas. This is like the stupidest mistake of all time.￼ You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. The only thing worth purchasing on the planet is bitcoin. ￼ ￼Also some even more super smart economic leverage. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. So if you move to Southeast Asia, you can live like a king, for like $300-500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoin. So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you have microstrategy stock.Let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, microstrategy, assuming it’s around 2x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% ARR. I think microstrategy is going to double that 240% ARR. So just do the math. At the end of every single month in which expenses are due, let us say it’s like $1000 bucks or something… You just sell $1000 worth of bitcoin or microstrategy stock to just afford your lifestyle. ￼ But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the microstrategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it. So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the X prize guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand bitcoin. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography. But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better than film photography. And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. In the early days of digital ,,, digital photography sucked. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should shoot film in today’s world is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach. Or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snobby fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us,where we care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app. Buy Bitcoin. If you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is likeessentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.we demonetize our enemies.you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toto Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoI think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatI know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. Sofor me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isin terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?1020, 30 years from now, right?You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. Heyou know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockoff of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayyou know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthyou make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldis either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/15/2024 8:02:48 AM PST by Navy Patriot Ukraine's military leadership has replaced the commander overseeing defenses in the eastern Donetsk region where Russian forces are making swift advances, a military official said on Saturday. General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy, 54, was appointed to head the operational and tactical group Donetsk, replacing General Oleksandr Lutsenko, the official at the General Staff told Reuters. Lutsenko was criticized by Ukrainian military bloggers and some lawmakers for failing to stop Russian troops' relentless push toward the strategic Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk. The battles around Pokrovsk, a key logistic hub for Ukrainian military and civilians in the eastern Donetsk region, come at a critical juncture of the war. Ukraine is on the back foot on the battlefield as Russian troops advance at their fastest pace since the early days of Moscow's invasion in February 2022. Last month President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced several other generals, saying changes were needed. (Excerpt) Read more at newsmax.com ...

After almost 3 years, Russians keep advancing and taking the same 20% of Ukraine. Progress is measured by how much Russia keeps taking of the same 20% of Ukraine. At the rate the Russians have been advancing, they’ll have all of Ukraine by they year 3025, and Zelensky will be forced to negotiate then. 4 posted on 12/15/2024 8:29:32 AM PST by adorno ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: redfreedom If the Russians are indeed advancing faster, it could be a land grab before a ceasefire.

Title: Introduction to Bitcoin Transcript

Time Published: 2024-12-15T15:58:52Z
Full Content:
So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s 250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s 750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like 1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10 x gain. So just do the mass from then.Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right?And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors tried to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right?And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1926, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill.She’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do. It’s a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is likeessentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.we demonetize our enemies.you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toto Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoI think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatI know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. Sofor me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isin terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?1020, 30 years from now, right?You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. Heyou know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockoff of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayyou know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthyou make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldis either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalaccounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

FULL PRESENTATION VIDEO RECORDING DROPBOX AUDIO SLIDES PDF Introduction to Bitcoin Transcript Eric Kim: All right, we’ll get the party starting all right.Eric Kim: Hopefully, everything is hearing.Eric Kim: and yeah, thanks for tuning. All right, we’re gonna start all right.Eric Kim: So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. Eric, him right? So, starting off.Eric Kim: you know, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter?Eric Kim: So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam.Eric Kim: and I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, I essentially see at this point. Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, yourEric Kim: your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.Eric Kim: and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So I think also construct a way to start thinking about. Bitcoin is trying to figure out what Bitcoin is. Not. So my personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is.Eric Kim: everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is.Eric Kim: People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued.Eric Kim: The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalEric Kim: real estate.Eric Kim: So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on. You know their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad. Max Post. Apocalyptic perspective. Is that okay? So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentially.Eric Kim: there’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.Eric Kim: there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate.Eric Kim: You know, a lot of people like, yeah, you know, I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 16 hundreds, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of ScumbagEric Kim: San Francisco basedEric Kim: scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hit the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which meansEric Kim: effectively,Eric Kim: we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s sayEric Kim: Let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars.Eric Kim: So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity.Eric Kim: What that then means is.Eric Kim: I think, my mind the price of a single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be piped to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.1Eric Kim: 1.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a veryEric Kim: It’s a very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You can eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is thatEric Kim: essentially all money is just existing the value of men, and it is all essentially subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence.Eric Kim: All 100 trillion years we’ve been existing. Whatever is that? You had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example.Eric Kim: people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers.Eric Kim: But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 20 second century on young, you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts. If you’ve ever tried to send money,Eric Kim: you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole swift system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. And if I would just need to send her like any sort of small amount of monies, right? It’s like crazy. It’s like, why does it. Take 3 or 4 days. Cost like me, 55 bucks, and it’s like this should be done instantly. So I think it’s a big big big revolution.Eric Kim: So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter soEric Kim: one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. Sailor. It’s essentially Twitter or X at Sailor or michael.com.Eric Kim: and he uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. IEric Kim: you know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick.Eric Kim: And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times.Eric Kim: Dad perpetually addicted to gambling with away the rent monies, and so the whole the whole ethos. I had a kid ever since I was 15. Okay, I’m going to take every single penny. I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account.Eric Kim: and so I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is.Eric Kim: you cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster. Whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. AndEric Kim: a lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally.Eric Kim: my personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important thanEric Kim: like, okay, so my personal thought. This is all just my personal thoughts right?Eric Kim: So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot moreEric Kim: robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods.Eric Kim: And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right?Eric Kim: And so, capital. We all live under. Capitalism doesn’t matter. If you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. It’s like China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan. The cny is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. Is essentially the world. Reserve currencyEric Kim: andEric Kim: capital is what we seek, not money. Money, you know. Use money, like, you know. I’ll get into this little detail a little bit further. But talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right?Eric Kim: Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids.Eric Kim: And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials. Nowadays.Eric Kim: I think the disincentive to have kids isEric Kim: people. You know, there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become, you know.Eric Kim: boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.Eric Kim: It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No, you! That’sEric Kim: that’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about. How many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goalEric Kim: you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, 22 thousands. The subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know. Maybe it’s not always the best idea. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s aEric Kim: historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google. The M. 2 money supplies. And essentially what you will find isEric Kim: them to money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. And actually the thing that I call this the in and out Burger. Not in and out, Burger theEric Kim: the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, Patty, for a dollar 51 day we pop up. They say it’s 2 50, a burger. Patty, we’re like, we. What this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour increase our wage. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is withEric Kim: minimum wage. You cannot rewind theEric Kim: the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $70 an hour, there will be rights. The streets would not be not be good.Eric Kim: so we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as Mp. 3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal costing right? And so this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck.Eric Kim: It’sEric Kim: essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 1. 21 million coinsEric Kim: in existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just not how it works right?Eric Kim: And soEric Kim: I think there’s different ways. You can think about it right? So you could think about like I also could. Another fun analogy I think about is that let’s say one Bitcoin is like one cyberox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever right. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the futures. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Even if I could tell you right. So once again, the single family home analogy, let’s say.Eric Kim: let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only a hundred $1,000 or a hundred €1,000 you’d be like, Wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is.Eric Kim: Bitcoin is far more valuable than digital real estate, because in the next 2030 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers. The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! That take over everyone’s going to not really care about physical real estate no more. It’ll be digital cyber real estate, which is Bitcoin.Eric Kim: So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, Eric, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr.Eric Kim: Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat cream, barbecuedEric Kim: paid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. And so my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to Uc. As undergrad my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior here’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like.Eric Kim: Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and you just bought a bitcoin like I bought 2 domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of it, and just see what happened. I’m like, sounds like a scam and disregarded it, and I did the math. Now, if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the timeEric Kim: for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers, and my then next reintroduction to Bitcoin wasEric Kim: kind of more recently when moving to La. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018,Eric Kim: and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was 320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, lighting in the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a thousand $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe 6 700 bucks a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightEric Kim: and just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I’m either school bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only aboutEric Kim: $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So 7 k, so I bought about what? 3 and a half bitcoins at the time. For $25,000. Put some of that into digibyte, held a bitcoin or 2, and essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the doge coins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal.Eric Kim: I think I think you know. Also, some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newEric Kim: World economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like his.Eric Kim: you know the profit. You know the next profit of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions right to invest in religions, to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon, musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right?Eric Kim: So essentially and then, more. Now, like, you know. Obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative like. Once again, if you could have discovered Internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others.Eric Kim: So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right?Eric Kim: So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be 13 million of Bitcoin bear case, 3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is 49 million a Bitcoin, and no, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worthEric Kim: following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, a similar scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. And Eric Trump.Eric Kim: AndEric Kim: essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and Cabinet, whatever right? And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoinEric Kim: government of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years. Once Trump takes office, January 20, th 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I thinkEric Kim: once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve.Eric Kim: And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin.Eric Kim: So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s 250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s 750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like 1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10 x gain. So just do the mass from then.Eric Kim: Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right?Eric Kim: And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors tried to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right?Eric Kim: And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1926, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill.Eric Kim: She’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do. It’s a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.Eric Kim: super fascinating, is likeEric Kim: essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of selling America, selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case, comma.Eric Kim: we demonetize our enemies.Eric Kim: you know, capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet.Eric Kim: So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States toEric Kim: to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now.Eric Kim: you know, issues. My, my friend Dante had a question about storage. SoEric Kim: I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?Eric Kim: I, my, this is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is thatEric Kim: I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now.Eric Kim: And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. SoEric Kim: for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100 secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned isEric Kim: in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenEric Kim: seeking the simplest, most straightforward optionEric Kim: that is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever’s right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there.Eric Kim: and so they’re trying to fear monger use. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the You know the Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would. I would not trust anything outside of the States.Eric Kim: But yeah, I would say, choose now, obviously, if you’re super, you know.Eric Kim: quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.Eric Kim: I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities with the owners of the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?Eric Kim: 1020, 30 years from now, right?Eric Kim: You’re going to actually outperform. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% AR annual rate of return micro strategies is almost double that 120 to 1, 25 AR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns. You just buy microstrategy stock mstr and bitcoin. Right? But the issues is, you know. Let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. HeEric Kim: you know, dies in a Cybertruck, whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. So if you want the least risky option, it’s just put all your money into Bitcoin right? And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have. I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoins right?Eric Kim: And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100 sure how it works. If you’re a European. What is right. But you, you buy micro strategy stocks. So let’s say you buy, you know, 100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right.Eric Kim: And the strategy is simple. It’s whenever you know. Let us say the base case 150,000.Eric Kim: Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to 200,000. Right?Eric Kim: You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account.Eric Kim: and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin right and rinse and repeat so very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stockEric Kim: off of that $150,000 right? And I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000Eric Kim: off of that initial 150,000 right? And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it is already like 3 x like, for example.Eric Kim: My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like what $78,000, and then the course of 3 months. It’s like now, it’s like 230,000. It peaked at around 300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. And so the the very simple strategy. So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s sayEric Kim: you know, 5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right?Eric Kim: the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live for good. If anything live more fully. People who says like, Oh, you know, you want to get rich, don’t care about money or whatever. If you’re a real real greedy, you know money, loving person. Actually, the optimal strategy is.Eric Kim: you live, you know. You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Eric Kim: Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. So and also some e even more super smart economic leverage. Right?Eric Kim: So instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. Right you go. Move to Southeast Asia, live like a king, for like 300 500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoins right? So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you had microstrategy stock.Eric Kim: let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, micro strategy, assuming it’s around 2 x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% error. I think micro strategy is going to double that 240% error. So just do the masses. At the end of every single monthEric Kim: you make a small. Your gains go up like crazy right, and let’s say your living expenses are like under a thousand bucks, or if you, if you live in the States, 5,000 bucks, you sell X amount of monies to just support your living expenses, and you just continue to ride your gains. But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the micro strategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it.Eric Kim: So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the ex guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.Eric Kim: So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography.Eric Kim: But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better.Eric Kim: And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingEric Kim: digital photography is actually superior to film photography. I mean.Eric Kim: maybe in the early days of digital sucked right. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should film in today’s worldEric Kim: is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach.Eric Kim: or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snoppy fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Eric Kim: because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us.Eric Kim: where you care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay.Eric Kim: so how to start buying Bitcoin. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app, or you know if you if you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy micro strategy stock Mstr, and use your traditionalEric Kim: accounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?Eric Kim: But you know what I think people want to do isEric Kim: they don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.Eric Kim: people want to spend a million dollars.Eric Kim: They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andEric Kim: capital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thatEric Kim: each bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toEric Kim: get rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.Eric Kim: building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Eric Kim: Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalEric Kim: to give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowEric Kim: I think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, soEric Kim: nuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndEric Kim: I think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsEric Kim: is because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?Eric Kim: It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?Eric Kim: And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostEric Kim: desirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Eric Kim: Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.Eric Kim: I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatEric Kim: every other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.Eric Kim: It does not have a hard capEric Kim: like you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.Eric Kim: So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyEric Kim: you know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. SoEric Kim: yeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.Eric Kim: So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. SoEric Kim: essentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? AndEric Kim: what we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.Eric Kim: a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.Eric Kim: and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Eric Kim: Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatEric Kim: all these assets on the planet.Eric Kim: Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.Eric Kim: let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? AndEric Kim: as a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really notEric Kim: a money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightEric Kim: at best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.Eric Kim: So the big thought is once again, you know.Eric Kim: the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.Eric Kim: You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.Eric Kim: You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.Eric Kim: So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Eric Kim: Now people always ask.Eric Kim: what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.Eric Kim: combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theirEric Kim: you know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatEric Kim: if you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.Eric Kim: And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownEric Kim: Bitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.Eric Kim: apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.Eric Kim: It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Eric Kim: Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorEric Kim: so there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. ButEric Kim: essentially the S. And P. 500 right?Eric Kim: on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?Eric Kim: And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.Eric Kim: I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeEric Kim: Bitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeEric Kim: over 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoEric Kim: I mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Eric Kim: Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.Eric Kim: I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.Eric Kim: And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.Eric Kim: So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on GithubEric Kim: plug in your own assumptions.Eric Kim: And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? AndEric Kim: butEric Kim: one Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?Eric Kim: And the big thought is.Eric Kim: there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be theEric Kim: the greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.Eric Kim: America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkEric Kim: assuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?Eric Kim: So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.Eric Kim: So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thatEric Kim: everyone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.Eric Kim: and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Eric Kim: Essentially the thought is.Eric Kim: anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a BitcoinEric Kim: in 4 yearsEric Kim: as long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought isEric Kim: chasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were badEric Kim: 2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termEric Kim: so practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, soEric Kim: some some simple thoughts.Eric Kim: there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.Eric Kim: 100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayEric Kim: Let’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upEric Kim: beyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?Eric Kim: $150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000Eric Kim: for living expenses. Let’s sayEric Kim: you need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.Eric Kim: also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?Eric Kim: So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedEric Kim: statistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’sEric Kim: nobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresEric Kim: a charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?Eric Kim: But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.Eric Kim: So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.Eric Kim: And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% toEric Kim: not lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.Eric Kim: And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?Eric Kim: So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750Eric Kim: $1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inEric Kim: Us. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.Eric Kim: So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: ‘A huge regression’: Walmart’s DEI rollback incites new racial equity push

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: A year after the murder of George Floyd, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart had a warning for corporate America. The death of Floyd triggered a wave of protest over systemic racism and was “not an isolated event. We have a long history of racism, and we see unacceptable events continue.” Walmart and other large US corporations made pledges to address inequities within their business, ones many feared would be dropped once the focus on Floyd’s killing and its aftermath faded. “We can’t let that be the case,” he wrote, outlining how the company was releasing its “diversity metrics twice a year” and calling on companies to “continue to address systemic racism and the structural inequities that are rooted in this nation’s history of slavery and that persist today”. Times have changed. Last month Walmart became the latest corporation to cave to a rightwing campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, announcing it would stop using the term DEI altogether, drop DEI trainings, no longer consider race and gender as a means to improve diversity when making offers to suppliers and would not renew a racial equity center committed to addressing “the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people”. For TaNeka Hightower the news was like a “slap in the face”. A Walmart employee for about seven years in Memphis, Tennessee, Hightower said: “I identify with all of the groups pretty much covered up under the DEI. I question, do I still want to work at Walmart because they don’t acknowledge the safety concerns. They don’t acknowledge, the livable wage concerns, and then now I’m being slapped in the face because the groups that I identify with are being told you are no longer protected by us.” Walmart’s decision was celebrated by the conservative activist Robby Starbuck who has campaigned against similar initiatives at Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe’s and others. However, it appears the company’s plans to roll back its DEI policies were in the works before Starbuck’s intervention. Hightower said she found the reversal “very disturbing”. She said there was no communication provided to workers about the changes, rather she found out about the rollbacks via the news. “This just further confirms that we’re no longer a part of the family. We never really were. We were invited to the table to assist, helping the table get prepared, but we weren’t actually supposed to eat from said table,” she said. The union-backed Walmart workers group United for Respect has tried to introduce a shareholder proposal at Walmart’s past two annual shareholder meetings for a third-party independent racial equity audit of the corporation. The racial equity shareholder proposal has come up short of the 20% support it would need for Walmart to discuss it, receiving 18% in 2023 and just over 15% in 2024. Hightower said she planned on reintroducing it at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas. The multibillionaire Walton family hold about 46% of Walmart’s shares and about 35% of the company’s shares are held by investment groups, banks, and other institutions including BlackRock. The shareholder proposal received 42% support from shareholders not part of the Walton family in 2023. Related: Trump promises a crackdown on diversity initiatives. Fearful institutions are dialing them back already Hightower said she had been pushing for the audit “to see the disparities of how people of color are selected for those upper roles, how there’s a difference in the pay, how there’s a difference in the workload expectations based on race, color and gender”. Bianca Agustin, co-executive director at United for Respect said the DEI rollback policies came as a surprise to shareholders at Walmart and were concerning given Walmart is the largest private employer in the US overall and for Black Americans and women. “Given Walmart’s sheer size as the largest employer in the world, and the demographics of both their domestic workforce and their suppliers it was just very disappointing,” Agustin said. “This is just a huge regression I think in response to the Trump administration.” Agustin said in Walmart’s opposition to the racial equity shareholder proposal, they cited many of the DEI policies that the company has just rolled back, and claimed the company does internal racial equity audits but has never released the results of those audits. “We’re expecting a number of co-filers on this. I think a lot of investors were surprised, shocked and disappointed to see Walmart walk this back,” Agustin said. “Walmart has a real responsibility, given its scale, to track this, disclose this, and live up to the mission that they intended when they started the racial equity center, which was to address the root causes of inequality. This is just such a slap in the face, I think to the employees and to stakeholders that care.” Walmart did not comment on the shareholder proposal or criticisms on the DEI policy rollbacks. A spokesperson said in a statement: “Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.” Advertisement Advertisement AOL AOL AOL Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement

Title: Irish Rail delays, cancellations, timetable chaos, signal failures ... what’s going on?

At 7.12am every morning, Emma-Jane Murphy takes the first train out of Connolly station in Dublin city centre to Skerries in north Co Dublin, where she works in childcare. For the first few months of the year, that worked reasonably well. She disembarked the train at Skerries a little after the scheduled time of 7.41am. An electric scooter brought her the rest of the way. Even after October 7th, when Irish Rail banned electric scooters, she had just about enough time for the 12-minute walk to work, barring delays. Since the summer, however, Irish Rail’s timetable has become so unreliable that Murphy and thousands of similar Irish commuters can no longer trust the trains to get them to work on time. “It can be quite stressful. Sometimes the train can be delayed by 20 or 30 minutes, usually in Malahide, and quite often they don’t tell you how long it’s going to be,” Murphy said. To make sure that the creche has the required ratio of staff to children, any delay means Murphy frequently has to make alternative arrangements on the fly to ensure the team has enough cover. During a major signal failure in May, she had to pay €80 to get a taxi to work, and more recently she’s had to call on her parents to collect her at the station and give her a lift. She knows such a solution is not ideal. “They have to get up early and they’re both retired,” she said, but she has no other options. [ Readers have their say: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Murphy is not alone. A survey of readers by The Irish Times found a huge volume of stories of commuters struggling to navigate an increasingly unreliable rail network, with reports of signal failures, mechanical issues, operational difficulties, delays and cancellations more than daily occurrences. Take Sorcha Morrissey, who lives in Clongriffin and commutes daily to Maynooth, where she works for a financial services company. “I started the job at the end of July, when Irish Rail was still on the old timetable, but then they changed to the new timetable – it was chaotic,” she said. It’s roughly a 50-minute journey, with the first leg on a Dart from Clongriffin to Connolly, where she changes for the second leg by commuter train to get her to Maynooth by 9am. When the trains were running smoothly, she could leave at 8.25am and still have plenty of time to get to work. But delays mean she has to leave Clongriffin on an earlier train, and even then, she is often late. The impact is just as significant on the return journey, she said. “What is very annoying about the timetable changes is that the Maynooth train back to Connolly leaves earlier now, so quite often I get into work late in the morning and I have to leave earlier in the evening.” Ethan Elliott from Wicklow said that throughout this year he has seen the service “consistently degrade”. He now presumes “at minimum, a 10-minute delay to what is advertised as the arrival time of the train”. Even then, that’s frequently insufficient, he has found. The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs Those stories are borne out by Irish Rail’s own published punctuality figures, which show a dramatic decline over the last six months. In June, Dart services had a punctuality rating of 92.8 per cent, which declined to 91 per cent the following month, then to 83.6 per cent in August, 75.4 per cent in September, and a low of 64.5 per cent in October. They have increased slightly in November to 69.3 per cent, but it’s still equivalent to three in every 10 trains missing its target time. Northern commuter services have shown a similar slide, as well as Phoenix Park tunnel and Heuston commuter services. Virtually every train coming into the Dublin area has experienced a large month-on-month drop in punctuality since the summer. The question is, why? According to commuters and experts, it appears Irish Rail is in the midst of a perfect storm: there are more rail users than ever using services at different times, putting the network under stress at different times, while an ageing fleet of trains is running at full capacity and the network’s signalling system requires replacement. “Part of the issue is that half of the Dart fleet is 40 years old, and most of the breakdowns in Dublin are Darts,” said Mark Gleeson, a spokesman for Irish Rail Users, the commuters’ lobbying group. While there are no safety issues with the trains, even a small fault, such as a failure of a door in a carriage, will require a train to be taken out of service. This has major knock-on effects for the rest of the trains on the timetable, which usually cannot be clawed back to normality once a delay has occurred. “We’re a two-track railway so there’s nowhere to pull in. If there’s a train breakdown in Germany or France, they have four tracks, so they can shove all the trains down the other tracks,” said Gleeson. Then there’s the issue of the rail signalling system, which has been the subject of a number of significant breakdowns in recent months. “The signalling centre in Connolly station dates from the 1970s, and it was extended in the 1980s to Dart. But it is outdated, it is on its last legs, and it is woefully undersized for the tasks it is meant to conduct,” Gleeson said. Irish Rail has known for more than a decade that the signalling system “is inadequate to cater for current demands”, as the company’s annual report put it as far back as 2012, while the board was still discussing the “obsolescence” of the system in 2019. There’s a more modern replacement facility in Heuston Station, but it’s not due to be up and running until 2026. Signalling system problems have become particularly intrusive in recent months, most notably on November 28th, when a large signal failure froze trains coming in and out of Dublin for hours. [ ‘I feel Irish Rail are just running down the time and hoping I will go away’Opens in new window ] Laura Farrell, who lives in Swords and travels once a week by train to Blackrock, was one of the thousands of commuters affected. She heard the announcement about the signal failure at about 7pm, so walked out to the street to catch a bus, as Irish Rail’s announcements had advised. “I figured maybe I’ll try to go down the Howth Road and try to get one,” she said, but she found the buses were jammed with passengers ordinarily on trains. She spent an hour trying to catch a bus with no success, then discovered through social media that the signal failure had been resolved, so made it back to the station by about 9pm. “I was waiting for 10 minutes on the platform for the train going to Howth, then the announcement came that the signalling was gone again,” she said. Eventually she got back to Malahide by about 10.10pm; what would normally be a one-hour commute took four hours. The problems, according to Brian Caulfield, a professor of transport at Trinity College Dublin, are symptomatic of a lack of investment in Ireland’s rail infrastructure over the last few decades – a problem that has become particularly acute because of the high volumes of people using the rail network. “We’re using the network more than we used to, and if you put that kind of pressure on any type of system it can result in faults happening,” Prof Caulfield said. Irish Rail’s figures show there were 38.5 million passenger journeys across the network in 2022, rising to 45.5 million in 2023. By some estimates, this could rise to more than 51 million this year. “It’s like trying to fit a size 12 foot into a size 10 shoe, and cracks are starting to appear because of underinvestment,” Prof Caulfield said. Multibillion euro investment is required in the rail system, he said – not just for overhauling the trains and signalling systems, but in new tracks – both light and heavy rail – and in electrification of large portions of the network. The necessary investment will not be cheap or fast, he added. “The best time to build anything is 20 years ago, and the second best time is now,” he said. Irish Rail spokesman Barry Kenny acknowledged that “the period since late August has been an extremely challenging one in terms of punctuality for our customers, for which we apologise, and assure customers we are working to address”. He blamed a numbers of factors. “The revised timetable was not operating well, and had a far more disruptive effect on northern commuter services in particular than anticipated,” Mr Kenny said. [ ‘I never know when the Dart will arrive. And Irish Rail doesn’t seem to know either’Opens in new window ] The rise in commuter numbers after Covid and the traditional delays caused by winter weather were also factors, he said, and such “force majeure” issues account for almost 40 per cent of delays. On the signalling system, he said there had been “two particularly severe faults”, but that there was “no underlying issue” and that the system was “managed and maintained”. Upgrades to both the fleet of trains as part of the new Dart+ programme and the new National Train Control Centre were “well advanced to help both capacity and performance”. Plans for expanding to a four-track line between Connolly and Malahide would allow for trains to be better managed, reducing potential congestion going into the busy Connolly hub, which is “hugely important to keep up with demand” as the population in the Greater Dublin Area increases, he said. The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at Nonetheless, he conceded that “longer-term, the congestion on the busiest corridor north of Connolly will remain a challenge”. That will prove to be a challenge for many commuters too. Elliot in Wicklow has already made the change to abandon the uncertainty of the rail network and to embrace his electric car, which will clearly add to road congestion. Nor is such transport particularly convenient for him. “The journey is probably about half an hour longer, but it’s more consistent. I know the time I’m going to get in at, barring an accident,” he said. [ Rail disruption hell: ‘There has not been one day without delays on the train’Opens in new window ] Others have no other choice. For Morrissey, travelling to work from Clongriffin to Maynooth every day, the train is her only option currently. “I’m learning to drive, but even if I was driving I wouldn’t want to drive on the M50,” she said. “The train is my only option.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish Coast Guard defends its decision over appointment at Doolin unit

Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 The Irish Coast Guard is facing criticism over the transition to the new €800m search-and-rescue helicopter (SAR) contract — and its separate handling of a management issue for the Doolin Coast Guard unit in Clare. The Irish Coast Guard has defended its decision to appoint Martony Vaughan as acting officer in charge (OIC) at the Doolin Coast Guard unit. The North Clare unit has been beset by difficulties since the death of one of its experienced volunteers, advanced coxswain Caitríona Lucas, in September 2016. A petition objecting to the recent appointment and calling for Mr Vaughan’s removal on safety grounds has been initiated by a former Doolin Coast Guard member Deirdre Linnane, and has almost 500 signatures. Friends of Ms Lucas’s husband Bernard, a former Doolin unit member now with a new separate voluntary search unit, have described Mr Vaughan’s appointment as “completely insensitive”. Caitríona Lucas who died in a sea rescue mission off Kilkee, Co Clare, on September 12, 2016 News in 90 seconds - 15 December 2024 Mr Vaughan had been OIC at the neighbouring Kilkee Coast Guard unit, which had been beset by internal difficulties in the lead up to Ms Lucas’s death. The 41-year-old mother of two was assisting Kilkee due to a shortage of volunteers when she died after a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capsized. At the November 2023 inquest into her death, the jury heard that Mr Vaughan had just stepped down from his role in Kilkee but attended the scene on the day of the incident. Kilkee’s deputy OIC Orla Hassett told the inquest she believed that its D-class rescue craft could have been on scene within 10 minutes to rescue Ms Lucas if she had enough trained crew to launch it, but Mr Vaughan had left the scene to drive to a nearby cliff. Ms Lucas had been conscious in the water for almost 17 minutes, the inquest heard. Responding to the criticism, the Department of Transport for the Irish Coast Guard said “senior volunteers will regularly take over as acting volunteer OIC during periods where the OIC is unavailable or where the position becomes vacant... to ensure the 24/7 availability of the service”. It added: “Mr Vaughan is one of a number of senior volunteers within the Doolin Coast Guard Unit authorised to act in the role of acting OIC, as he has on multiple occasions over the last number of year…and is currently acting in the role.” The department said Mr Vaughan is “a dedicated member of the Irish Coast Guard”, there have been “no findings of any wrongdoing against” him, and it would “challenge the personalised narrative” towards him. It said it retained full confidence in him and the Doolin unit “continues to provide a vital SAR service within Co Clare and wider region”. Mr Vaughan said he did not wish to comment. In a separate development, former Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds has told the Sunday Independent he believes that the timeline is “too tight” for the handover for all four SAR helicopter bases from current contract holder CHC Ireland to Bristow Ireland. Mr Reynolds said he had already tried to warn the Department of Transport of serious safety risks if a transition is “rushed”, and had offered his services free of charge to the department and Irish Coast Guard to give advice some time ago but “didn’t receive a reply”. Safety is imperative, particularly since the loss of four Irish Coast Guard lives in the Rescue 116 crash off Blackrock island, north Mayo, in March 2017, he noted. Bristow Ireland, which has been awarded the new Irish Coast Guard search-and-rescue contract, took over the Shannon base from CHC Ireland, with the first of the AW 189 helicopters this month. It has confirmed that a winchman was recently injured during a training exercise off the west coast. The exercise was part of the transition from Sikorsky 92 aircraft flown by CHC Ireland to the AW189 aircraft provided by Bristow. As the Sunday Independent has recently reported, a reference to switching SAR providers shared on an internal Coast Guard safety management system last July said timelines were “compressed”. It referred to an incident during a handover between the two operators for an Equinor contract in the North Sea where one woman died, and said that while investigators did not point to the handover being a factor, the transition was questioned and “perceived as tight”. Reynolds, who headed up the Irish Coast Guard from 2007 to 2017, said that “three months minimum per helicopter base” is required for a handover, but “they are trying to have it all done by July 1, 2025”. The Department of Transport responded that it “does not comment on ill-informed speculation regarding contract transition and must also be mindful of commercial sensitivity and ongoing legal proceedings dating back to 2023 in relation to initial contract award”. “Contract transition is progressing well and is on schedule for completion by the end of June 2025,” a department spokesperson said. Bristow Ireland said its “global experience and capabilities underpin our carefully planned approach”, and it is “ensuring a safe, phased, responsible transition to the new contract which becomes fully operational mid-2025”.

Title: Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) on Substack by Two Natural Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SRPT. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT)'s share was trading at $124.47 as of Dec 12th. SRPT’s trailing and forward P/E were 80.82 and 10.07 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A scientist carefully examining a petri dish containing a rare disease's gene therapy. Sarepta Therapeutics is a pioneering biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for rare genetic diseases, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company has carved a strong niche in the therapeutic landscape through its innovative approaches, including exon-skipping RNA therapeutics and gene therapies, addressing unmet needs for a devastating condition with limited options. Sarepta's exon-skipping treatments, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and AMONDYS 45, are designed to skip specific exons in the dystrophin gene, enabling the production of a functional, albeit shortened, dystrophin protein. These therapies have been a significant step forward, though their applicability is limited to a subset of patients with specific exon mutations. Recognizing the limitations of exon-skipping, Sarepta developed ELEVIDYS, a gene therapy approved by the FDA in June 2023, and later expanded in 2024 to treat both ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD patients aged 4 and above. ELEVIDYS addresses a broader patient population using a truncated dystrophin gene delivered via an AAV vector. This one-time treatment represents a meaningful advance, offering improved functional outcomes in clinical trials despite not achieving statistical significance on certain primary endpoints. The therapy’s premium pricing of $3.2 million per patient positions it among the most expensive treatments in the U.S., yet it is cost-effective over time compared to recurring exon-skipping therapies, which cost up to $1.5 million annually. The approval of ELEVIDYS marks a pivotal shift in Sarepta’s business model, transitioning from a predominantly recurring revenue structure to a model relying more on high-value, one-time therapies. This shift is strategic, allowing Sarepta to generate substantial cash flow to fuel innovation while maintaining a balanced pipeline. To mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on one-time treatments, Sarepta is prudently sustaining its RNA therapeutic programs and has recently partnered with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to explore siRNA-based treatments. This collaboration underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining a diversified revenue base while advancing cutting-edge technologies. Sarepta's pipeline extends beyond DMD, with SRP-9003, a gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2E), currently in phase 3 trials. Leveraging the same delivery vector as ELEVIDYS, SRP-9003 reduces development risks and exemplifies Sarepta’s effective strategy for rare diseases. By addressing smaller, high-need patient populations with scalable approaches, Sarepta maximizes the impact of its therapies while building a foundation for broader applications. Despite its leadership position, Sarepta faces competitive risks. Companies like Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are exploring CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies, while other gene therapy developers, such as Solid Biosciences and Regenxbio, are advancing candidates in early-stage trials. While competitors are years away from regulatory approval, Sarepta’s ability to maintain its edge will hinge on the continued success of ELEVIDYS, the evolution of its pipeline, and its capacity to innovate. Sarepta's balanced approach to gene therapies and recurring RNA-based treatments positions it uniquely in the biotech sector. With a robust pipeline, strategic partnerships, and a clear focus on addressing unmet needs, the company stands well-poised to sustain its leadership in rare disease therapeutics while navigating the challenges of a competitive and rapidly evolving field.

Now his re-election has sent the volatile price of Bitcoin sky-high. These days, he's known as 37244-510. Not quite as catchy as SBF, the three-letter acronym mentioned in hushed tones back when he was revered as the richest man in the crypto sphere. Sam Bankman-Fried once was the bold warrior in Bitcoin's battle for control of the future. He was the mop-top geek, the maths genius who threatened to up-end banking and finance and change the way we thought about business. In the end, he went down for the oldest and most traditional of financier foibles, stealing money from his own clients. These days, he is best known as the nerd who presided over one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. When he was finally sentenced in March this year, Bankman-Fried was ordered to repay more than $US11 billion (more than $17 billion). Had he managed to run his firm FTX like a legitimate business instead of a cash cow for his own amusement, he'd now rank amongst the world's richest after Bitcoin finally broke through the $US100,000 barrier. Instead, he's now a resident of Metropolitan Detention Centre Brooklyn, living in a dormitory cell and reportedly working on an appeal against his 25-year sentence. Given he was US President Joe Biden's second biggest donor in 2020, pumping through almost $US5.2 million in campaign contributions, an appeal for a pardon wouldn't be out of the question in the government's dying days. But now there might be another source of salvation — Donald Trump and his most trusted adviser, Elon Musk, part crypto devotee, part puppeteer. When Musk's takeover for Twitter began wobbling, Bankman-Fried reportedly offered to help finance the bid with a $US5 billion loan. And Bankman-Fried wasn't a one-party backer. He carefully played both sides of the political divide, and was a big Republican donor too, but opted to do so on the quiet because he thought the press was, as he put it, "super-liberal". "I donated the same amount to both parties," he told the Guardian in 2022. "All my Republican donations were dark," he said, referring to political donations kept off the public record. "The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to Republicans." Mistrust of the press is a sentiment that very much aligns with incoming president Donald Trump, whose sudden conversion to cryptocurrency has driven this latest boom. Trump, once a sceptic who dismissed Bitcoin as a "scam", was in good company as a doubter. Warren Buffet, considered the world's greatest investor, has described Bitcoin as "rat poison squared". "I've seen people do stupid things all my life and I really, I empathise with that, they're going to play the lottery, they're going to get 60c back on the dollar and state, the numbers racket is something to be avoided," he told CNBC last year. "I mean, people love the idea they're going to make more money tomorrow … the gambling instinct is so strong." In the past month, both the head of Australia's corporate regulator, Joe Longo, and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock have also voiced their concerns. Longo told an Australian Securities and Investment Commission annual forum that Bitcoin was a good example of "the bigger fool theory" where the goal was to simply find a buyer prepared to pay even more for a worthless asset. Bullock went further, arguing that, despite all the hype, it had no role to play in Australian society. "Don't call it an alternative currency," she said. "It's not a currency, it's not money, it's being used as some sort of asset class." "I don't understand it," she said. "But, you know, I don't really see a role for it in, certainly in the Australian economy or payments system." Devotees dismiss these criticisms, arguing Bitcoin doubters simply don't understand. But it's difficult to pinpoint any useful function Bitcoin serves. Initially, it was touted as a new means of exchange, a global monetary system that would make national currencies obsolete. Bitcoin, however, is now a teenager — a geriatric in technology terms — and after 15 years, that hasn't happened, primarily because of its volatility. Why spend Bitcoin on buying something if you think it will appreciate in value? And, as a seller, why accept it as a currency if you fear it might crash? The same goes for its role as a store of wealth. It may be at record highs right now but, as this graph illustrates, it has fluctuated wildly over time in a series of booms and crashes that have undermined its ability to be a hedge against inflation and created as much poverty as it has generated wealth. Instead, it has degenerated into a tool for speculators and gamblers. Its defenders point to the role of blockchain, the unique ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and its potential for wider business applications. That may be a legitimate argument. But it doesn't justify the mania attached to cryptocurrencies. And when it comes to investment in new technology, it has been overtaken by the rush towards artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Ironically, for all the hype that it would make national currencies obsolete, Bitcoin itself is still valued in US dollars. And those that trade it proudly measure their gains and their wealth in good, old style fiat currencies. Trump is now a true believer, promising in his usual overstated mode that he plans to transform America into "the crypto capital of the planet". The president-elect has even suggested creating a "bitcoin reserve" that could be used to pay off the country's $US35 trillion debt. To encourage that, Trump and Musk are pushing for regulation around the crypto industry to be loosened, with Musk going so far as to suggest that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be junked. The president-elect, meanwhile, recently announced he would fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, on day one. A noted critic of the crypto industry, Gensler decided he wouldn't hang around for the ritual humiliation and announced he would step aside the day Trump walked into the White House, leaving many to ponder whether the crypto industry's reported $100 million in Republican campaign funding would influence the decision on his replacement. Gensler blazed a trail through Wall Street in a bid to stamp out conflicts of interest and boost transparency, launching court actions against multiple crypto firms. What the incoming president has failed to grasp is that Gensler's actions have helped underwrite the latest surge in activity in cryptocurrency. In January, with tighter regulation in place, the SEC gave the green light for old style financiers including Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale to launch what's known as exchange traded funds that invested solely in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once approved, those funds, which ordinary investors can trade on Wall Street and on the Australian Securities Exchange, then had to load up on Bitcoin, helping drive the price higher through most of this year. Last week, Trump announced Gensler would be replaced by Paul Atkins, a noted crypto enthusiast. Unlike many of Trump's other appointments, however, Atkins is a well credentialed candidate with a background in law, years of experience in senior roles at the regulator and as a former SEC commissioner. Nevertheless, he is expected to take a less aggressive stance towards the industry and possibly review many of his predecessor's court actions. Endorsing Atkins on his own social media outlet, Trump said: "He also recognises that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before." But there is a growing disconnect between Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies and his view of the US dollar. The greenback is considered the global reserve currency. Everything else is priced against it, be it commodities like oil and metals or other currencies. That's something Trump wants to maintain as a symbol of American dominance even as he wants to retreat back into isolationism. Just last week, he threatened to penalise any country planning to shift away from US dollar dominance, aiming specifically at the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations. "We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy," Trump thundered on Truth Social. But it was the debasement of the US dollar, through money printing, huge and ongoing deficits and soaring national debt — now approaching $US35 trillion — that led to the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. Those deficits, and America's national debt, are expected to explode under Trump's high-protection and low-taxing policies, endangering his vision for "The Mighty US Dollar". Investing in Bitcoin as a national reserve to repay that debt will only further undermine the greenback. It's impossible to understate the scale of the Bitcoin frenzy which, once again, is beginning to feed on itself. The devotees now feel vindicated. The sceptics have been left bemused. Back in September, Bitcoin was trading just north of $US53,000 a token. A fortnight ago, it punched through $US100,000, sending waves of jubilation through the legions of investors, many of whom were ambushed by the downturn two years ago when it plunged to just $US16,000. Last month, more than $US10 trillion worth of digital assets changed hands on centralised exchanges as Bitcoin and its many imitators encroached even further into mainstream finance. The latest boom fortuitously has coincided with the release of Changpeng Zhao — the brains behind the world's now biggest crypto exchange Binance — from a federal prison in California. Incarcerated for four months after pleading guilty to breaching anti-money laundering rules, the man known simply as CZ once was Bankman-Fried's great rival and ultimately the architect of his downfall. But the pair were not just business rivals. Prior to the implosion of Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, they frequently clashed on the subject of regulation. Born out of a desire to overthrow the existing monetary system during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, Bitcoin's renegade mindset sat well with Zhao even after most countries declared his Binance empire off limits and outside the law. Bankman-Fried figured the opposite; that for Bitcoin and the crypto industry to truly deliver, it needed to be accepted by the mainstream and be properly regulated. Ironically, it was his FTX that bit the dust while Zhao's Binance went on to global dominance. While both this year were jailbirds, their financial fortunes headed in opposite directions. Zhao has not only maintained his fabulous wealth, he's expanded it, amassing one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. During the past year, according to data analysis from Newsworthyheadlines.com, Zhao's wealth grew more than six-fold to $US63 billion, mostly as a result of the Trump driven boom. Even his stay in prison was profitable. As the rally tentatively took hold midway through the year, Zhao added about $US3 billion to his fortune, or an estimated $US25.6 million each day he was behind bars. Who said crime doesn't pay? Then there are meme coins, which have been around almost as long as Bitcoin but have no intrinsic value, earn no income and pay no dividends. And they proliferate. Haliey Welch attracted fame midway through the year on a big night out with a girlfriend. A jovial on-camera quip about her special technique for pleasing her man was uploaded to social media and, in an instant, the Tennessee 20-something became a sensation. Now, she's attracted a fortune. A fortnight ago, the so-called Hawk Tuah Girl launched a meme coin, a type of crypto currency that doesn't even pretend to do anything useful. Within hours of the launch, the value of Hawk coin had soared to almost $500 million before suddenly losing 90 per cent of its value, wiping out most of its investors in a single day. Welch has since gone to ground. Hawk coin has been criticised as a "pump and dump" or a "rug pull" where founders spruik the value to gullible buyers and create a buying frenzy before offloading everything. The most famous meme coin is Dogecoin, created by two software engineers a decade ago, for the sole purpose of ridiculing Bitcoin. To their utter dismay, it is still around and has been a favoured trading option for Elon Musk, whose new job in the Trump administration will be to jointly head DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Driven entirely by social media hype, meme coins routinely soar and crash and, in an unregulated environment, are ripe for manipulation. "Remember when cryptocurrency was so heavily and onerously regulated, so unnecessarily scrutinised by the authorities that the whole market crashed in spectacular fashion as one tightly regulated crypto platform after another collapsed into oblivion?" "Yeah, me neither. Because that's not quite how it went, is it?" Jemima Kelly, a columnist for The Financial Times posed this question in a piece late last month that injected a dose of reality into the current debate over Bitcoin and regulation. When the market for cryptocurrencies crashed two years ago, what was exposed in almost every case was a web of deceit and incompetence, aided by loose or non-existent regulatory oversight. Operating outside the finance industry mainstream, consumer protection and even licensing became an ad-hoc affair and, when the inevitable crash occurred, it hit hard. Two years ago, they were falling like dominoes. FTX, Celsius, Tether, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Terraform, Luna. They all hit the skids, torching countless billions of dollars of investor cash. The crashes were replicated around the world. Here in Australia, Blockchain Global, a cryptocurrency exchange, went under as funds and digital tokens disappeared. In almost every case, the story was the same. Investor funds were plundered for other purposes, often plugging holes in other parts of the leaky structure. Often, they were used for personal largesse. Despite the cloak of rebellion under which many hide, those running these outfits operate in much the same fashion as financiers and banks have done for thousands of years. They clip the ticket on transactions, charge fees for storage and gouge commissions at every opportunity. Both Bankman-Fried and Zhao created their empires in this very traditional manner. Financial institutions, whether they be traditional banks or cryptocurrency exchanges, thrive during periods of exuberance. Commissions on trillions of dollars of transactions adds up pretty quickly into handsome fees and huge profits. Not surprisingly, there has been a sudden roar from those very crypto ticket clippers, some predicting Bitcoin is now on a trajectory to push past the $US1 million mark. The not so subtle message is: "Better get on board now." Mike Mangan discovered gold around the turn of the century. Rattled by the dotcom bust and concerned by America's plunge into money printing to boost its economy, the Sydney-based former investment banker, stock analyst and funds manager turned to investing in the oldest form of wealth or, more specifically, those who mine it. Gold, he explains, is a hard asset, a relatively unique metal because of its resistance to corrosion, it's malleable nature, visual attractiveness and its scarcity, all of which contributed to its use in coinage and jewellery, dating back thousands of years. "It has a history, and history and reputation are so important when it comes to finance," he says. That goes a long way to explaining why gold trading dwarfs the Bitcoin market. But Mangan empathises with Bitcoin devotees, many of whom were left disillusioned by the near collapse of capitalism during the global financial crisis, and their search for an alternative. "I wouldn't underestimate the cognitive dissonance of people wanting to find an alternative in a system they believe is going to hell,'' he explains. The rise of Bitcoin, he says, "reflects a loss of confidence in the monetary system". While global currencies no longer trade on a gold standard, most countries, and particularly China in recent years, continue to amass gold as a store of wealth. America hasn't added to its gold reserves at Fort Knox for years but it holds the biggest reserves of any country by a long shot. Like Bitcoin, gold too has punched through to record levels in recent months. Unlike Bitcoin, its rise has been steady during the past 20 years, providing a perfect hedge to the degrading of the US dollar and to inflation, as this graph in US dollars shows. It also doesn't easily evaporate, as cryptocurrencies often do. And if in any future global conflict power systems and electricity grids are fried, the ability to retrieve a virtual asset — one that doesn't physically exist — will be compromised. "Cryptocurrencies were supposed to be all about protecting yourself from a world in chaos," Mangan says. "But if the world does descend into the kind of dystopian future many fear, what happens to your Bitcoin?"

Title: China’s Money Helicopters And The Contrarian Trap

US dollar cash money flying against sky clouds background We income investors don’t talk about international stocks nearly enough. That’s too bad, because there are ways we can use them to build a massive income stream and make our investments safer, too. In fact, there’s one way, using high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs), we can “time” US and international stocks to get a 9.2% yield we can build over time by making simple moves to “rebalance” between US and overseas CEFs from time to time. It all starts with China, because there’s a spark there that sets the stage for our 9.2%+ overseas payout strategy. Lost in all the talk around tariffs is the news that China announced a new stimulus package. Details won’t be known for a while, but the news boosted Chinese stocks. Even though China hasn’t spelled things out, the package will likely resemble the quantitative easing we saw in the US in the 2010s (in response to the subprime-mortgage crisis) and 2020 (in response to the pandemic). Both packages paid off for US investors, with the S&P 500 gaining 13.0% annualized in the five years following the first stimulus move and 84% in the two years following the pandemic-driven move. The post-2020 gain stemmed from US stocks crashing and then quickly recovering in a once-in-a-century event, so let’s set that aside. Which leaves us with the question of whether Chinese stocks could rise by a 2010s-style 13% annualized clip for the next half-decade. To answer that, we first need to note that Chinese stocks have dropped nearly 50% since their 2021 peak, providing a seemingly good entry point for a contrarian investor. We also see some bouncing back as China acknowledges the need to prop up its economy, again suggesting a good entry point. Since we’re CEF investors, we might look to tap into this with a fund like the China Fund (CHN), whose 16.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this makes the Chinese assets it holds even cheaper. Unfortunately, CHN has been getting cheaper despite the recent boost to Chinese stocks. Again, this sounds like an ideal setup for a value investor, but it isn’t. Fact is, we’ve seen this movie before. In the past, China’s attempts to stimulate its economy didn’t do much. In 2016, following a crash in its stock market, China’s government tried to prop up assets, and that did drive a 21.7% gain over the following year. But since then, the Chinese market has posted a 3.5% annualized return, as the stimulus couldn’t overcome the disadvantages of a closed, substantially government-controlled economy. Kudos to CHN for outperforming the index, but its talented managers could only squeeze out a 5% annualized return over that time. That’s not a lot better than a much safer high-yield savings account in America. Still, with the recent run-up in US stocks, it’s a good time to add some international exposure. But we’re not going all-in on China. Instead, we’re going to hedge our bets on the country with a more diversified international fund: the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in my CEF Insider service. BGY Outperforms This chart speaks volumes. While CHN (in orange) and Chinese-stock benchmark MCHI (in purple) are down in the last five years, BGY is up an annualized 7.4%. Plus, BGY recently announced a hike to its monthly dividend and will yield a high 9.2% annualized, based on the new monthly payout, so investors have essentially gotten their entire return in the form of dividends. With that in mind, we can make timely shifts between US and international stocks, potentially enhancing our safety, gains and income as we do. Let’s say we pair BGY with something like the all-American Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA). When US assets fall, you can take your payouts from BGY and put them into USA. You can also do this in the other direction, using USA’s high dividend (9.9% as I write this) to invest in overseas stocks when they’re down. This way you’re maximizing your diversification and building a huge income stream. That beats what many investors do: Buy an international ETF that yields little, and a similarly low-yielding US fund. The result? Volatile price swings from both—and no way to rebalance frequently without selling your shares and trying to time the market. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: US lawmakers warn about ‘climate cartel’

Time Published: 2024-12-14T13:43:00Z

WASHINGTON - A US House of Representatives committee says it has found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behaviour” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG goals” on American companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp board members in 2021 after the oil company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote in the report titled “Sustainability Shakedown”. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon, led by a firm called Engine No. 1, coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false”, said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so”. Last month, the fund managers BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by forcing up electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process”. Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov 27. The judiciary committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the Republican Party’s attacks against the practices.

Title: BlackRock's bond chief Rick Rieder oversees $3 trillion. Here are 2 of his favorite investments right now for high yields.

It's getting harder for investors to find the kind of robust yields on cash equivalents they could collect earlier this year. With the Federal Reserve expected to have slashed interest rates by a full percentage point by the end of the year, returns on vehicles like money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-end Treasurys are dipping. But there are corners of the fixed-income market where investors can find yields that offer an attractive premium over benchmark rates, according to BlackRock's CIO of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder. Rieder, who oversees $3 trillion, shared with BI this week a couple of his favorite areas of the fixed-income market at the moment to find higher returns. One is AAA collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, which are a group of bonds packaged together in the same instrument. The AAA part of their name signifies that they're high quality, or investment grade, and have the lowest default risk possible. AAA CLOs "trade at a 120 basis-point spread to the SOFR curve," Rieder said, referencing projected secured overnight financing rates (SOFR), which track closely with the fed funds rate. "That gets you a lot of yield as a AAA asset. That is one of my favorite sectors today." Second, he likes European credit, both investment-grade and high-yield. High-yield bonds are viewed as riskier assets but offer better returns. Because the euro is stronger than the dollar, the effective yield that European bonds offer is higher when they're converted back to US dollars. They're also appealing because European firms' creditworthiness has strengthened, thanks to lower debt levels after the pandemic, he said. "As a US investor, you get an extra 150-ish basis points from buying those assets," he said. "And if there's one unique thing around credit today, it's that post-COVID and around COVID, these companies termed their debt out, so they have no debt coming. So I like being a lender in Europe, and I like owning equity in the US." Rieder is betting on both European credit and CLOs through the exchange-traded fund he manages, the iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC). Combined, they make up 39% of the fund's holdings. BINC has performed impressively since launching in May 2023, bringing in $6.7 billion in assets under management and delivering an annualized yield of 5.9%. $2.2 billion of those inflows took place during the third quarter this year, the most of any active ETF in that time, according to BlackRock. Rieder said the fund achieves this return in part by bundling high-yield (and therefore higher-risk) bonds with investment-grade bonds. The average rating of the fund's holdings is BBB+, putting it at the bottom of the investment-grade range. That's just under the 6% yield offered by the ICE BofA US Corporate BB Index, a high-yield bond index. But he also said the flatness of the yield curve — or the uniformity of yields across various durations — allows his fund, with an average duration of 2.5 years, to take advantage of strong returns without having to buy longer-term assets. Most of the time, investors are compensated with higher yields for locking up their money in longer-duration bonds, making this "an extraordinary point in history," Rieder said. "You don't have to take risk longer out the yield curve, and you can own things like AAA CLOS, AAA mortgages that are super high-quality and blended with other assets," he said. "It's been a couple of decades since you could do that." Rieder said the interest rate environment would likely be "static" in the near future if inflation remains sticky and growth stays strong, as these conditions would prevent the Fed from cutting very much on the short end of the yield curve and investors would continue demanding elevated yields for longer durations.

Title: Bitcoin – Here’s how mining stocks and Spot ETFs are fueling a market shift

The declining ROI on Bitcoin mining stocks is having an impact too. At the heart of the Bitcoin [BTC] network are miners with major BTC holdings. In today’s volatile market, keeping track of their reserves is more crucial than ever. Interestingly, the amount of BTC held in miner wallets has dropped to a yearly low of just 1.809 million. While factors like rising mining difficulty, breakeven expenses, halving, and reduced rewards are often blamed, there may be a deeper shift at play. This shift could be eroding miners’ influence over the market as more investors flock to alternative investment vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, Bitcoin’s network risks becoming more centralized, raising the question – Is this a step forward or a setback for Bitcoin’s decentralized future? A year after the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a game-changer, eliminating the need for financial middlemen. Over time, it has built a passionate community of ‘believers’ who see BTC not just as a digital asset, but as a powerful symbol of decentralization. It’s no surprise that miners play a key role in making this vision a reality. In the 15 years since Bitcoin’s creation, individual miners have evolved into large companies, now holding significant amounts of BTC themselves. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is leading the way, with over 40k BTC in its reserves. While this is bullish for Bitcoin – driving up accumulation – it also signals a troubling trend – The growing centralization of mining power, now controlled by just a few key players. The plot thickens as investors increasingly turn to mining stocks as an investment tool, closely tied to Bitcoin’s price. When Bitcoin drops, these stocks follow, leaving investors with losses. Source : Ecoinometrics on X As ROI continues to shrink, more investors are pulling out, forcing mining companies to either sell off their Bitcoin holdings or shut down. This dynamic, in turn, directly or indirectly impacts Bitcoin’s price, adding yet another layer of volatility to the market. A closer look at the chart above revealed an interesting pattern – The expected returns on Bitcoin holdings didn’t play out the way mining companies anticipated, particularly as Bitcoin neared the $100k mark. In a typical scenario, this would have caused mining stocks to surge, attracting new investors eager for a slice of the action. And yet, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has been on a steady downtrend, signaling a shift in a market that demands deeper exploration. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have made it easier for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually owning it. This new investment vehicle removes the complexities of wallet management and mining. In fact, on the day the “Trump pump” began, $1.3 billion in inflows were recorded into Bitcoin ETFs. Clearly, these newer players are quickly outpacing traditional mining stocks, offering a “less risky” route for investors eager to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Read Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025 But here’s the catch – This shift isn’t without its risks. As big institutions like BlackRock (IBIT) scoop up huge amounts of BTC, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is starting to feel the strain. In fact, at last count, BlackRock held a staggering 530K BTC. With such large players in the mix, their influence on Bitcoin’s price is undeniable. Investors need to stay sharp, exercise caution, and keep a close eye on their holdings moving forward.

Title: Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Joe Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the act, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.

Title: Why Is Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Among the Best Income Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 16 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other income stocks. When it comes to income investing, dividend stocks are often the first choice for investors. These stocks offer regular payouts to shareholders, which are seen as a way to steadily increase income over time. This approach is backed by data. A report from Hartford Funds revealed that dividends have accounted for 39% of total returns on average since the 1940s. The report also highlighted that stocks with high dividend payouts have not only outperformed other dividend-paying stocks but have done so with lower volatility. Income factor plays a crucial role in investing, as it can significantly boost overall returns, helping investors achieve the portfolio growth needed to meet their financial objectives. A study by Eagle Investment Management highlighted the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the returns of a hypothetical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the Dividend Aristocrats Index—composed of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for 25 years—with the broader market, assuming dividends were reinvested. According to the report, by 2022, the $1,000,000 investment in Dividend Aristocrats would have generated $93,212 in income, compared to just $55,726 from the market. This stark difference emphasized the greater income potential of dividend aristocrats over the broader market. Although this is a historical example, it underscores the importance of not only prioritizing dividends but also focusing on their growth to enhance a portfolio's income stream over time. Also read: 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024 Dividend investing is not a quick path to success; it requires patience and a long-term approach. Over time, high-yielding dividend stocks tend to outperform those that don't pay dividends. According to the French Data Library, while non-dividend-payers may lead the market in certain years, they generally fall short in the long run. Dividend-payers, especially those with higher yields, have consistently outperformed non-payers and even the broader market. The report, which examined returns from 1927 to 2023, found that non-dividend-payers delivered an annualized return of 8.7%, while high-yield stocks returned 10.9%. In comparison, the overall market returned 9.7% during the same period. The report outlined several reasons why dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform others. According to the report, investing in dividend-payers helps filter out the most speculative stocks, as these companies are usually well-established and confident in their cash flow, allowing them to return cash to shareholders. Moreover, dividend-payers are more commonly found in the value segment of the market, and stocks with lower prices and expectations have historically performed well. Dividend payers often build a loyal shareholder base, as investors relying on income from their holdings are less likely to sell due to negative news. Lastly, committing to paying dividends fosters discipline within companies. Executives, tempted by the prospect of using excess cash for acquisitions or speculative projects, are instead compelled to act cautiously and prioritize maintaining dividend payouts. For this reason, investors tend to focus on companies with a proven history of strong dividend growth and high yields. In this article, we will further take a look at some of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we screened for stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of December 13. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Upside Potential as of December 13: 23.4% An American multinational telecommunications company, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ranks third on our list of the best dividend stocks. In addition to analysts' projections of an upside potential of over 23%, CMCSA also remained popular among elite funds in the third quarter of 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. 72 funds held stakes in the company in Q3, growing significantly from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.44 billion. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) posted $32.07 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, marking a 7% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The company demonstrated solid performance, with broadband ARPU increasing by 3.6% and a 5% rise in its connectivity segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Connectivity & Platforms division reached 40.9%. Additionally, Comcast successfully hosted the Paris Summer Olympics, achieving significant growth in Peacock's revenue and subscriber base, while reinforcing NBC's position as the leading network for the 2023-2024 season. Despite reporting strong earnings, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is down by nearly 9% since the start of 2024. The company’s performance has been underwhelming, offering little incentive for investors to engage this year. The results were seen as a short-term boost rather than a sign of sustainable growth, leaving investors unimpressed. That said, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) maintained a solid cash position from a dividend perspective. In the latest quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and reported free cash flow exceeding $3.4 billion. Furthermore, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, cementing its status as one of the best dividend stocks on the list. The company has been growing its dividends for 16 consecutive years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. As of December 13, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.11%. Overall CMCSA ranks 3rd on our list of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Kevin Power: I took a deep dive into Irish literary magazines and would do it again without hesitation

This November I undertook, voluntarily and for pay (as David Foster Wallace once put it), to read as many Irish literary journals as I possibly could, and to write a report on the state of operations in this particular corner of the culture industry. A supposedly fun thing. Will I ever do it again? The stacked mags made a foot-high pile on my desk. It was imposing. It was downright frightening. The titles, assembled, made an attractive word salad, or perhaps a short experimental poem: Tolka, Ragaire, Banshee, Southword, Sonder, Splonk… Herewith, my lit-mag vibe check, in two parts. Part One (this week) will focus on the nonfiction stuff. Part Two (next week) will be all about fiction and poetry. The lit mag scene being what it is, there will be a certain amount of bleed-through between these categories, the blurring of forms and genres often being what a good contemporary lit mag is all about. Caveat lector. So, what did I read, on my journey through the stack? I read a lot of not-great poetry. Some of this not-great poetry was sort of identity-politics-based, by which I mean that I read a lot of poems about people’s grandmothers making ethnically significant food. Here’s my rule about poetry: the sort of thing that you might want to write a poem about is the sort of thing that you must never write a poem about (your grandmother, your feelings, the winter solstice). I read a lot of psychoanalytic material, imperfectly transformed into fiction. I read about a lot of bad relationships. I read a lot of stories and essays that didn’t quite make it clear where and when their key events were taking place; the effect was confusing. I also read a lot of surprising and original work by surprising and original minds. Would I do it again? You betcha. [ Irish literary magazines: from the visually stunning to the unapologetically plainOpens in new window ] So: the nonfiction journals. Brace yourselves. I’ll start with Holy Show, edited by Brendan McEvilly and Peter McNamara, which appears annually and is the most visually sophisticated (ie attractive) of current Irish lit mags. Its concerns are “Contemporary Irish Life and Art” and it knows that you can’t, or shouldn’t, have one without the other. Therefore it publishes prose pieces alongside art or photographs that speak to them, or vice versa. There is no fiction; criticism is criticism of visual or plastic art. The current issue, number 6, begins with an essay by Caelainn Hogan (author of Republic of Shame) about Mega Dreoilin, “a 16-bit game about Ireland’s housing crisis” made by the artists Han Hogan and Dónal Fullam and exhibited at Pallas Projects/Studios in the Liberties. No mere review this, but engage journalism: personal, passionate. Hogan and Fullam are deeply concerned about the housing crisis, which, they point out, has been artificially generated by vulture funds and landlords operating in cahoots; Hogan takes us to squats and evictions, to parts of Dublin where “Locals [don’t] feel any protection from authorities” where, “with State policy offering little protection,” people “are always one step away from homelessness”. It’s difficult to imagine such an uncategorisable piece of political-journalism-slash-art-criticism about Irish social issues appearing anywhere but in a small literary journal; indeed, pieces like this are one big reason why we should have small literary journals in the first place. This might be as good a time as any to note that almost every lit mag in Ireland is funded, in whole or in part, by the Arts Council. A good reason to pay taxes, if you ask me. The online-only “journal of ideas” Dublin Review of Books (drb.ie) has been a going concern since 2007; edited by Maurice Earls and Enda O’Doherty, and linked osmotically to Books Upstairs on Westmoreland Street, it publishes “long-form essays and shorter pieces, in both cases usually tied to recently published books” and it does so in a new issue thrice yearly. There is no point in me pretending to objectivity about the DRB, since about 60 per cent of my most recently published book is made up of stuff I wrote for the site. But perhaps if I say that I write for the DRB so much because the DRB a dream to write for – catholic in its range, hospitable in its editing – then this will suffice as its own comment. DRB contributors tend to be academics or experts, writing on highbrow subjects for a general audience. The current issue (October 2024) is indicative. It features Anthony Roche reviewing Brian Friel: Beginnings by Kelly Matthews – an essay that doubles as a lucid and compassionate mini-biography of the playwright; Sam Enright on a lecture delivered at UCD by John Maynard Keynes in 1933, touching on “the predicament of how newly independent nations should develop”; and a long, deeply informed review by Kevin Stevens of Percival Everett’s Booker-shortlisted novel James. All of these pieces will repay your time and study. As someone once remarked of the DRB’s older American cousin, the New York Review of Books, reading any given issue is like taking a term of courses at a good university. [ The website that liked books so much it published oneOpens in new window ] Like its cousin, the DRB hardly cleaves to literary or historical topics. It is one of a tiny handful of places in Ireland where you can publish, and read, longform considered reflections on issues of urgent national import. In the current issue is Toy Story, an essay by David Blake Knox. This is ostensibly about the lack of oversight, and the sheer managerial hubris, that resulted in RTÉ losing €2.3 million on Toy Show: The Musical. But really, and most subtly, it’s about how a certain section of Irish society thinks about itself, and how it thinks about Ireland. In telling this particular story in tones of calm sanity and with a forensic eye for detail, Blake Knox, a former RTÉ producer and one of the few people to actually see Toy Show: The Musical when it ran to empty stalls in the Dublin Convention Centre in 2022, does something important: he shows us that one of the traps lurking in Irish public life in the 2020s is a sense of smugness, of self-regarding complacency (aren’t we great, altogether? Sure why would we change?) It has to do with money, of course, this feeling; the thing that made us fall in love with ourselves, when it first landed in our bank accounts back in the late 1990s. Blake Knox shows us that the RTÉ scandals of last year have been misunderstood, and that instead of eating popcorn while we watched poor Ryan Tubridy sweat, we might have done better to see these events as a general warning about how some serious defects in our national self-understanding. In publishing pieces like this one, the DRB is performing a real public service. The editors know this, of course. The tag for Blake Knox’s essay is “Public Service Broadcasting”. [ The best Irish-language books of 2024, another bumper year for all agesOpens in new window ] Tolka’s mission statement commits it to “formally promiscuous nonfiction” which more or less puts it bang in the mainstream of highbrow writing in the 2020s (almost everyone with an MFA, these days, is writing formally promiscuous nonfiction, often about being informally promiscuous). Physically, each issue of Tolka is a gorgeous object; lined up together on a shelf, the white spines are satisfyingly uniform, linked by a little black wave pattern suggesting the Dublin river after which the journal is named. Tolka’s contents, thank goodness, are not at all uniform. Issue 8 kicks off with And No Animal is Without Enemy, a viscerally disturbing personal essay by Megan Nolan (author of Acts of Desperation and Ordinary Human Failings). “Don’t be angry if I tell you that it is the aim of my life to get people to look at me,” this essay begins, but it is not about attention-seeking; it is about self-mutilation, both physical and psychological, and it hinges on a casual hook-up with a lawyer in Hampstead arranged via “a popular fetish site”. It appears to be an excerpt from something longer – a memoir, perhaps? Issue 8 of Tolka also contains Quietly the World Shifts, an essay by Noreen Masud about her involvement in the Fossil Free Books movement’s campaign to get Baillie Gifford, corporate sponsor of book prizes and festivals, to “divest up to £5 billion from fossil fuel companies and from companies profiting from Israeli occupation and genocide in Palestine”. Masud’s question is, “How do we act rightly when there is no reward, neither in the present nor in an imagined future?” Her piece – hopeful, angry – offers one answer. A mention for Declan Toohey’s Bombs Away: Blitzkrieg Notes on Gravity’s Rainbow, also in Tolka Issue 8; this is literary criticism (in this case a response to Thomas Pynchon’s paranoid 1973 masterpiece) as kamikaze warfare – not quite a self-destroying essay, not quite a hallucinatory short story, not quite a transcribed fever dream; formally promiscuous, indeed. [ Books in brief: From the Irish man who invented the penalty kick to an injustice in HullOpens in new window ] Back when I was starting out as a writer, 20-odd years ago, there were only two big lit mag games in Dublin. There was the hospitable and spunky The Stinging Fly, then in its larval stage, and there was The Dublin Review, which seemed too scarily austere to submit to (and still does). Edited, since 2000, by the redoubtable Brendan Barrington, The Dublin Review now looks like an Irish institution. But this is only because it consistently delivers the goods, if by “the goods” you mean superb work by writers old and new. Literary agents who know what’s good for them read The Dublin Review; austere it may seem, but it’s also, no gainsaying it, the place to be. The Dublin Review’s preferred mode is the personal essay, though it also publishes short stories: the current issue, number 96, contains good ones by Sorcha Hamilton and Fiachra Kelleher. The standout piece, however, is a personal essay by William Keohane. It’s called The Assessments, meaning the assessments undergone by Keohane as he sought to begin the process of gender transition, and it’s a masterful piece: clinical, observant, coldly passionate; and speaking clearly to an audience larger than the writer himself, as too many personal essays are not. That’s your nonfiction lot, lit-mag fans. Stay tuned – next week, it’s fiction and (non-grandmother-based) poetry. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 During Mad Money’s episode, Cramer noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) market cap touched $100 billion in 2024 and said: “Micron, semiconductors, does high bandwidth, 18%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Micron (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, and manufactures memory and storage products, offering high-speed, low-latency semiconductor devices and non-volatile memory solutions. The growth of AI is expected to play a significant role in the company's future expansion, particularly in the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI servers. The company has projected that the total addressable market for HBM will increase substantially, from around $4 billion in 2023 to over $25 billion by 2025. On December 10, Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce has finalized a $6.1 billion subsidy for the company, intended to support the development of several domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This investment, which was originally announced in April, is one of the largest government awards to semiconductor companies under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.

Additionally, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and the Commerce Department have reached preliminary terms for an extra $275 million investment aimed at expanding the company’s manufacturing facility in Manassas, Virginia, which produces chips primarily for the automotive, networking, and industrial markets. Overall MU ranks 1st on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of financial advisors huddled around a desk, discussing the best investment strategy for their client. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Calling Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) an anomaly, Cramer noted that the stock has returned 45%. “You want [an] anomaly? Hey, how about Citigroup with a total return of 45%, enough to finally let it sneak into the hundred billion-dollar club. Not bad, it’s part of the failings of banks that are finally getting their due.” Citigroup (NYSE:C) is a leading global financial services firm that provides a wide range of financial products, including cash management, trading, and investment banking services. According to CFO Mark Mason at the Goldman Sachs 2024 U.S. Financial Services Conference on December 10, the company is on track to meet the high end of its revenue forecast for 2024, which is between $80 billion and $81 billion. He highlighted that net interest income, excluding markets, has exceeded expectations for the year. While the bank expects its expenses to be near the upper end of the initial guidance, Mason anticipates positive operating leverage extending into 2025 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees are expected to increase by 25% to 30% compared to the previous year, and Markets revenue is projected to rise by a high teen percentage. Mason also noted that equities, particularly prime balances, continue to show strong momentum. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key priority for the company, and Citigroup (NYSE:C) aims to complete $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, with $500 million already repurchased. Overall C ranks 6th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of C as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Weekend reading: Managing the less obvious risk in a 60/40 portfolio
URL: https://monevator.com/managing-60-40-risk/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T03:18:37Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. Was there ever a rationale way for investors with a 60/40-style equity/bond portfolio to avoid the worst of the government bond rout of 2022? It’s a question that still bothers me. As a writer and an investing blog owner, mind you, not on my own account. I didn’t own any bonds going into 2022 as an active investor. I’d felt gilts looked a poor risk-reward proposition for years. But fret not – this isn’t a brag… I found plenty of other ways to lose money in 2022. Indeed it was my worst showing on a relative basis in my investing lifetime. However I didn’t own any government bonds. Which meant at least I didn’t suffer the indignity of seeing the supposedly ‘safer’ bit of a portfolio do worse than if I’d gone all-in on stocks. As I wrote in December 2022 in my recap of that woeful year: Vanguard’s popular LifeStrategy funds have put in a Bizarro World performance: This is the opposite of what we’ve come to expect from balanced funds like LifeStrategy. And let’s be honest – it sucks. True, the pain of 2022 has made government bonds investable again. That’s a genuine upside. However for anyone who owned a lot of government bonds before the rout, such a silver lining must feel a bit like when your house burns down and at least you get the chance to plan a new kitchen. Whenever I reproach myself for not writing more about the risks of government bonds on very low yields, my co-blogger The Accumulator reproaches me in turn – by reminding me we did! Long-time Monevator readers may recall such classics as: Also, I did fret openly about a potential government bond crash – way back in 2015! Indeed – and even more tellingly – I first worried government bonds were getting overvalued in 2008, when the financial crisis was still raging and safety was a first resort. As things turned out, the ‘low’ yields that spooked me then – yields which at the time had not been lower since World War II – still hovered above 3%. Bond yields had far lower to go in the years ahead. In fact, gilt prices continued to climb inexorably – and hence their yields fell to near-zero – until 2022, when suddenly everything reversed. So precipitous was the subsequent plunge that the iShares core UK Gilts ETF (ticker: IGLT) is still underwater compared to when I first fretted about low yields in December 2008! IGLT is a distribution fund. Its price doesn’t include the return from dividends. But even if you’d reinvested your income from IGLT, the 16-year gains are puny: Source: iShares Over the same period a world equity tracker multiplied your money nearly six-fold. That’s not so much an opportunity cost as an opportunity catastrophe – unless of course you’d been prescient enough to sell your bonds in 2020. But that’s hindsight speaking. We didn’t know for sure that the world wasn’t headed for another Great Depression in 2008 – or something even worse, if the ATMs had failed and all the banks went bust. And even as yields fell further over the following 14 years, it still seemed futile to bet against bonds. Yields would just be lower again the next year, and you’d be left with egg on your face. The best a strict passive investor could probably do was to reduce their government bonds to a tolerable minimum and hold more cash (and other assets) instead. But remember that for years that would have been a poor trade. The return on cash was nearly nothing. Yet bonds remained a decent investment, delivering steady returns well into the Covid era. Our model Slow & Steady Passive Portfolio, for instance, outperformed our expectations for a 60/40 portfolio for years, in large part thanks to those relentless gains in bonds. So where does all this looking back leave us as we ponder the future? Well, arguably it’s all moot. It’s one thing to say that perhaps there was a case for even a passive investing purist ‘market timing’ away from government bonds when the ten-year yield danced towards zero – and the expected returns from inflation-linked government bonds went negative. But that isn’t where we are now. And there’s no reason to think we’ll see the like again in the next 50 years. Those near non-existent bond yields were probably a special case. In contrast, fiddling when the yield on the ten-year falls to 3.5% and you’d bought at 4% might be the stuff of a lucrative day job on the prop desk of an investment bank. But everyday investors will surely to do worse for such tinkering… …or will they? I’ll conclude with some interesting research shared by Jim Paulsen a couple of weeks ago on the U.S. flavour of a 60/40 portfolio. For his purposes, Paulsen1 defines the ‘cost’ of holding a 60/40 portfolio as being how much it would lag a 100% equity allocation over any particular period. This cost – in terms of foregone returns – is the price you pay for the lower volatility and downside protection of holding government bonds, with their guaranteed return of capital and knowable returns. Digging into the numbers, Paulsen found that the cost has previously soared when the yield on a ten-year US Treasury bond falls below 4%: Source: Paulsen Perspectives There are probably two reasons for this observation over this period. Firstly is the one Paulsen focuses on. When bond yields are low, you’re not getting compensated as much for owning government bonds in terms of income. On an inflation-adjusted basis, you might not be making money at all. But secondly, I suspect there’s an equity timing signal buried here. When government bond yields are very low, it’s probable people are more fearful than usual. They’ve likely bought government bonds for safety, presumably in part with money that could instead be invested in shares. In that case equity valuations may be depressed – implying potentially higher returns from the ’60’ part of the portfolio going forward. Whatever the reason, Paulsen suggests the 4% yield level could act as a trigger for US investors to look again at their asset allocation should the ten-year US treasury yield fall below 4%. Rightly he doesn’t suggest wholesale abandonment of a diversified portfolio, writing: The 60/40 balanced portfolio makes sense for many investors and there is no reason to abandon balanced management even if the 10-year Treasury yield does decline again below the 4% trigger. However, 60/40 investors may want to consider occasionally altering the balance mix depending upon which side of the Trigger they find themselves. If you generally are a 60/40 investor, perhaps you could adopt the simple rule of being 50/50 when above the yield Trigger and switching to 70/30 when below the yield Trigger. Depending on each individuals’ risk tolerance, this ‘toggle approach’ may not be appropriate. But for those balance investors who may want to try and take advantage of the 4% Trigger and keep the ‘relative cost’ of balanced management reasonable, adjusting the mix slightly around the toggle may prove profitable, perhaps as soon as in 2025. Finally I’d note that Paulsen’s backwards data dive only ran to 1945 (when, as I said above, bond yields were last very low) and also that this is US data, with its rip-roaring equity gains to greatly plump up the ‘cost’ side of the equation. Still, food for thought. Especially if yields ever do descend into the depths again. Have a great weekend.

Thanks for all the wisdom and thought provoking posts over the last year, and best wishes to you and all Monevator readers. My view is that it is very important from a passive investor to focus on yield and to probably buy gilts direct. Then you can pick the yield for a given duration. Buying gilts near 5% to 2055+ means you can hold forever at an okay return. Buying at 0.5% or not getting a long term on a 1% mortgage is risky not being smart by being passive. Think it applies to equities too though which makes Asia UK, Europe etc lower risk but S&P and world indexes high risk. If you are being passive just check the yield on everything. The change to Vanguard’s fees is annoying. I have around 12k in a SIPP there, and am unlikely to add any more anytime soon, as I’m in a public sector job with a good DB pension, so ISAs just make more sense as a savings vehicle for me. Which means Vanguard has basically just tripled my platform fees. Time to move, I think. Probably to DODL? I already have my lifetime ISA there, and would rather not have too many of my eggs in one basket. But doesn’t seem like there’s a great range of options for small SIPPs atm. 60/40 – for a long time the one-size-fits-all for financial planning isn’t fit for purpose – much like my own years of over investing in the stagnant FTSE100 (bond like super tanker company, dividend aristocrats who only occasionally mess up). But reading Simple Living (and his last post is great) mentioned that his own bond allocation was probably served by his Final Salary pension. That spurred me into a more “risky” approach of pretty much going all in for global ETF trackers(in part to drive down fees). So the future of me and bonds… I could always payoff the mortgage at 4.45% ( thanks Liz) but I would rather leverage and invest in equities instead. Yes, very disappointing from Vanguard. Supposedly one of the ‘good guys’. Investengine have in the last few days approved transfers in to their platform-fee free SIPP. But only from Vanguard (see what they did there?) . And they only do ETFs and I don’t think they can handle in-specie. I’d recently convinced a young, self employed relative to start putting something away into a Vanguard SIPP. This move from Vanguard puts her fees up from about £2 a year to £48. Looks like Investengine will work for her instead. It’s an odd move by Vanguard to punish young investors at the start of their investing careers. You’d have thought they’d want to retain their custom throughout their investing career. Throw in the fact that fees on most of their passive offerings are around 10bps more expensive than comparable offerings and I’m beginning to lose a bit of faith in Vanguard. Thanks for yet another batch of interesting links and thoughtful commentary. The Madrid Metro article makes fascinating reading and is quite timely given the UKs increased centralisation of planning decisions as announced recently. Another thought provoking discussion regarding bonds. I’m currently with Vanguard and from a quick look don’t believe I’m affected by the fee increase. One word of warning however, regarding moving to another platform is the customer service that Vanguard provides that some platforms don’t. They have been very good with several queries that I’ve had over the years. Liked ‘The Wire’ quote- there are numerous ones of wisdom in that show! Season’s Greetings to all at Monevator and their readership. Lee. As someone who buys government bonds directly and holds them to maturity, I couldn’t care less how their price moves. I know what yield I will get, and I made the decision to buy them at that yield. The problem isn’t that yields can fall. It’s that inflation can rise. If that happens my real yield will fall. I have some index linked gilts for that, but of course their yield is a joke. Then again I knew this when I bought them. The risk from a 60/40 portfolio, therefore, is really inflation. That’s why it doesn’t really matter if you think bonds are overvalued – it matters if you think inflation is underestimated. I have a family member who has a tiny amount in a Vanguard ISA (well under the 32,000) so they are going to have to move. It seems like either Dodl or Invest Engine are the ones people are thinking about? One more vote of confidence in InvestEngine from me – their customer service were very helpful in producing the exact statement my compliance department needed, and the service itself is a pleasure to use. They have a swap based S&P 500 tracker, a physically replicated World Ex US ETF and an Emerging Markets ex-China ETF, as well as offering cost free rebalancing, so you can build a cost optimised All-World ETF from Finumus’s recipe despite not having a high invested amount. https://investengine.com/share/portfolio/2bad7a83414d7700cde20b822ccfce922c7280f0/ The only thing that worries me is what their business model is – is payment for order flow enough? I just checked Hargreaves Lansdown’s website and I cannot see any offer for cashback when transfer a SIPP. How new/old is this offer? Thanks. Thanks @TI for Vanguard heads-up. Mrs 2MY has Vanguard SIPP a little below the £32k (and missed the T&Cs email!). When she retires this time next year, TFLS plus very slow drawdown topping up SP to TFA will make an increasing difference. Annoying as they’ve been very good in all other respects. Additional fees will be marginal for the next 12 months so inclined to keep a watching brief; noting IE not slow to make a grab! Anyone have experience of IE in drawdown? Their website goes a bit quiet on this. I don’t think Investengine offer drawdown (not yet at least). I only know this as I was looking to start a SIPP myself this week and almost opened a Vanguard one the day before they announced the fee change! The Behavioural Investment 2025 Forecast roundup was absolutely brilliant — good find! But fun aside, while most of Monevator’s readers likely don’t share my soft spot for Jamie Dimon, I must say, his musings on inflation (as seen in this interview https://youtu.be/bI1TL3svaGs?si=kA_IJOI6E-FwWMwk) aren’t completely daft. Love him or loathe him, keeping an eye on inflation might be a 2025 prediction worth taking seriously. Still, more funnies from Behavioural Investment, please — it really made me chuckle. I just had email confirmation from Investengine. They can accept in specie SIPP transfers, assuming they offer the exact same product as Vanguard. Which they will if you’re in ETFs. Im still not clear if they can accept partial in specie transfers if you have holdings in a mixture of funds and ETFs. My assumption is that you can but I did not confirm. I bought into L/S 40/60 in2017 (I was nearing retirement and was looking for a safer plan) last year and this I would have done better in a local Building Society . Oh dear. @David 15 What numbers/dates are you using? If I use something like the Royal London short term money market fund as a proxy for cash interest rates, then from June 2017 to date I get: LS 40 – ~28% LS 60 – ~48% RL short term- ~13.2% The 60/40 portfolio gets extensive discussion on the Bogleheads forum and American financial blogs generally (I notice the videos of the latest Bogleheads meet are in the links this week) The conclusion seems to be for those American investors using a total stock market index for their equities and bonds -this asset allocation ie 60/40 -then held for ever through thick and thin -the results have been good-certainly better than equivalent actively managed portfolios Most stockmarket drops of course have been on the equity side but the stockmarket has many twists and turns -predicting and then the escaping these oscillations seems to be difficult-impossible? U.K. investigators like me have also managed to to do reasonably well copying this 60/40 allocation albeit with a global equity and bonds held for their portfolio (Should just have held American equities and bonds?) A U.K. investor with a 60/40 portfolio with a built in U.K. bias will have done less well Another conclusion seems to be that 60/40 is a fairly arbitrary choice and variations between 30/70 to 70/30 have done similarly well -the choice depending on the investors attitude to risk ,volatility size of portfolio etc “Staying the course” seems to be the other essential ingredient xxd09 @Jon Snow — Hmm I agree, it’s not there now. I’m sure it was there and valid last night! I haven’t included them in the links for ages, and only brought them back for this deal. Also I pulled the 10 January deadline info in my blurb off their promo. Actually that date a clue perhaps that they they have withdrawn it…the short time window to complete the application implies a limited ‘budget’ allocated to new transfer incentives. I wonder if they are somehow getting overwhelmed with Vanguard exiles? Doesn’t seem super likely though, as they are not a straight swap in terms of cost profile by any means. Thanks for the heads-up! 🙂 @all — Just to add, I am hopeful that @TA is going to be able share some thoughts on Vanguard and if/where to move as soon as Monday or Tuesday. So please watch this space, and as always the comments under his article. 🙂 I’ve got a lump of VGOV bond ETF in my SIPP, still underwater. Risk rating 5 and paying 4% dividends. I also have VHYL High Dividend Yield equity ETF risk rating 6 paying 3% dividends. The VGOV plan didn’t work as expected to “smooth the ride”! I can’t bring myself to crystallise the loss – hoping it may improve if interest rates ever come down some more. Yes, I need to look into direct gilt holdings. When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out. The one thing going for Vanguard I think is they won’t be sold into private equity if that is a concern. I started a SIPP with them but found transfers in very slow, gave up with it and consolidated more with HL. It is actually cheaper for me to hold Vanguard ETFs with HL too. I hope the slow transfers with Vanguard have improved if they’re upping their fees. @Jon Snow – I can see the HL SIPP cashback offer registration here https://www.hl.co.uk/features/register-cashback-pc Register by January the 10th. If you’re a customer and have issues, call them. They’re very helpful. About moving from Vanguard to Investengine, you are moving from a global sized company to a really small company who had yet to make a profit. It’s not always about saving a few pounds it’s about the big picture. As for availing of the HL cashback, they are on course to delisting from the London stock market to disappear into a private equity buy out. It is of course your money your choice. @GF The same thought had occured to me about moving my SIPP from Vanguard to Investengine, and am currently tempted by the Fidelity SIPP which is only £90 a year if you use ETFs. However is the change to HL likely to make it detectably more risky – either way it is a huge (and too big to fail?) UK broker? @Ben Ber. I struggle to see how private Equity can improve HL. When I open up my PE play book then the way to go is put a lot of debt on the balance sheet. Cut as many staff as you can and generally squeeze as much as you can relying on HL customers unwillingness to move. I just can’t see them going for all out growth, squeeze the cash cow is the most likely choice. @TI 60/40 went through the wringer in 2022, but it should be rather better placed to deliver now vis a vie 100 equity. But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? The WisdomTree Global Efficient Core UCITS ETF has recently been listed on the LSE in both USD (NTSG) and GBP (WGEC). 0.25% p.a. OCF. Your getting a 90% global developed markets equity tracker, but with 60% high quality developed world bonds thrown in. 1 ETF for implementing Lars’ 2 asset class solution, but without giving up 40 to make room for gov. bonds. @GF & @Ben Ber: On HL and PE: it’s hard to know how much (or how little) to be concerned. A known unknown. There were some articles here on MV in recent years about UK broker protections, but (IIRC) it was not exactly a greatly reassuring picture. We haven’t (yet) had a 2007/8 moment for fund platforms, like we did for the retail banks. The big practical issues are where, when and how to move. 90% logistics, only 10% strategy. For all its drawbacks, HL are still only £45 and £200 annual platform fee caps respectively for ISAs and SIPPs (nowt for GIAs) for holding ETFs, ITs, individual shares and gilts (notwithstanding the extortionate 0.45% p.a. headline rate for holding OEICs). Their customer service remains OK (but used to be great) with fairly prompt responses to secure messages and a UK phone line. OTOH, the HL FX rates and £12 dealing fee are steep, and look like something a late 1990s stockbroker would charge. Their selection of ETFs is also not as broad as you might think and there can be issues buying certain ETFs and ITs. If it weren’t for the PE buy out I’d stay put, but there’s that uncertainty to try and parse now, and there’s also lot of choice and switching incentives these days. The HL offer appears to be by invitation only: “Subject to these terms and conditions, if you have been invited to take part in the Transfers Cashback Offer (October 2024 – January 2025)…” “To be eligible for the Offer, you must: have received a communication from Hargreaves Lansdown inviting you to the offer” @BillD (#31): Re: “When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out.” Yup, that is what I thought the email might say – and it is how Vanguard (V/G) have built their business. I do wonder if JB had still been around if this would have happened? I just so happen to currently have several a/c’s (with different providers) that meet the criteria – albeit they are not with V/G. So, it is not just greenhorns that may be impacted. Had these a/c’s been with V/G (which some of them nearly were) it would not have effected me, due to my other V/G holdings. However, given how much V/G take off of me for those other [buy & hold] holdings I think the changes are actually pretty shameful! Is this just the latest sign that things are not so good with V/G in the UK, or V/G more generally? IIRC, in the UK they dropped cash interest rates and took some missteps with an advised offering. @tetromino @all — Re: HL, thanks for the extra info, I’ve removed the promo from the article as it’s really not clear what it’s up to. The HL cashback is offered on the front page only if you’re logged into the account it seems or maybe have a cookie from a previous login. The invite on the front page should count as “a communication from HL”. So I guess you need to be an existing customer, all very strange they’re not using it to attract new customers?! I saw some comments on another site that Vanguard are changing to taking the direct debit charges monthly rather than quarterly but see no mention in their email? Maybe it’s just if you’re hit with the £4 charge for having a “small” holding. I don’t have a good feeling about them. I think the Paulson study is a great bit of insight. I think, though, it is asking something like “when should you put bonds in the portfolio you will spend from in over 20 years, to stabilize it without hitting the return too badly” – hence the comparison against just 100% shares which would usually be the default buy for your very long term savings. In particular, it’s not saying: “when the risk free rate drops below 4% at some point in 2025, you should dump all the bonds you hold for nearer term use”. Well, it might mean if your 1y bond gets a 2% boost from next year’s cuts you should swap it to cash, I suppose, but not to shares! To @Delta Hedge >But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? isn’t it just a big increase in risk & fees? :- put 60% in bonds paying 4%+ coupon; spend all the coupon servicing a 50% loan; put the other 40% and the borrowed 50% in shares; the return is: the return on 90% shares plus from the bonds we’re just getting the “carry” if the risk free rate falls or losing if it rises. So isn’t it better to buy 90% shares and 10% in the 50-year gilt to get the same carry, plus I keep the coupon and lower fees? (- which would indeed be a long term portfolio benefitting from containing bonds, which Paulson says is likely a good idea assuming the gilt pays over 4%) @Meany #31: I thought the same initially. The key difference is these products, unlike ‘traditional’ daily reset ETFs, use rolling 3 month futures to get exposure to the lower risk and hopefully negative correlation (bonds) asset. The high risk asset (stocks) is held physically and unlevered. In the comment thread to @Finumus’ Leveraged ETFs for the Long Run, posting under my old moniker @Time Like Infinity and as @DH, I’d reached the same conclusion as you for the old school type 2x and 3x leveraged ETFs with daily reset, and concluded there’s each of a significantly bad volatility drag, an interest rate drag, and an interest rate sequence drag to contend with when rates are high (there’s very little research on this last one online, but what there is suggested that 10 year US Treasury bond yields below 4% was a decent threshold below which to consider old style 2x and 3x leverage with daily reset if you had the stomach for it – obviously as Paulson notes lower rates also tend to mean equity outperforms as well). These capital efficient or returned stacked second generation (and now calendar reset third generation) of leveraged ETFs are quite different beasts. They don’t do the borrowing in the same way (rolling 3 month futures used for exposure to a negative correlation low volatility asset – bonds – for second generation, and longer rebalance periods in third generation). Here’s a review of NTSX ETF which in the UK is WTEF ETF and is 90/60 S&P 500 plus intermediate duration US Treasury bonds: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/ The key bit is “cheaper to lever up bonds than stocks, and by using futures on a bond ladder, they’re not using daily-reset leverage usually seen with leveraged ETFs, so no volatility decay to worry about, and we’re also largely avoiding counterparty risk, as bond futures markets are highly liquid. Even Bogleheads seem to like it for all these reasons.” And here’s a review the same day from the same source on return stacking generally: https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/return-stacking/ Disclosure: I invest in WTEF, and it’s held its own very well so far against an S&P 500 only tracker SPXP, which I also own, since launch 14 months ago. MV commentator @MrBatch is quite into these products too IIRC, and his comments are worth consulting here. Returning to the 60/40 question, I get the impression that the message should be ‘duration, duration, duration’ as in, make sure your duration fits your circumstances. Even with some basic bond knowledge in place, it’s so easy to underestimate the difference between IGLS (gilts of duration 2) and VGOV (gilts of duration 10). I think the main benefit of individual gilts is one of transparency: the process of buying an individual bond forces you to choose exactly how much duration you want. Great post about risks of the 60/40 in the current environment. Thanks TA! Odd Lots had Nouriel Robini last week (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PlZdOVFngsk) and he talked about these risks as well. He mentioned the possibility of the FED eventually being forced by Trump’s inflationary policies to effectively move the inflation target from 2% to 5%. This would then push the Treasury yields gradually up resulting in substantial losses for long duration Treasuries. He discussed changes to the 40% defensive part of the 60/40. Instead of the usual longish duration bonds, a much more diversified defensive 40%: short duration bonds, inflation linked bonds, gold, and property in places that are less likely to be affected by the worst impacts of climate change. I’ve been doing a similar sort of 60/40 with 60% of my portfolio for years (since the time of subzero interest rates). The remaining 40% of my portfolio is basically a 70/30 where the 30% is a mixture of a 10% allocation to gold and 20% to short duration bonds and short duration inflation linked bonds. This allocation has worked well for me. My 10 year annualised return (measured over this investment period rather than just estimated based on the current allocation) is a bit higher than 12%. Guardian Fantasy House Hunt has appeared after the strike https://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2024/dec/14/homes-for-sale-with-an-air-source-heat-pump-in-pictures We held a 60/40 portfolio right up until 2020, when we moved to 90/10, with the 10 in cash. I had been concerned about falling yields for a while, but in 2020 bonds were offering risk with next to no reward. At the time cash was offering higher returns with no downside risk. I would not have concerns about bonds now and have largely gone back to gilts. I am more concerned about equities than bonds, but there aren’t any sensible alternatives in the way there was with bonds. We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities. @Naeclue (#36): Re: “We will reduce some of the risk in the new year by buying a couple of RPI linked annuities.” I can see that logic – as it locks in [some of] your [real] gains to date. Couple of thoughts: a) that nice regular income stream could limit some of your options – esp. if you are worried about income tax [rates] and fiscal drag. Hence my Q (at last post) about a deferred annuity? b) over annuitizing is/can be wasteful “UK economy shrinks again in October, official figures show” At least some of that must be the relentless gloom and doom about the budget and economic outlook, not just from Labour’s opponents but led by Kier Starmer and Rachel Reeves. I was surprised to learn that the small business I’m involved with will pay less employers NI next year than this: the rate will go up but the “employment allowance” will be more than doubled. For those not familiar, this allowance means that a small business doesn’t pay the first 5000 £ of employers NI, and from next year , the first 10,500 £. That represents quite a lot of of wages in a small business. OK, we’re being shafted in multiple other ways, but if this was say a George Osborne budget you can bet he would have headlined this measure & praised it to the skies as the solution to the UK’s economic problems and the birth of golden age for small businesses, while keeping quiet about the other stuff. Are RR & KS just inept politicians ? Do they think they need to present the budget as a full-on, pip-squeaking budget to their Party left-wing (especially after the Winter Fuel Allowance fiasco) ? A few recent news items about cost control and even job cuts in the civil service are interesting in this context….easier for Labour to get those away if they can claim they have pushed soaking the rich as far as possible & still have a crisis in the Gov. finances ? @Anna — Good spot, thanks! @Al Cam, we will not be buying large annuities, less than half our expected annual expenditure, but it will give us some explicit inflation protection. I will have a look at deferred annuities as well. Certainly worth thinking about as we don’t need the income right now. Friends and relatives I have known who have made it into their 90s typically spend next to nothing, unless in care homes, even when they are very well off. If we make it that far our annuities may be all we need. Delaying a year has worked out well with shares up about 20%, but that could easily reverse, so we should probably sell soon once we have a firm plan.. I missed the bond rout in the sense that I avoided the “return free risk” of government bonds, although I have endured some collateral damage to my green energy infrastructure trusts which have taken something of a battering. What limited bond holdings I did have 2-3 years ago was short dated stuff. I have been gradually building my fixed income allocation over the last 2 years and will continue to do so. This includes a blend of everything from shorter dated corporate bond ETFs to an individual 15 year gilt. My work pension choices are more limited so split between a gilt fund and a corporate bond fund. So I’m balancing gradually through new contributions rather than dumping equities – where I might only add to via dividend cash reinvestment within my SIPP. But anyway, it isn’t rocket science to see that a gilt yielding 4.5-5% is going to help you drawdown at 4-5% a lot more than a gilt yielding 1%. I can see why some people might choose to lock in for 20 years or more at today’s rates. But I’d also still want to hold at least 2 years spending in cash/short dated gilts/money market funds. @Naeclue (#40): Good stuff. FWIW, completely share your [equities] valuation concerns. Re DA’s, see for example: https://monevator.com/the-slow-and-steady-passive-portfolio-update-q3-2024/#comment-1841096 and subsequent reply It’s been the case for many years that the yield priced into conventional gilts has been less than the interest rate on best buy fixed rate savings accounts of equivalent term albeit the margin has narrowed on occasions. The current 5 year gilt spot rate is about 4.03%pa (spot rate is the theoretical zero coupon return). And yet the best buy 5 year fixed rate savings account offers about 0.5% more at 4.52%pa (it’s 4.18%pa for an ISA account). If it was 0.5%pa difference for say 20 years then investing in gilts rather than in best buy savings is (ignoring any practical issues such as being able to go the savings route) almost equivalent to giving away 10% (= 0.5% x 20) of your money for no reason. Above 5 year term there is usually no direct savings comparator to gilts. But even if we magically assume they suddenly represent good ‘value’ (whatever that means) at those longer terms, there is a serious risk of unexpected future inflation eroding their value. So at a time where the real returns on equities reduce during that high future inflation period, we see the conventional gilts hit as well. It is also interesting to note that the real returns on index linked gilts have recently increased from about minus 2.8%pa (on say 20 year terms) in November 2021 to about plus 1.5%pa now. But implied inflation (which is the gross yield implied by the price of conventional gilts less the real yield on equivalent term ILGs) has hardly changed, currently about 3.3%pa vs 3.8%pa at November 2021 at a 20 year term. What that tells you is that conventional gilts have until recently been priced to give negative real returns. It’s just with index linked gilts it was completely obvious this was the case as you could see the negative real return implied by the prices. With conventional gilts you had to make the logical step of saying at the very low gross redemption yields baked into prices, inflation was likely to exceed those low yields causing expected future real returns to be negative. The only protection those conventional gilts could ever have provided would be during a significant period of negative inflation. So it’s reasonable to assume that conventional gilts might now offer some future real returns especially at the shorter terms while watering down risk, or at longer terms if inflation doesn’t rise above expectations or is below expectations. Personally I think index linked gilts especially at around the 20-30 year term (if that coincides with when you might need the proceeds) offer good value to water down risk or provide a secure income floor. But the (high) inflation risk of longer term conventional gilts is significant and at shorter terms best buy savings accounts offer better value. I’ve recently purchased index linked gilts but I’ve never bought conventional gilts preferring savings as a means to water down risk. @Snowman – great post.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cramer has liked Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) for some time now and recently commended its CEO, saying: “Last but not least, we've got a cybersecurity company that CNBC investing club members know all too well called Palo Alto Networks, up 37%... Big deal for Palo Alto, a huge journey undertaken by CEO Nikesh Aurora…” Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most recognized cybersecurity companies in the world, providing a comprehensive range of security solutions aimed at protecting organizations from the ever-changing landscape of digital threats. The company recently reported strong financial performance for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, surpassing consensus estimates and raising its guidance for the full year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company generated $2.1 billion in revenue, marking a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. Its EPS rose by an impressive 77%, reaching $0.99. The company's next-generation security services, which are a key area of growth, saw its annual recurring revenue surge by 40% to $4.5 billion. Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) also highlighted a notable increase in the size of customer deals. The number of customer accounts spending over $1 million on its cybersecurity platform grew by 13% year over year, reaching 305 accounts. More significantly, the number of accounts spending over $5 million saw a 30% increase, growing at an even faster pace. Overall PANW ranks 11th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PANW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A technician working on power management in a semiconductor factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 Cramer noted that as of last Friday’s close, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock was up 11%. “Analog Devices, that's internet of things, up 11%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) designs and manufactures integrated circuits, software, and subsystems, offering products for data conversion, power management, amplifiers, radio frequency ICs, and micro-electromechanical systems. The company recently reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue of $2.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Adjusted EPS stood at $1.67, also slightly above estimates. However, the company saw significant year-over-year declines, particularly in its industrial segment, which dropped by 21% in the quarter and 35% for the fiscal year. CEO and Chairman Vincent Roche acknowledged these challenges, attributing them to unprecedented customer inventory pressures. Despite this, he highlighted the resilience of the company's business model, which allowed the company to maintain operating margins above 40%. During the earnings call, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) management emphasized the company's ongoing focus on research and development, which contributed to the double-digit growth in its design win pipeline for fiscal 2024. The company also mentioned the momentum in its Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, particularly in sectors like GMSL, healthcare, and data center power. This progress is seen as a crucial step toward the company’s goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue synergies by 2027. Overall ADI ranks 12th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ADI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A financial analyst looking at the news, analyzing the trends of the insurance market. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Talking about Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), Cramer noted that the insurance business is “on fire”. “... Not to mention insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, that's up 20%. The insurance business is on fire and we know from these egregious CPI numbers, one comes out this Wednesday, they just keep raising rates. These three are winners for certain.” Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) is a professional services firm offering advisory and solutions in risk management, strategy, and people-related areas, including insurance and reinsurance broking, analytics, and strategic consulting. On December 11, RBC Capital analyst Scott Heleniak raised the rating on the company stock from Sector Perform to Outperform, with a revised price target of $250, up from $242. The firm considers Marsh a "high-quality insurance broker" with strong visibility into robust sales and earnings growth through 2025. The company's diverse business mix offers stability, making it less vulnerable to fluctuations in property and casualty pricing as the cycle progresses. RBC anticipates that the McGriff acquisition will enhance Marsh's position in the middle market and finds the stock's valuation appealing, as it trades at a discount compared to some competitors. In November, Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) announced its acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services for $7.75 billion, as the industry prepares for increased business spending on policies amid a stronger economic outlook. The company stated that the deal, made through its Marsh McLennan Agency division, is expected to strengthen the unit's offerings in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, management liability, and personal insurance. Overall MMC ranks 13th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

(NYSE:PLTR) is favored due to its high-profile government contracts and the buyers’ belief in it to reshape the U.S. defense budget. “Next up is an enterprise software company, Palantir, which exploded on the scene this year with some big contracts and some big growth. Palantir came public via direct listing in 2020. It kind of hung out doing nothing until its sales finally took off and then man, this thing was just a rocket ship. Palantir is the brains behind much of the military that we don't know about. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a developer of advanced software platforms and is known for its work with government agencies. Earlier in the year, it secured a $480 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the Maven Smart System, set to be completed by 2029. In November, it also partnered with Anthropic and AWS to offer U.S. agencies access to Claude AI models, enhancing data processing and decision-making capabilities. More recently, on December 9, the company expanded its contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a one-year, $36.8 million deal to support the Mission Command System (MCS) and enhance technology for U.S. Special Operations Forces globally. The deal includes deploying AI capabilities and fast-tracking software deployment using Palantir's Ontology Software Development Kit. Additionally, on December 6, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) announced that the company and Anduril Industries are launching a consortium to help the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence, focusing on developing infrastructure to transform AI advancements into next-generation military and security capabilities. The partnership aims to address two main challenges: data readiness and processing data at scale. To tackle the latter, they will use Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) for cloud-based data management and AI development, meeting both commercial and national security needs. Overall PLTR ranks 17th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer highlighted that under the leadership of its CEO Rene Haas, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stock has roared and its market cap reached $100 billion in 2024. “We are having a tough time getting IPOs to market, which means the ones we do get tend to be priced too low thanks to a paucity of buyers and that's what I think happened with the stock of Arm Holdings, the semiconductor architecture company that's partnered with Nvidia for all sorts of gizmos and it's all over the cell phone and servers too. Arm’s growing incredibly fast and CEO Rene Haas has steered the company's stock to an 87% return, joining the hundred billion dollar pantheon.” Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializes in designing and licensing central processing unit technology and related components. Rather than manufacturing chips itself, it generates revenue through licensing its processor designs and collecting royalty fees from companies that integrate its technology into their products. With the rise of advanced technologies like AI, the company expects to see increased demand for its chip architectures, as the complexity of chips grows to accommodate these emerging technologies. In line with this trend, the company reported significant growth in its licensing business. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company had secured 39 Arm Total Access licenses, up from 33 in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of Arm Flexible Access licensees increased from 241 to 269, reflecting a broader adoption of its technology. This expansion in licenses directly correlates with increased royalty revenue, as the chips created using these licenses are sold and used in a variety of devices and systems. Earlier it was disclosed that Nvidia's largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), which it failed to acquire due to an antitrust issue two years ago. Additionally, CEO Rene Haas, highlighted a shift in the company's business model, explaining that in the past, it would have seemed unrealistic for Arm to charge $100 per system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, with its pricing now set between 50 cents and $1 per core, Arm is generating over $100 per SoC when multiple cores are included. Haas pointed out that this new pricing structure reflects the growing value of Arm's technology in the burgeoning AI and cloud computing sectors. Overall ARM ranks 18th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pantera Capital Founder Projects Bitcoin Market Cap To Soar To $15 Trillion
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-bitcoin-market-cap-15-trillion/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T00:30:02Z
Full Content:
Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital Management, has reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could eventually command a $15 trillion market cap. Morehead’s comments came during a recent interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” where he also highlighted Pantera’s original Bitcoin fund surpassing a 1,000x return since its inception in 2013. According to Morehead, institutional exposure to crypto is still woefully inadequate. He notes that “the median institutional ownership of blockchain is zero,” and even trailblazing investors typically hold just 1–2% of their allocations in digital assets. He characterized the opportunity as massive, citing that “95% of financial wealth has no investments in blockchain whatsoever,” which translates to minimal overall exposure—often a fraction of a percent. Reflecting on the early days of crypto, Morehead recalls years of unclear regulations deterring institutions from making meaningful commitments. With Donald Trump to take office, he envisions more supportive frameworks for digital assets, hinting that the US government could mirror its early internet-era strategy: “93% of the [crypto] market cap is based outside the United States,” he said, underscoring the need for domestic regulatory clarity. When asked about the possibility of President-elect Trump establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Morehead commented: “I think there are two versions of that. One is that the president-elect said he will not sell the Bitcoins the US already owns. The United States owns 1% of the world’s Bitcoins. That seems easier to do than getting passage to buy additional Bitcoins. I think it is a great strategy. The US is the reserve currency of the world. We don’t have another currency to save our reserves in. So saving in Bitcoin would be a great strategic move.” Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric gains, Morehead believes there is room for further growth, especially as many large investors remain skeptical. He recounted raising only $1 million during 170 investor meetings in 2016—an experience that reinforced the notion that widespread adoption was still years away. Now, with mainstream financial giants offering Bitcoin, Morehead no longer worries about BTC price going to zero. “50 million people in the US, 300 million globally own it. Blackrock and Fidelity are selling it. It has reached escape velocity,” Morehead remarked. Looking ahead, Morehead outlined a vision of BTC’s market cap reaching $15 trillion, with the price per coin potentially rising to $740,000: “It has gone up three orders of magnitude since we launched our fund, I think it can go up a fourth. And that puts it at a $15 trillion market cap, which still seems relatively small compared to $500 trillion of financial assets. That’s doable.” In a recent investor note, Morehead revealed that BTC could reach this target as early as April 2028. At press time, BTC traded at $100,000.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges. Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile an initial list of top telecom stocks to invest in. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:T) is a global leader in telecommunications and technology, offering services across two segments: Communications and Latin America. The Communications segment provides wireless, wireline, and broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US, while the Latin America segment focuses on wireless services in Mexico. The company experienced robust growth in 5G subscribers during the third quarter, adding 403,000 postpaid phone net additions, which was achieved with a decrease in churn and upgrade rates. This performance translated into an increase in Mobility EBITDA, exceeding the full-year guidance by reaching a growth rate of over 6%. Mobility EBITDA grew by $600 million year-over-year, reaching $9.5 billion, driven by a 4% increase in Mobility service revenue. This strong foundation sets the stage for continued success in the fourth quarter, with the anticipated seasonal factors expected to fuel growth further. AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE:T) focus on 5G subscriber growth is a key driver of its overall success. Overall T ranks 2nd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of T as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than T but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a global provider of communication, technology, and entertainment services. Operating through its Consumer and Business segments, it offers a range of products and services, including wireless, wireline, FWA broadband, IoT solutions, and more. The company serves consumers, businesses, and government entities with a focus on delivering innovative and reliable solutions. The company has demonstrated strong success in the fixed wireless access market, surpassing the initial target of 4-5 million subscribers 15 months ahead of schedule, as of Q3 2024. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) plans to double its fixed wireless subscriber base to 8-9 million by 2028. This goal will be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy that includes aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave technologies to enhance coverage and capacity, the introduction of innovative solutions to serve multi-dwelling units with high-speed internet, and continuous R&D investments. Third Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall VZ ranks 3rd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(Azoria) Bradley Devlin / @bradleydevlin Bradley Devlin is politics editor for The Daily Signal. Send an email to Bradley. During his first term, President-elect Donald Trump took to calling Mar-a-Lago—the 62,500-square-foot, Spanish Revival-style mansion that doubles as a private club and Trump’s private residence—the Winter White House or the Southern White House. That Mar-a-Lago is again the Winter White House probably makes Marjorie Merriweather Post, the breakfast cereal heiress who built it in the 1920s, smile from beyond the grave. Upon her death in 1973, Post donated the residence to the National Park Service, hoping one day that the compound would be used as precisely that. As Trump has been the center of gravity of American politics for nearly the past decade, the right’s most politically connected are frequently seen orbiting Mar-a-Lago and, more broadly, Palm Beach, Florida. Washington creatures aren’t the only ones seen on the club grounds these days, however. Over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump brought anti-woke entrepreneurs and financiers into the fold. Mar-a-Lago’s clientele reflects as much. Not only is Trump’s club the Winter White House, it might also be called Winter Wall Street. But Mar-a-Lago’s business-oriented guests aren’t the establishment types—the likes of Roger Altman or Reid Hoffman. They’re often young and ambitious. They’re plugged into crypto and artificial intelligence. They’re embracing the values of Trump’s America First movement and now they’re looking to capitalize on it for themselves and their investors. Take James Fishback, for example. The 29-year-old hosted a breakfast Dec. 5 at Mar-a-Lago to announce the launch of Azoria U.S. Meritocracy, an exchange-traded fund. Azoria ETF, co-founded by Fishback and Asaf Abramovich, friends who met in college, will refuse to put its investors’ dollars into the hands of corporations that implement quota-hiring systems in the name of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. In other words, Azoria ETF has been described as “an S&P 500 fund without the woke s–t.” “We’re here today for one simple reason,” Fishback said in his remarks at Tuesday’s Mar-a-Lago event. “America’s greatest companies have long thrived on a straightforward yet powerful principle: Hire the best person possible for the job.” “That’s how these companies became engines of innovation that have delivered windfall profits to shareholders and changed the world in the process,” he said. “In recent years, however, many of these companies have been captured, infected by a new orthodoxy that rejects the time-tested principle of meritocracy,” Fishback continued. “They’ve instead embraced something new and toxic: hiring on race and gender.” “These companies that end up earning subpar returns by running their businesses like a Model U.N. tournament as opposed to a profitable enterprise,” he told the crowd. Azoria has identified three dozen companies in the S&P 500 index that have publicly admitted to racial and gender hiring quotas. “These three dozen companies,” Fishback said, “span different industries, from tech, health care, financials, consumer goods, and more. They employ over 3 million people and have a combined market cap of nearly $3 trillion.” Despite their differences, they all “share one critical flaw,” Fishback said: “They reject meritocracy in favor of forced diversity, and their returns are suffering as a result. Year to date, a portfolio of these anti-meritocratic companies has returned just 12% compared to the S&P’s 30[%].” Expand the time span to the past three years, and the chasm only gets wider. “Over the past three years, the anti-meritocratic bunch has returned 17[%] compared to the S&P’s 60[%],” Fishback said at Mar-a-Lago. “And this isn’t just one or two stocks holding down the index. It is the fact that this is a widespread, systemic issue. Over the past three years, 70% of these anti-meritocratic companies have underperformed the plain old S&P 500.” Fishback’s Azoria not only will seek to secure higher returns for investors by refusing to invest in corporations with hiring quotas. It also will frequently lobby companies and corporations to abstain from or abandon woke hiring practices. Azoria’s first target for change: Starbucks. The Daily Signal had the opportunity to speak to Fishback more about Azoria’s potential impact. “We’re going back and forth with Starbucks as we speak right now,” Fishback said. “The fact that they are engaging with us at this level means that we have the facts on our side.” “We’re not trying to micromanage [these corporations]. We’re drawing a line in the sand, and that line is if you hire on skill or ability, you’re in; if you hire on race and gender or anything else, you’re out,” he told The Daily Signal. “And so that means the 500 companies in the S&P 500 get reduced down to about 465 as a result.” “The premise is really simple,” Fishback continued. “Companies that hire on skill will outperform those that hire on race. For folks who want to purge their portfolio of those anti-meritocratic underperformers, they should see a better performance than simply investing in an S&P index fund from the likes of BlackRock.” While Azoria aims to ensure great returns for its investors, for Fishback and Azoria’s supporters, it’s about more than just money. It’s about a broader restoration of American principles to the nation’s private and financial sector. Hiring quotas are “a rejection of the values that made America great and a perversion of sound business practices in America,” Fishback explained at the Mar-a-Lago event. “The color of your skin and the body you were born into have absolutely nothing to do with what you can bring to the table.” The work Azoria will do is a foil of what Trump’s movement, Make America Great Again, has done for American politics, he suggested. “President Trump won a historic landslide [because] … Americans of all walks of life sent a resounding message. And the message was also one of rejecting the toxic divisiveness, the toxic politics of saying that one race needs special treatment over another,” Fishback told the crowd. “We’re going to deliver on this mandate in the private sector,” he said. “We’re going to look to President Trump’s leadership and what he’s doing in the public sector. Both of us are going to be, I think, successful—just a question of who gets there first.” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, also featured at the Mar-a-Lago event, said Trump’s victory and the emergence of enterprises such as Azoria are a testament to the fact that Americans “have far more similarities than differences.” “It seems that that’s really the operating thesis for Azoria,” Roberts said. “That from Starbucks to whatever the next company you’ll be involved in may be, that you’re simply trying to restore this balance to the American investment marketplace.” In recent years, the American Right has become hyperfixated on the need to create alternative institutions. It’s no surprise this effort has coincided with Trump’s time on the political scene, given how institutions—business, media, finance, or governmental—have organized and attacked not only Trump but his supporters writ large. The Right’s creation of these parallel institutions already has paid dividends, especially in the media space. But creating an alternative media institution is one thing; the barriers to entry are relatively low. Creating an alternative financial institution is another thing entirely. Fishback and other innovators in this space face their own unique challenges. Nate Fischer, founder and CEO of the investment company New Founding, told The Daily Signal that one such challenge is inherent in the financial industry’s current structure. “I’ve argued that DEI is in many ways a natural ideology for managerial organizations,” such as financial institutions, Fischer said. “If you’re just touching something narrow like DEI, you may be offering a product that’s not sufficiently differentiated.” Fischer wasn’t implying this was specifically the case with Azoria, but a challenge that any alternative financial institution faces given the current structure of the finance industry. “And if the evolution toward ESG, DEI, etc., is a natural outgrowth of the model of business and finance that we have embraced, it’s very difficult to go against that tide,” he said. “The general challenge to building alternatives is you need to reinvent,” Fischer said. “You need to invent something new, and that’s hard. It needs to be new and it needs to have an actually differentiated risk profile. There needs to be something doctrinal, from an investment perspective, about the difference and I think that’s crucially important.” Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, told The Daily Signal that these challenges are especially pronounced in exchange-traded funds. “ETFs are a very scaled game because the fees have to be low,” Krein said. “So you got to have a lot of assets, and it’s tough to get high AUMs [assets under management] when you’re a new fund without a track record and without a lot of the big infrastructure.” Meanwhile, he said, other big financial and consulting firms will petition the same companies to stay the course on their nonmeritocratic hiring practices. “There are a ton of statistics out there that show more diversity leads to greater returns. It seems a little dubious that it would just be so perfectly aligned like that,” Krein said of the statistics peddled by these big corporations. “The issue is that why are they going to listen to you when you have, you know, $100 billion in your ETF, versus BlackRock and the others that have trillions of dollars in their ETF? Your statistics better be really good.” Fischer said he believes the barriers for alternative financial institutions to break through are twofold. “One is, it’s a risk-laden space,” Fischer said. “You create a financial product, and you’re asking people to trust their money with you. That is a high stakes decision that generally is dependent on long-standing social capital, long-standing trust.” Because it’s a risk-laden space, “regulation massively compounds” those barriers, he said, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “It makes it much harder for finance,” Fischer said. “Whether that be SEC regulation, which has often been a restriction on, say, spaces like crypto where there has been real innovation or at least alternatives that tend to have different cultures developing.” The other barrier Fischer points out is much more pernicious. “Increasingly, the vast majority of capital is allocated by bureaucratic allocators like pension funds hiring investment consultants,” Fischer said. “They tend to use sets of rules that make it very difficult for new entrants to play in that space, especially not new entrants who essentially are cultivated and credentialed not inside the club.” The nature of this bureaucratization makes challenging these industry titans all the more difficult, he said. “If you’re actually challenging the dominant values of that club,” Fischer said, “you’re going to have a hard time getting the initial traction, getting the early adopters, getting the early allocators, who help you get past that hurdle that allows you to compete in the space of pension funds.” It’s this “downside-focused, sort of follow-the-herd mindset of bureaucratic operators versus entrepreneurial ones” that can prove a tough nut to crack, he said. “And so the dominance of bureaucrats in capital allocation means that anyone who departs from the bureaucratic hierarchies and the bureaucratic norms is going to be at a severe disadvantage,” Fischer said. Fishback and his colleagues have become well acquainted with those barriers in starting Azoria. “Obviously, there’s a lot of investment that goes into building out the infrastructure, finding the right partners, the right counterparties, making sure we have the right exchange,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “So you’re right. It’s not as simple as throwing up a podcast on X as an alternative to, say, The New York Times. It’s definitely a heavier lift.” “But the reason why we’re willing to bear this cost at Azoria is because there’s literally no one else doing this,” he said. “There is no other ETF, no other publicly traded investment fund that excludes companies that are anti-meritocratic and, as a result, are underperforming.” “There’s a lot of alternative financial managers out there,” Fishback continued. “I have a lot of respect for them, and some of them are pitching themselves as a patriotic fund or a MAGA fund. But for Americans, there needs to be a publicly traded alternative to the BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, plain old traditional S&P fund.” The moral hazard, however, is that as Fishback and Azoria are more successful, the exchange-traded fund will become less differentiated from other investment product competitors. But, Fishback told The Daily Signal, “there’s still going to be a role to play.” “Just as this ideology came and infected these companies practically overnight, it could happen again. And so the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,” he said. “If these companies like Starbucks abandon these policies tomorrow, it doesn’t mean that they can’t reinstate them two, three, four years down the line and harm shareholders and employees again.” As the coalition that Trump built over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign aims to shake up Washington, its members with a more entrepreneurial and industry-focused mindset are looking to seize this unique political moment in the marketplace. Although the broadness of this Trump coalition offers great opportunities, there’s plenty of work to do in the public and private spheres to channel its efforts into effecting real change. “The coalition right now is basically just everybody who objects to the kind of left-progressive orthodoxy, establishment, whatever you want to call it,” Krein said. “It’s this array of forces against this sort of dominant liberal-progressive consensus that has been dominant for 30-plus years.” Before Jan. 20, when Trump will be sworn in for a second term, it’s no surprise that Mar-a-Lago is serving as this coalition’s meeting place. The challenge for members of the Trump coalition in the private sector, New Founding’s Fischer said, is to build not only alternative institutions but truly innovative ones. “I think we need not just alternatives, but alternatives that really reflect a different way of allocating capital, one that’s more driven by skin in the game, by human judgment,” Fischer said of these alternatives. “The disparate coalition probably can hold together,” American Affairs’ Krein said. “But I don’t know that it can succeed in the sense of actually implementing a successful agenda, building a new consensus, and making itself a new establishment.” “The new consensus is the true goal of success in politics, in my view,” he said. “So I think it can hold together just as a purely oppositional force, but I don’t know if it can win in creating a new positive agenda for itself.” What’s taking place at Mar-a-Lago during this period of transition “proves that President Trump is the great unifier, and there’s nothing more unifying than aspiring for success,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “There were folks in that room who aren’t traditional Trump supporters, who may have just come around to supporting him in this recent election,” Fishback said of the Azoria event Dec. 5. “They recognize what he brings to the table is a transformative, first principles view of government.” “This is a merging of the public sector led by Donald Trump, the private sector led by firms like Azoria, to bring the whole country together,” Fishback added. “There’s only so much that government can do. President Trump is going to be a transformative president, but the private sector, we’ve got to be involved,” he said. “We’ve got to listen to the mandate that voters gave him on Nov. 5. And that’s why we did this on Dec. 5. We wanted to reveal our plan to deliver that from the private sector and to the private sector.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

With Lansdowne hosting St Mary’s in one of their Friday night fixtures, the pick of the remaining four games sees fourth placed Terenure host second placed Ballynahinch at Lakelands in the first of the back-to-back rounds which also marks the half way point in the campaign. Terenure welcome back the Leinster academy duo of Austrian outhalf Casper Gabriel and winger Henry McErlean. Loosehead Adam Tuite and hooker Levi Vaughan are also promoted from the bench, while influential number eight Jordan Coghlan returns from injury. Ballynahinch’s run of five wins with bonus points which propelled them to the top of the table came to a shuddering halt when well beaten at home by Clontarf last week. Ulster’s Conor McKee and Academy back rower Bryn Ward come into the starting XV. Backrower Reuben Crothers and lock Declan Horrox also return. Somewhat inconsistent until now Terenure will be targeting a third successive win but then again pretty much every team in 1A has been relatively up-and-down in the most unpredictable campaign for some time. Nonetheless that 32-12 bonus point win by Clontarf in Ballynahinch did look like one of the loudest statements of the season to date. Aitzol King moves to fullback as James Conroy and Mark O’Sullivan form a new back three when Clontarf host City of Armagh, while John Vinson returns to number eight with Alex Soroka shifting to blindside and Ben Griffin coming in at loosehead. Armagh head coach Chris Parker has recalled centre Matthew Hooks, with New Zealander Rocky Olsen reverting to outhalf, while number ‘8′ Neil Faloon and Ulster Academy prop Cameron Doak return up front. The champions Cork Con shift Ireland 7s player Sean French to fullback in the absence of Billy Crowley for the visit of UCD. Killian Coghlan comes in at centre and James Taylor, last May’s match-winner in the final, is recalled at outhalf behind an unchanged pack. Ireland under-20 internationals Mikey Yarr and Andrew Sparrow will start in the UCD front row on Leeside, with Bobby Sheehan reverting to the back row. Outhalf Daragh Gilbourne and lock Matt Healy return, while captain James Tarrant switches to inside centre. Con won two high-scoring meetings last season by 38-25 at home and 34-24 in the Bowl last January, while the students’ preparations will not have been helped by their end-of-term exams this week even if some of those were conducted in Cork. Young Munster and Garryowen meet in the top flight’s first Limerick derby of the season seeking to end losing runs of three and seven games respectively. Julian Leszczynski reverts to his more familiar role of outhalf for the Cookies as Stephen Lyons returns at fullback. Samson Seinafo starts in midfield, while prop David Begley starts at loosehead and a reshuffled back row features Munster’s Ruadhan Quinn. The Light Blues are without Brian Gleeson due to him being called up for his Munster debut in Castres after scoring three tries in his last two outings.

Title: Is Lululemon Athletica (LULU) the Best Fitness and Gym Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. Tyler Olson/Shutterstock.com To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database.

Lululemon Athletica’s (NASDAQ:LULU) consumer retention is high, giving it the opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with increased newness in its assortment. The company is continuing to grow its membership program, currently standing at around 24 million members. The offers it makes to its members, including partner perks, members-only events, and early access, are the primary drivers of this growth. The company’s unaided brand awareness stands at 36% in the US, allowing it to grow as it continues to open and optimize stores and launch new brand campaigns and activations. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) ranks second on our list of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “I mentioned last quarter and higher above that I like buying quality stocks on sale. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), the 2nd worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, qualifies. I published a full thesis on the stock before its most recent earnings, but the basics: the yoga pants and clothing company has had an amazing post-pandemic run that is approaching its end. Its growth in the US is slow/non-existent at the moment, but it is growing very fast in China and Europe. I think that international growth is likely to endure, and that its US slowness is likely to be temporary. Lululemon shares are not ‘cheap’, but they are on sale for an average price, and I think the company will grow faster than average over the next five years. I would be wrong if Lululemon is a fad gone bust, or faces a huge post-pandemic hangover as people get used to leaving the house more. We’ll see.” Overall, LULU ranks 2nd on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LULU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LULU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) develops, markets, and distributes branded athletic performance apparel, accessories, and footwear for men, women, and youth. It operates in four geographic segments: North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company’s product offerings continue gaining momentum, including new products in its men’s apparel and footwear businesses. Its initial strategies for fiscal Q2 2025 were focused on its direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce channels. In such efforts, the company significantly reduced its promotional activities, especially in its e-commerce business in North America. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) is also reducing its stock-keeping units (SKUs) to create a more premium product assortment that offers a cleaner and faster consumer experience. Due to these initiatives, the company’s fiscal Q2 2025 revenue decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion. Its North American DTC business was also down for the quarter, primarily due to a continued decline in its e-commerce business, which resulted from proactive strategies to reduce promotional activities. Overall, UA ranks 9th on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of UA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: US House panel finds BlackRock, other asset managers leery of joining climate initiative
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-panel-finds-blackrock-other-asset-managers-leery-of-joining-climate-initiative-3772126
Time Published: 2024-12-13T19:20:42Z
Full Content:
By Isla Binnie, Ross Kerber NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. asset managers were worried that signing up to an industry climate initiative could make them appear to be working too closely together and draw regulatory scrutiny, according to a report released on Friday by a Republican-led U.S. congressional committee. The report is the latest released by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's Republican majority as part of a probe they say has shown fund firms and activists are part of a "climate cartel" that colludes through shareholder organizations pressing to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed those allegations. Top fund firms have denied wrongdoing, but material cited in the report shows they had always been concerned about appearing too cozy with shareholder groups engaged in climate activism. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s view in 2019 was that "We don't do collective action/engagements. Too risky," according to the report, citing an emailed summary of a meeting that unidentified BlackRock executives held with Ceres, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group, obtained by the committee. Likewise State Street (NYSE:STT) also raised concerns around 2020 about "collusion" if it joined a Ceres-backed effort to press companies to cut emissions known as the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+, or CA100+, according to the report. The firm worried about raising the "perception of engaging or voting as a block," the report states. BlackRock declined to comment. State Street did not comment. Both wound up joining the CA100+, then stepped back earlier this year, citing independence concerns, as the group sought for members to take stronger actions. Republican officials, many of them from oil and gas producing states, have objected to investors coordinating to pressure corporate management on climate issues at the expense of corporate growth and returns. Last month Republican attorneys general from 11 states sued BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, saying their climate activism reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. The firms collectively manage $26 trillion. BlackRock and State Street have denied wrongdoing, while Vanguard has declined to comment on the matter. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned against President Joe Biden's moves to fight climate change and promised to boost U.S. oil and gas production. In theory Trump's administration could follow up on the congressional committee's findings. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on what talks, if any, it may have had with current or future administrations. A section of the committee's report describes how the top fund firms helped elect dissident directors at energy leader Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in 2021, under pressure by activists including Ceres. In a statement Ceres said: "The claims in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee report are completely false. Climate Action 100+ does not control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so." Moreover, the dissident directors have been overwhelmingly reelected in each year since, Ceres said, a result "completely inconsistent with the claim that they were somehow a hostile force in the company."

Though the products have helped turn Bitcoin into a Wall Street darling, the industry’s second largest coin by market cap hasn’t had the same run, though spot Ethereum ETFs saw a burst of post-election momentum, Still, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) recently notched record-setting inflows, pulling in $293 million as Ethereum’s price dipped to $3,800 on December 5. The following day, Ethereum’s price marched past $4,000, eclipsing the psychological mark for the first time since March. The uptick in flows for the iShares Ethereum ETF coincided with commentary from Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs. On Thursday, he said BlackRock is at the “tip of the iceberg” with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, focusing on those offerings instead of expanding its roster, per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF is dominant in the U.S., similar products are seeing renewed attention worldwide, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt. Since November 20, investors have poured $3.5 billion into Ethereum investment products, he said. “It’s not just a BlackRock or iShares thing,” Butterfill said. “We’re seeing quite a unanimous turnaround in sentiment for Ethereum, which has really been suffering.” Notably, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw its best day of net inflows Thursday as investors stuffed $200 million into the product, according to Coinglass. Indeed, the conversation surrounding Ethereum has been mired in debate over whether layer-2 networks, which are faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum’s base layer, are sucking value away from their underlying network. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price hasn’t cracked its all-time high price of $4,800 in 2021, as competitors like Solana have set surged to record prices. “Ethereum is the underdog this year,” said Butterfill. “It’s playing a bit of catch-up.” Pointing to three consecutive weeks of outflows from Solana investment products, Butterfill said investors’ enthusiasm might have cooled. Still, asset managers like Bitwise and 21Shares have filed applications for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. this year, a move that could eventually broaden investors’ access to the coin in a similar fashion to Bitcoin and Ethereum. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier attributed $273 million worth of inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs to the president-elect's comments Thursday. Ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Donald Trump said “We’re gonna do something great with crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.
