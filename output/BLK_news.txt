REUTERS/Ann Wang/ File Photo Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum said on Wednesday it has raised $1 billion in its latest funding round at a valuation of $7 billion, and announced a collaboration with Nvidia to speed up development of its quantum computers. The Series E funding round was led by investment firms BlackRock, Temasek and Baillie Gifford and saw participation from new investors including Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, Macquarie Capital and Ribbit Capital. PsiQuantum said the funding will help the company go ahead with sites in Brisbane, Australia and Chicago, Illinois as well as roll out large test systems to prove its design. Quantum technology has the potential to perform calculations that would stump even the most powerful AI systems and could unlock a host of scientific and commercial applications, including cybersecurity. The technology may help in drug discovery and in materials research.

Title: Polymarket’s Top Trader Bets on a 50bps Fed Rate Cut Next Week
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/10/polymarket-s-top-trader-bets-on-a-50bps-fed-rate-cut-next-week

A leading trader on decentralized betting platform Polymarket, who goes by the name JustWakingUp, is wagering that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) next week. According to X handle Polymarket Whales, JustWakingUp is the platform’s most prolific trader, boasting nearly $400 million in total trading volume to date and profits exceeding $2 million. The trader has placed a $15,000 bet that the Fed will reduce rates by 50 bps to 3.75% next week and is already showing a 3% gain on the position as of writing. The trader stands to make roughly $226,000 if the Fed does cut rates by 5 bps. The market, however, largely expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week, with the CME’s FedWatch Tool assigning a 91% probability to such an outcome. That said, the odds of a jumbo 50 bps cut have surged to nearly 10% following Friday’s disappointing August jobs report, reflecting growing expectations of more aggressive easing. BlackRock and StanChart have called for a 50 bps cut. Adding to market expectations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously estimated, marking the largest annual downward revision on record. Traders are now closely watching Wednesday’s U.S. Producer Price Index and Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data releases. Softer-than-expected readings could add to expectations for a 50 bps cut, potentially sending bitcoin and stocks higher.

Title: CoinShares Sets Sights on Wall Street: Will the $1.2B Nasdaq Debut Redefine Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinshares-sets-sights-on-wall-street-1-2b-nasdaq/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T03:00:56Z
Full Content:
CoinShares, Europe’s largest digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, has announced plans to go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited. The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

Differently from TradFi, part of BlackRock’s activities can be seen on-chain, with BTC and ETH moves to (deposits) and from (withdrawals) Coinbase Prime accounts, usually representing sales and purchases, respectively. On that note, Lookonchain and other on-chain analytic tools have been monitoring BlackRock activity, spotting recent likely sell-offs in the past two days, with significant deposits to Coinbase. On September 9, BlackRock-owned accounts deposited 44,774 ETH, worth $195.29 million, and 900 BTC, worth $101.67 million, to Coinbase Prime, based on Lookonchain’s post. Before that, on September 8, the asset manager was seen depositing 72,370 ETH, worth $312 million, and 266.79 BTC, worth $29.88 million.

Nevertheless, the deposits and withdrawals are not necessarily representing all the sales and purchases in real time—simply reserve adjustments. For example, on September 8, IBIT and ETHA saw net flows of +229 BTC, worth $25.50 million, and -43,770 ETH, worth $192.70 million, respectively, according to data from Coinglass. On September 9, however, IBIT added 227 BTC. Lookonchain reported this movement in the September 9 update, showing similar numbers that conflict with the recently observed on-chain activity. Total Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF net inflows | Source: Coinglass Both assets had massive outflows last Friday, on September 5, which may have required the reserve adjustments on Coinbase Prime, as seen earlier today from the Lookonchain report, causing large deposits and sell-offs. Or, institutions are positioning in advance of a yet unknown pricing event, as smart money like BlackRock can be seen as a market canary. Now, the price charts appear to be forming a bullish structure for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, potentially signaling a recovering institutional interest, again conflicting with the signal from Wall Street whales. Additionally, Arkham has reported BlackRock is “buying more” cryptocurrencies, reaching over $100 billion in total reserves.

Uptrend structure is intact but sentiment is bearish in this pullback and many are calling it a sell the news event. How am I playing this? 🧵↓(1/7) pic.twitter.com/h1Y4DhFXK7 — CrypNuevo 🔨 (@CrypNuevo) September 7, 2025 Other indicators, like Tether minting 2 billion USDT during a market dip, very similar to what happened in December 2024, could also suggest it is time to buy and not sell, as seen in BlackRock’s recent activities. All that only evidences the volatility and complexity of short-term speculation, which is affected by a lot of nuance and different factors, together with big players’ movements.

The decentralized exchange and layer-1 network is currently being powered by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT0, but Hyperliquid’s community is currently soliciting proposals on a “Hyperliquid-alinged” stablecoin that could serve as an alternative. Proposals have already been penned by entities including stablecoin issuer Paxos, but Ethena’s proposal emphasizes that its support would also come with that of its partners. Ethena flexed partnerships with Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital assets bank, and Securitize, the BlackRock-backed, real-world asset tokenization firm. Anchorage issues Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, which is backed by BlackRock’s tokenized BUIDL fund. “We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users,” BlackRock Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick said in the proposal. Introduced in the first quarter of 2023, Hyperliquid was viewed as a scrappy DeFi Startup not too long ago. But now projects like Ethena are clamoring for its feedback, underscoring how that perception is changing. Hyperliquid has $5.7 billion in stablecoins on its network, for example, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. Under Ethena’s proposal, USDH would be initially backed by USDtb, and therefore have indirect backing from the $14 trillion asset manager’s BUIDL fund. With at least 95% of the revenue generated by USDH’s reserves, distributions would be made to Hyperliquid’s so-called Assistance Fund, alongside HYPE purchases and distributions to validators. HYPE changed hands around $53 on Tuesday, a 20% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token serves as Hyperliquid’s governance token, letting holders participate in the process of voting on software upgrades and other initiatives. If Ethena receives a green light, the project would cover transaction costs associated with making USDH the go-to stablecoin within Hyperliquid’s exchange, its proposal adds. Among other notable benefits, the proposal states that Anchorage would issue Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin natively on Hyperliquid’s network. On top of that, Securitize would deploy its platform on the layer-1, bringing “institutional grade tokenized funds, stocks, and other financial products to the Hyperliquid ecosystem for no deployment cost.” CORRECTION (September 10, 2025, 12:17 p.m. PT): Removes mention of World Liberty Financial, which is not among the suitors for Hyperliquid's stablecoin.

Title: BlackRock Just Sold $192 Million Worth of Ethereum — Has ETH Peaked?

Ethereum ETFs recently witnessed major selling activity as the crypto market remained under pressure overall. The second-largest digital currency by market capitalization experienced a bullish August overall, as the price index witnessed significant appreciation fueled by a buying frenzy from institutional investors. However, the bullish ETF action has cooled considerably in September, and this is reflected in the price index. Ethereum is currently changing hands at around $4.3k at press time. The cryptocurrency has been trading flat around this level for the better part of the last week despite sizable ETF outflows. Here are details of ETF flows for the last 10 days or so: According to the figures from CoinGlass, Ethereum ETFs have witnessed around $1 billion in consecutive outflows since 29 August. In the last two days alone, more than $540 million has been pulled out of these financial instruments, which is generally not a good sign for any underlying asset. BlackRock alone sold $192 million yesterday, while Grayscale witnessed a minor addition of $11 million. Some Ethereum and crypto critics were quick to jump on this prolonged selling spree over at the ETFs as a sign that a bear market is imminent. However, ETFs are only a small portion of the market. Most of the Ethereum is still being bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or held in private wallets. Over there, the situation is opposite. According to one crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), known as The Martini Guy, the premier programmable digital currency is experiencing a record decline on exchanges. He tweeted: “ETHEREUM ON EXCHANGES HAVE DROPPED TO A NEW LOW WHALES ARE BUYING SO MUCH $ETH RIGHT NOW!” His analysis indicates that exchange activity is showing massive Ethereum buying by whales who are snapping it up at relatively cheap prices and taking it offline in their wallets. Conventional wisdom suggests that once these ETH are removed from the exchanges, it helps create a supply shock that benefits the bulls. The stark contrast between ETF activity and exchange activity reveals that two major market forces are at work on these respective platforms, with the former exhibiting a bearish inclination and the latter witnessing bullish action. It remains to be seen which of these two will be able to dominate the market in the coming weeks and months, which are absolutely crucial as we approach the anticipated end of the 2025 bull market.

Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethena Labs submitted a proposal on Sept. 9 to become the issuer of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin USDH, joining an increasingly competitive race. The bid consists of backing USDH entirely by USDtb, a stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with the support of Anchorage Digital. Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases and ecosystem development. Hyperliquid launched the competitive selection process for USDH following a Sept. 5 announcement that the protocol would introduce its native stablecoin in the next network upgrade. The move targets the $5.5 billion in USDC deposits currently serving as the primary settlement currency on the decentralized exchange. The selection carries significant financial implications for Hyperliquid, which currently records nearly $1.3 billion in estimated annualized revenue, according to DefiLlama data. Additionally, the network achieved an all-time high monthly trading volume of $405.8 billion in perpetual contracts during August. Ethena’s proposal differentiates itself through institutional partnerships and proposed security infrastructure. The company plans to establish an elected guardian network of Hyperliquid validators to oversee USDH operations, removing single-issuer control over the stablecoin’s security management. Beyond basic stablecoin issuance, Ethena outlined plans to launch hUSDe, a Hyperliquid-native variant of its synthetic dollar product, and committed $75 million in incentives to support HIP-3 market development.

Competing proposals offer distinct approaches to USDH backing and governance. Paxos proposes backing through New York Department of Financial Services-protected accounts with monthly KPMG attestations. Frax Finance plans frUSD backing through treasury partnerships with BlackRock and Superstate. Agora offers short-dated US Treasuries with proof of reserves powered by Chaos Labs. Sky proposes flexible collateral backing through its risk management framework with LayerZero interoperability. The validator-driven selection process requires proposal approval through community governance before proceeding to a gas auction for final deployment rights. Omar Kanji from Dragonfly estimates the transition could generate $220 million in additional annualized revenue for HYPE holders while reducing Circle’s USDC supply by 7%. Ethena emphasized its track record managing over $23 billion in tokenized dollar assets and positioned itself as the largest counterparty capable of supporting Hyperliquid’s expansion into equity perpetual swaps through HIP-3 markets.

Title: Tokenization Scales From Checkout Security to Central Bank Pilots

Highlights Payment tokenization masks card data, slashes fraud and boosts authorization. Asset tokenization enables fractional ownership, instant settlement and 24/7 trading. Central banks and the BIS are modeling tokenized money and unified ledgers. Tokenization has emerged from a niche concept to a strategic imperative across financial services, increasingly underpinning payment security and the trading of real-world assets.

Δ The catch-all moniker might be viewed as shorthand for the secure transmission of information, but use cases differ, and what follows is a primer to shed some light on the finer points of this digital shift. Distinct tracks are developing in parallel: Credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard convert a card’s primary account number (PAN) into a token. That token is used in place of the real card number across digital wallets, card-on-file providers and in-store NFC payments. Visa now issues billions of tokens, roughly half of global eCommerce transactions are tokenized, with 7% growth in the last quarter alone, bringing total tokens to 15 billion. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney said on a second-quarter 2025 earnings call with analysts in April that tokenization also plays a role in artificial intelligence-facilitated commerce. “Visa Intelligent Commerce … enables consumers to shop and buy with AI agents,” he said. “It combines a suite of integrated APIs, including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication, together with a commercial partner program for AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa’s AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale.” Mastercard reported in June that nearly half of its online transactions in Europe are tokenized, and the company is moving toward fully phasing out manual card entries by 2030. Building on this, Mastercard in April unveiled Agent Pay, a product suite embedding programmable token services into agent-led commerce and subscription flows. The initiative positions tokenization as an enabler of new business models, from delegated payments to merchant-agnostic loyalty linking. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization involves turning tangible assets, like real estate, stocks, bonds or commodities, into tradable blockchain tokens. Kraken, BlackRock and R3 are among firms advancing RWA tokenization. Kraken now offers tokenized U.S. equities for eligible non-U.S. clients via offshore subsidiaries, allowing 24/7 trading and settlement. R3 and Solana are collaborating to bring regulated assets on-chain, with R3 reporting over $10 billion in regulated assets already live across its private networks. Tokenization offers benefits: Yet challenges remain: Tokenization is also redefining global money movement. On-chain rails bypass the frictions of correspondent banking and support programmable features like real-time compliance checks. Examples are multiplying. Vera Capital announced in April a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize commercial real estate, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared in a shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” R3 and Solana’s tie-up illustrates this shift. “The future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure,” Solana Foundation President Lily Liu said, while R3 CEO David E. Rutter called it “a strategic realignment for the entire industry.” Kraken’s launch of xStocks, or tokenized U.S. equities tradable 24/7, demonstrates the leap from pilot to production. Backed one-to-one by custodied shares, these tokens allow fractional ownership and instant settlement. Kraken has since announced multichain expansions, aiming to give investors a choice of blockchain ecosystems while maintaining regulatory compliance. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks. The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission. The Federal Reserve is likewise active, hosting workshops and joint research with the BIS on tokenization and payments modernization. Fed staff have stressed the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to ensure tokenization scales responsibly. Through Project Pine, which offers a prototypical tokenization “toolkit” to pay interest on reserves, there’s the exploration where “central bank reserves are digital tokens that exist in the token arrangement with other types of money and securities … Above the settlement layer is the ‘asset layer,’ consisting of the wholesale money and securities issued … These tokens represented the reserves, commercial bank deposits, securities and unsecuritized assets that would be used in testing scenarios.” Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments.

Title: Ethena Joins Race for Hyperliquid's Stablecoin With BlackRock-Backed Proposal

Time Published: 2025-09-09T16:42:00Z
Full Content:
Decentralized finance protocol Ethena ENA$0.7766 submitted Tuesday a proposal to issue Hyperliquid's upcoming stablecoin, joining a bidding race that has already attracted a slew of companies like Paxos, Sky, Frax and Agora. The token would be fully backed by Ethena's USDtb, a stablecoin issued with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and fully backed by BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund by asset management giant BlackRock and Securitize. "We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users," said Robert Mitchnick, Blackrock's head of digital assets, in the proposal. If adopted, Ethena pledged that 95% of net revenue from USDH reserves would flow back to the Hyperliquid ecosystem, the proposal said. Ethena also said it would cover the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs on Hyperliquid to USDH to ease adoption. The proposal comes as competition to win the issuance of Hyperliquid's USDH stablecoin is intensifies. The decentralized exchange executed almost $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume last month, making it an attractive market for stablecoin providers to corner. Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Paxos, Sky, Frax, Agora and Native Markets threw their hat in the ring. Validators are set to vote on proposals on September 14.

Title: Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Pay Package Is Just Bad Corporate Governance

Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the gargantuan package proposed by Tesla—based on a series of implausible performance targets—suggests a board in thrall to its charismatic, erratic CEO. Elon Musk at the grand opening of the Tesla Giga Texas plant in 2022. This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party—considered a Nazi apologist group—and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Real-World Assets Nearly Died. Now They’re Soaring In Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/09/real-world-assets-nearly-died-now-theyre-soaring-in-crypto/

BySandy Peng, Contributor. For years, tokenization was where good ideas went to die. Hundreds of projects promised to change the financial world forever, by putting real estate, stocks, and commodities on different blockchains. But by 2021, over 90% had failed to achieve meaningful trading volume, with many industry insiders writing post-mortems, and investors moving on. The experiment, it seemed, was over. Then, something strange started to happen. While everyone turned their heads to Capitol Hill in the hopes of regulations clearing, tokenized RWAs grew from $5 billion to $24 billion in just two years. It seemed that the years of failed experiments didn’t stop the idea – but refined it instead. Some argue this is only the beginning. While most RWAs today see limited transaction volume, their long-term implications could be transformative. As assets from real estate to commodities and intellectual property move onchain, we may edge closer to a system where value is swapped directly for value, a modern form of digital bartering. In such a world, dollar-denominated settlements in global trade could diminish, especially as AI-driven financial coordination accelerates. Last month, in July 2025, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group acquired a ¥100 billion office tower in Osaka. The bank’s plan was unusual: convert the entire 30-story building into onchain tokens. Soon, retail investors will be able to buy fractional ownership, with institutional allocations handled via Japan’s digital securities rails (Progmat/STs). Every transaction will settle in seconds, and every ownership transfer will carry full legal weight under Japan’s security-token framework. What happened in Osaka represents one of largest single-asset tokenizations in history. At the same time, this news headline led to many people looking into RWAs again – and discovering their quiet, but explosive growth. RWA tokenization expanded from $5B (2022) to ~$24B (June 2025), a ~380% surge, outpaced only by stablecoins. And the growth doesn’t stop there - Boston Consulting Group projects $16T market by 2030; while Standard Chartered projects $30.1T by 2034. Even a fraction of these numbers would reshape how value moves through the global economy. The St. Regis Aspen resort was one of the first examples of tokenizing real estate. In 2018, the luxury hotel sold $18M of tokens to accredited investors. The tokens then closed at $1.32 on their first trading day (up 32% from the $1.00 offering price). Yet, the liquidity dwindled quickly – by 2020 the tokenized-real-estate market saw anemic volumes. The concept made sense, the execution didn’t. Aspen buyers owned shares in an intermediate entity, not the property directly, with stacked SPV structures, extra fees, and unclear rights. Next was Harbor’s $20M student-housing tokenization, which secured approvals but struggled to find sustained investor demand. The Hub consisted of a premier off-campus and student housing at the University of South Carolina. Equity in the property was divided into 955 shares (as tokens) priced at $21,000 each. However, the project failed after the lender blocked it, due to legal conflicts with mortgage terms. By 2021, observers noted that <10% of tokenized real-estate projects showed meaningful secondary trading. Three failures defined the first wave: (1) legal non-recognition of tokenized title, (2) tiny accredited-only investor pools with $10k+ minimums, and (3) no market-maker/liquidity infrastructure. By 2022, it was clear – in order for tokenization to survive and for the market to attract more novel use cases, these foundations would have to be fixed. Dubai addressed core problems first, proposing a direct property tokenization model with improved legal recognition. The Dubai Land Department launched Prypco Mint in May 2025 – minimums started at AED 2,000 (~$540), with token transfers synced directly to government land records. The agency itself projects tokenized real estate could reach AED 60B (~$16B), about 7% of all transactions, by 2033. Early offerings sold out rapidly. Behind the scenes, Japan followed with clear security-token rules: since 2021, the country has recorded dozens of tokenized real-estate and bond issues under its ST regime, paving the way for MUFG’s ¥100B tower. Technical rails needed to adapt in parallel in order to allow the masses to participate in more tokenization events. Chainlink launched real-time Data Streams for U.S. equities/ETFs across 37 blockchains, which was critical for pricing tokenized stocks/bonds onchain. Then, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon launched tokenized money-market fund shares on a private chain, covering funds from managers like BlackRock and Fidelity – a key bridge for a $7T asset class. Most importantly, tokenized assets found buyers in DeFi. MakerDAO has at times held >$1B in real-world assets backing DAI, with RWAs contributing the majority of revenue. Ondo Finance attracted ~$650M AUM and ~15,000 holders in USDY (as of mid-2025), making tokenized T-bill yield accessible outside the US. Composability solved the early liquidity problem: tokens could serve as collateral, move across venues, and generate yield. Larry Fink was right when he declared tokenization "the next generation for markets" in 2022. But the shift over the past few years looks different than how most expected. Rather than disrupting traditional finance through confrontation, tokenization is being absorbed and deployed by incumbents themselves. When MUFG tokenizes a $681 million building, when Goldman creates blockchain-based money market funds, when BlackRock engineers MakerDAO’s Treasury investments, they've acknowledged something that has been hiding in plain sight. The current system, with its settlement delays, access restrictions, and operational friction, has become competitively disadvantaged. The objections that stopped earlier attempts are now dissolving. The SEC’s Project Crypto explicitly aims to facilitate tokenized securities trading on decentralized platforms. Major custodians like BNY Mellon are managing tokenized funds, giving institutional blessing to the concept. The infrastructure now handles everything from compliance to price discovery to secondary trading. Yet perhaps the most significant shift is competitive pressure. Every asset that remains exclusively offchain becomes less liquid, less accessible, and more expensive to trade relative to tokenized alternatives. Financial institutions that resist tokenization risk watching their assets and services become obsolete. Stocks, bonds, and real estate were just the beginning. Even more interesting use cases will be happening at the edges – as more variety of assets is brought into the onchain world. One example worth highlighting is Project Mocha, who are building on Scroll – a blockchain that I co-founded, which tokenizes individual coffee trees in Kenya. Their model allows coffee lovers to directly invest in coffee trees, funding farmers who need upfront capital to allocate for faster farm growth, whilst also getting a share of the revenue. Similar approaches are emerging for solar farms sharing energy revenue, cargo containers generating shipping fees, and even music royalties flowing directly to fans. Today’s $24 billion in tokenized assets represents less than 0.01% of global wealth. The surface has barely been scratched. But the trajectory points clearly toward a future where every asset (whether it is stocks or real estate) exists natively onchain. The question facing every financial institution, every asset manager, every investor, is simple: How quickly can you adapt to a world where everything is tokenized? Because ready or not, that world is arriving.

Fidelity Investments has rolled out its tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum ETH$4,429.21 blockchain, marking the Boston-based investment management giant's entrance in the rapidly growing tokenized asset field. Some $202 million in Fidelity Digital Interest Tokens (FDIT) were minted blockchain in early September, blockchain data on Etherscan shows. FDIT is the token representation of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYOXX), the on-chain share class of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which seeks to provide yield to investors by holding U.S. Treasury bills. The asset manager first unveiled the facility in March in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The key investor in the offering is tokenization platform Ondo Finance, holding $202 million in FBIT as a reserve asset for its OUSG yield-generating token, Ondo's daily report shows. OUSG uses a range of tokenized money market funds including BUIDL by BlackRock and Securitize, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and WisdomTree's WTGXX to back the token's value. Tokenization of government debt, a crucial collateral asset in global markets, is part of a broader push to bring financial instruments, or real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers like Fidelity Investments explore tokenization to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock. The market of tokenized U.S. Treasuries is growing rapidly, more than tripling in the last year to $7.5 billion, RWA.xyz data shows. BlackRock and tokenization specialist Securitize dominates the market with the $2.4 billion BUIDL token, followed by offerings by Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. These tokens are increasingly used as a key piece of infrastructure for yield-earning strategies and collateral in the crypto economy.

VideoVerse’s clients include the Indian Premier League and Women’s Premier League (cricket) tournaments, FIFA+, and broadcasters Nippon TV and Clubber TV. Mumbai-based VideoVerse was founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil. The company is backed by Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners (a fund by former Sequoia India execs), Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures, and have raised $105 million in funding to date. While Minute Media or VideoVerse didn’t provide a valuation for the deal, sources told TechCrunch that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last round in 2023, and Minute Media’s deal was in a similar range. Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled said that VideoVerse’s acquisition is the biggest for the company in terms of both value and company size. Minute Media has largely grown through strategic mergers and acquisitions, including The Players’ Tribune, FanSided, Mental Floss, and STN Video. Shrivastav said that in its initial days, VideoVerse built multiple AI tools, including one to detect smoking and drinking, which was helpful for the Indian sensor board to flag certain scenes for movie certification. It also worked on object identification and deployed that tech for e-commerce sites for identifying items in a video. However, the startup transitioned to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters. “In 2016, Hotstar (which is now owned by Jio) was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket,” Shrivastav said about starting its sports journey. A few years later, VideoVerse dropped its other products and concentrated on video-editing features for sports content. The company said that it operates like a SaaS tool for which it charges based on the number of hours of footage a broadcaster or streaming service wants to process. The company said it has grown to $65 million in revenue and a healthy EBIDTA margin of 35% to 40%. The company’s chief strategy officer, Prateek Sharma, said that VideoVerse has launched new AI-powered tools in the last few months that let its clients define rules to automatically generate content. For instance, for a basketball game, a broadcaster can create a package for all three-pointers scored by a particular player and automatically publish it on social media. The platform has also added AI-powered translation features to let sports properties reach fans across the globe. Sharma noted that while the platform uses third-party models in its AI workflows, the company uses its own core model to identify key moments in a game. Minute Media’s main reason behind the acquisition is to use VideoVerse’s tech and its own publisher network to better distribute content across various sports properties and generate ad revenue out of distributed content. The sports media company, which has raised $260 million according to Crunchbase data, said that the company reaches over 200 million monthly users through its properties. It also offers a B2B platform for content distribution, used by nearly 500 publishers. Minute Media’s Peled said that this presents a good opportunity to create more content through VideoVerse’s platform and monetize it. “With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content,” Peled said. Minute Media wants to target more U.S.-based leagues with this new acquisition to get them to adopt the highlight-generating platform. Multiple reports suggest that fans are looking for a different kind of content outside traditional coverage, especially on their mobile phones. Minute Media is banking on AI to create that content. Peled said that while the company is not in an active funding round, it might look for more funds in the coming quarters for acquisitions.

Daniel Erb became a corporate landlord kind of by accident. It started in 2020, when he received his first bonus as an investment banker. It was more money than he was used to. He wanted to invest in real estate, so he called his cousin, a research analyst at BlackRock, for advice. As they talked over options, his cousin showed him a striking chart of the number of "housing starts" in the U.S. since 1950 (basically the number of new houses and apartments built each year). It showed that the last 10 years had the fewest starts since the 1960s, even though the U.S. population was now much larger. Loading... It was a full decade of underinvestment. They focused on single-family homes — the classic house with a yard, often in the suburbs. "I'm a millennial," says Erb. "I've always envisioned having a home." But none of his friends had bought a house yet. Neither had he. Contemplating this lack of new houses and rising demand from millennials like him, he saw "a big opportunity … something that I was willing to spend my career on." So Erb and his cousin raised money from investors, bought homes in places like the Chatham-Arch neighborhood in Indianapolis (which was affordable, had a growing population and was benefiting from redevelopment), and rented them out — presumably to people who wanted a house with a yard but couldn't afford to buy one. Erb says it was a profitable business. He was not the first New York finance person to profit from single-family rentals across the United States. The private equity firm Blackstone (commonly confused with BlackRock) more or less invented this buy-to-rent strategy in 2012, under the moniker Invitation Homes. It's now a public company valued at more than $18 billion. The response to this development — of Wall Street buying Main Street, or at least some of its cul-de-sacs — has been bipartisan, populist and patriotic condemnation. Both JD Vance and Kamala Harris called for bans on these corporate landlords. Since houses tend to rise in value over time, homeownership has been a primary way that middle-class families build wealth. But now private equity was outbidding aspiring homeowners, making it more expensive to buy a home and pocketing the appreciation in home values. Even some of Erb's friends told him they thought he was making homes unaffordable. "Nothing that has stuck with me or made me second-guess what I'm doing," he says. He wasn't responsible for the decade of underinvestment; he felt they were giving young couples the option to live in a house without breaking their bank account. "But, yeah, very emotional conversations." Now that these institutional investors have been buying and renting out houses for more than a decade, researchers have had time to study their impact. And they've found a surprising nuance. These investors can and do make homeownership harder to attain, just as their critics claim. But by providing rentals, they also make neighborhoods more affordable and more diverse. They are diversifying the suburbs. When institutional investors first started buying single-family homes, the U.S. government laid out the welcome mat. Before the Great Recession, major investors hadn't had much interest in the suburbs. In the early 2000s, a firm called Redbrick Partners tried buy-to-rent. It ultimately abandoned the effort. Unlike in an apartment building, its leadership noted, where corporate management is common, fixing faucets and other maintenance were much less efficient when dealing with geographically dispersed homes. But during the Great Recession — just before the decline of new starts in Erb's chart — the U.S. had a glut of single-family homes in foreclosure. Many were auctioned off en masse, including by the federal government, which organized auctions for investors like Blackstone and even provided a $1 billion loan guarantee to encourage Blackstone to buy. This allowed private equity firms (which raise money from wealthy families, pension funds and other organizations to seek out profits, often by buying private companies) and real estate investors to efficiently and cheaply buy, say, a dozen similar homes located in the same Phoenix suburb. This solved two big problems for these institutional investors. It reduced the "search costs" of finding suitable homes (often starter homes with three bedrooms), and it allowed them to buy similar homes clustered in one area (which ameliorated the dispersed-faucets problem). Blackstone then introduced a financial product that supercharged the buy-to-rent sector: the rent-backed security. It was a bond, or IOU. Investors bought them, providing Blackstone with more money to buy and renovate homes. In exchange, investors were entitled to a cut of future rent payments. Wall Street could now buy homes by paying with the rent they would collect in the future. Per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the number of homes owned by Blackstone and similar firms increased from almost nothing in 2010 to around 400,000 by 2021. This is around when Erb and his cousin started buying homes. The batch auctions were long gone. But Erb says new technology allows companies like his to have a geographically dispersed portfolio of homes. The universality of listing platforms such as Redfin and Zillow keeps search costs down. Products like Ring cameras allow potential tenants to tour properties without being shown around by an agent. And software like Zoom has made it easier for them, like other executives, to manage a remote workforce. In 2012, many government officials had welcomed firms like Blackstone into the housing market because they worried about abandoned houses and saw rental conversions as a win. Today, though, institutional investors compete with middle-class families for starter homes. Is that why homeownership has gotten more expensive? As Kamala Harris and JD Vance were calling for bans on corporate landlords, Konhee Chang was a Ph.D. student in economics. Born in Korea, Chang had always rented while living in the U.S. but never the "quintessential house that I think of when I think about an American house," with a front yard and a backyard. He wanted to know why there were so few rentals in the suburbs and who would live there if renting was an option. Chang realized these investors' buy-to-rent strategy provided an ideal case study of what happens when more rentals are available. If someone had built new homes to rent out, that would increase the supply of homes, changing the neighborhood. But since they converted homes into rentals, only one variable had changed, like in an experiment. So Chang assembled and analyzed data on neighborhoods before and after corporate landlords showed up, including demographic data on the residents. His biggest finding? Institutional investors were reducing segregation. When private equity rented out homes, the new tenants tended to be lower income than the prior owners and more likely to be young and nonwhite. "I think I was most surprised by the fact that the effect was so sharp and immediate," says Chang, who has since earned his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He took it as a sign that these families really wanted to live in these areas but were prevented by the lack of rentals and their inability to get a mortgage. This is particularly notable because one of the most important economics findings of the past decade is the impact on children's development and career prospects of their hometown and neighborhood. (You can listen to a Planet Money episode on moving to opportunity here.) Suburban neighborhoods are not inherently better than rural or urban areas. But another study, for example, showed that single-family rentals in North Carolina served "as a pathway for access to high-performing public schools" for economically disadvantaged children. These results did not turn Chang into a cheerleader for private equity. He's too careful a scholar, and his results hold for rentals in general, regardless of whether the landlord is Invitation Homes or a couple down the street. Plus, he did not investigate other criticisms of corporate ownership. (For example, a Bloomberg investigation in 2013 found that Magnetar Capital LLC became the largest landlord in Huber Heights, Ohio, and then pushed for lower assessments of its properties' value. If it had succeeded, it would have been the largest property tax cut in county history, reducing the school district's budget by $800,000 a year.) Most of all, Chang found that the buy-to-rent strategy was hurting the middle class. Creating rentals aided lower-income families and nudged rents down. But reducing the supply of homes available for sale also pushed home prices up, hurting families on the cusp of homeownership. Erb says he feels good about the rental service they provide. (In 2024, he and his cousin teamed up with a veteran real estate investor to co-found a larger investment firm, Strand Capital.) But he agrees this trade-off exists. "There's always gonna be a cost and a benefit," he says. But the bigger problem for housing affordability, he adds, is that "we just haven't built enough [homes] to keep up with the population growth and household formation." "People get really riled up about this idea of private equity coming in and buying the block," says Daryl Fairweather. "I think they are kind of the boogeyman though." That's because institutional investors own a very small slice of single-family homes in the United States. As the chief economist at the real estate platform Redfin, Fairweather says investors purchase about 17% of homes. But most of those purchases are by mom-and-pop investors, not big firms like Blackstone. Institutional investors just don't own enough homes to be the main culprit for high home prices. In fact, Fairweather sees some societal benefits of institutional investors. Unlike with mom-and-pop landlords, it's easier to regulate large corporate landlords and check whether they are, say, following the Fair Housing Act. Plus, in places like Silicon Valley, where politicians are trying to address housing crises by encouraging the development of duplexes and triplexes, profit-driven institutional investors are a potential boon, since they're more likely to turn suburban homes into duplexes. And in areas with more open land, like the suburbs near Denver, institutional investors are building new housing specifically to rent out. Think cookie-cutter homes, perhaps with a dog park or pool. "I think that we should embrace investors who want to make those kinds of investments," Fairweather says. Still, she thinks middle-class families are right to worry about private equity displacing them from the housing market. She worries about fewer families achieving homeownership and gaining control over this intimate part of their lives, which has also been the dominant path to building wealth in America. But a ban? As an economist, she hates bans. If politicians succeed in banning corporate landlords, perhaps by making it illegal to own more than 300 homes, she suspects we'd see lots of 300-home companies replacing Blackstone — without doing anything to increase homeownership among the middle class. Instead, she advocates for policies that will incentivize and allow developers to build more housing. The trade-off caused by single-family rentals — that they benefit some low-income renters but hurt some aspiring homebuyers — is "because we are restricting the number of homes that can be built in neighborhoods." Many desirable neighborhoods are zoned so that it's impossible to build the duplexes or apartment buildings that would make them accessible to low-income families. Many prosperous towns block the building of new single-family homes, often at the behest of current homeowners who don't want to deal with construction or who want to restrict supply and boost their home's value. The best way to stick it to Blackstone and private equity, to prevent Wall Street firms from profiting off the housing crisis, is to make it easier to build more homes. As for Daniel Erb, even though he has spent his career responding to the dearth of suburban homes, betting on our collective underinvestment in American dream properties, he might appreciate that too. He says he doesn't own a home, in part because he often travels to the towns where his company buys homes. And he says he's not buying for himself at today's prices.

Title: Private Prisons: An Exceptionally Niche Asset Class Meets It Moment

Time Published: 2025-09-09T10:22:57Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy It’s certainly a niche asset class. But one that’s rapidly expanding. The ongoing, record-breaking expansion of the nation’s immigrant detention capacity — due to an expedited mass deportation push that’s been the subject of significant protests, legal rulings and due process complaints — has made private prisons a burgeoning business during the start of the second Trump administration. Industry stalwarts GEO Group and CoreCivic, which have substantial experience in prison operations and a nationwide portfolio of carceral real estate, have seen the coming flood of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding as part of a series of “unprecedented growth opportunities,” said GEO Group Chairman George C. Zoley during the firm’s latest earnings call in August. Roughly $45 billion has been earmarked for detention through September 2029 via the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill. ICE plans to double its detention capacity to nearly 110,000 by the end of this year, which, at full capacity, would make the agency’s wards the 20th largest incarcerated populations in the world. For the private prison industry, this opportunity is one they claim they’re singularly suited to meet. “Our decades-long history of constructing facilities for government use has given us a marketable portfolio of existing, ready-to-activate, high-quality capacity that we view as ideally suited to meet ICE’s immediate needs,” said Ryan Gustin, CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, in a statement sent to Commercial Observer. GEO Group declined to respond to repeated requests for comment. This moment highlights just how these two firms have continuously evolved their operations. The methods by which these companies finance and construct facilities have changed over time, as shifting funding streams and priorities of different administrations — as well as advocacy campaigns and waves of public pushback — have changed the reality on the ground. Generally speaking, the contracts that GEO Group or CoreCivic would get from the federal government have been for operations and management. It’s the recurring revenue fee for running private prison sites. Construction funding comes from a number of sources, which have changed for these firms over time. Bob Libal, a criminal legal reform and immigrant rights advocate in Austin, Texas, had more experience with these companies during their initial wave of expansion in the early 2000s under the George W. Bush administration. During that period, especially in Texas, there was a lot of public financing around private prisons that utilized municipal revenue bonds. During the twilight of the Obama administration, the federal government decided to end federal contracts with private prisons, sending a memo to the Bureau of Prisons instructing the federal agency to decline to renew contracts. During Joe Biden’s administration, the government was instructed to phase out funding to private prisons, but continued to use them for a growing population of detained immigrants. “I think the liability they’ve experienced is that at different times in their corporate history, if the demand for private prisons decreases, then they have empty facilities sitting there, right?” said Shar Habibi, research and policy director of In the Public Interest, a nonprofit that has advocated against private prisons. “That’s not good.” During the first Trump administration, a number of advocacy groups challenged the larger financial institutions — including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and SunTrust (now part of Truist) — that backed these private prison firms in a sustained campaign between 2016 and 2019. Called Families Belong Together, in response to policies that separated detained families, the coalition sought financial pressure points. At the time, the companies were structured as REITs, and needed to distribute most of their taxable income to investors annually, making them dependent on financing, term loans and revolving credit facilities for new construction, said Dov Baum, director of American Friends Service Committee’s Action Center for Corporate Accountability. The allied groups then identified and successfully pressured banks and financial groups to stop funding private prisons. Since then, GEO Group and CoreCivic have dropped their REIT status, which means they aren’t as reliant on external loans, and don’t have to be as transparent about financial records. By and large, the current funding GEO Group and CoreCivic utilizes is administered by Alter Domus, a private lender whose funding sources are much more opaque. Both companies have in-house planning and design capacity as well as in-house construction experience. CoreCivic boasts it can achieve 25 percent cost savings and finish a new facility in 18 months or less. But the recent wave of funding for immigrant detention facilities has been overly focused on speed, which has altered the way vendors have competed for federal dollars, and the facilities they are building or, in most cases, reopening. The Trump administration’s rush to accommodate higher immigrant detention figures has meant a focus on reactivating closed facilities or constructing temporary tent structures on federal land, particularly on Army bases. A number of new contractors, such as disaster-relief providers and other firms like GothamsLLC and Deployed Resources, which sometimes lack direct prison management experience, have been contracted to rapidly erect tents on federal sites. Governors in Indiana, Florida, Louisiana and Nebraska have offered up shuttered state prisons or state-run detention camps, according to data gathered by the nonprofit Detention Watch network. A number of military bases — such as Indiana’s Camp Atterbury, Fort Bliss in Texas, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey — are being used to expand capacity. The haste has led to wasted efforts. The “Alligator Alcatraz” project in the Florida Everglades, funded in part by Federal Management Emergency Agency funds meant for asylum seekers and migrants, was recently ordered closed by a federal judge because the rapidly assembled project skipped over a federal environmental review process, among other issues. (As of press time, the facility remained open following an appeals court ruling staying the judge’s decision.) But the big contractors are still seeing significant revenue opportunities. In many cases, older, underutilized or closed facilities owned by CoreCivic or GEO Group are being reactivated, turning empty and idle facilities into new profit centers. Roughly 20 such facilities existed between both companies at the start of Trump’s second term, due in part to sentencing reforms that shrunk prison populations. Meanwhile, some big names are taking stakes — albeit, for many of them, minor ones — in owner-operators like GEO Group. BlackRock, for instance, has a significant stake in GEO Group. But that’s via its investments in index funds tied to the stock market, not to any particular effort by the firm to single out the private prison company. BlackRock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, State Street Global Advisers and Guggenheim Partners didn’t respond to requests to gain more insight into their own holdings of GEO Group or CoreCivic stock. Geo Group’s Zoley specifically called out the “intrinsic value of our owned real estate assets,” and expects all the firm’s shuttered prisons to be reactivated by the end of the year. CoreCivic purchased the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia for $67 million, which is already accepting detainees, and made substantial progress reactivating three facilities in the spring of this year, with the activation team preparing for additional contracting activity. These reopenings can attract significant protest and pushback from local and state governments, as well as prisoner and immigrant rights groups, over complaints about poor food and lax oversight that in some cases has left prisoners seriously injured. The California City detention center outside of Los Angeles, which CoreCivic reopened in June, raised the ire of local activists and leaders; the state had tried to ban private prisons until the action was judged unconstitutional in 2023. The move to reopen the infamous Leavenworth prison in Kansas via an expedited process known as a letter contract, angered local officials, who filed a lawsuit in opposition. The potential, however, has already shifted the financial performance of these firms. GEO Group’s net income during the first half of 2025 was $48.6 million, a stark turnaround from the first half of 2024, where the firm lost $9.8 million. CoreCivic saw net income jump 103.4 percent in the second quarter versus the same period last year, hitting $38.5 million. These reopened facilities are predicted to make an immediate financial impact. For instance, GEO Group resumed services at the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall in Newark, N.J., starting this year — despite active efforts to sue by the city, which alleged improper permits — and it’s projected to generate $60 million in annualized revenue when it hits full capacity. “There are some people who say that private prisons are better than public prisons because they’re easily closed, because there isn’t pressure from public sector unions,” said Libal, the immigrant rights advocate in Texas. “But my argument is, they’re always trying to reopen, right?” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Nasdaq President Seeks SEC Approval To Tokenize All Assets On Exchange

With companies like BlackRock driving significant growth in the tokenization space, American stock exchange Nasdaq is poised to take advantage of this development by working with US authorities to make it easier for tokenized securities to be traded. In a recent LinkedIn post, Nasdaq President Tal Cohen emphasized the potential of integrating tokenization and blockchain technology with traditional market infrastructure. He pointed out that this fusion could provide substantial advantages to issuers, investors, and the broader economy by reducing friction in transactions, speeding up settlement times, automating processes, and enhancing capital and collateral management efficiencies. As part of this effort, Nasdaq has submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable the trading of tokenized securities on its platform. In his remarks, Cohen acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology to introduce new post-trade processes, modernize proxy voting, and create programmable methods for managing corporate actions. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has offered valuable insights into how core financial services—such as lending, trading, and clearing—can operate differently to deliver value. However, Cohen also highlighted the risks associated with rapid advancements. Cohen stressed the importance of embedding governance and investor protection from the outset to ensure that the benefits of innovation can be fully realized. Nasdaq’s recent filing is seen as a pivotal step in its journey to incorporate digital asset technology into the US equities markets responsibly. The proposal aims to integrate new capabilities into the existing financial system, further enhancing the efficiency and trustworthiness of these markets. If the SEC approves Nasdaq’s proposal, it would represent the first instance of tokenized securities being traded on a major US stock exchange, marking a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain-based settlement into the national market system. Notably, Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, has also sought the regulatory agency’s approval for offering “tokenized equities” to its users, while major banks like Bank of America and Citi have expressed interest in exploring tokenized assets. Once Nasdaq’s proposal is in place and the necessary infrastructure from the central clearing agency is operational, investors could potentially buy shares on Nasdaq that settle in token form, all without altering the current processes for order routing, pricing, surveillance, or reporting. Nasdaq anticipates that US investors may witness the first token-settled trades by the end of the third quarter of 2026, contingent upon the readiness of the Depository Trust Company’s infrastructure.

Title: From Mexico to Ireland: ‘You have to be very resilient - but this is an amazing country’

Ana Garmilla (32) and her Irish partner were able to buy a house together six weeks ago, something she doesn’t believe would have ever been possible in her native Mexico. “We wouldn’t have had the Help to Buy scheme in Mexico, and that was a game changer for us,” she says. Even when accounting for the difference in price for properties in Ireland and Mexico, Garmilla still thinks that she would have never been able to afford to buy a house back home, as the government there don’t offer that kind of help. “I think the Government [in Ireland] is taking a few steps to invite people to buy houses.” Garmilla was born and raised in Puebla, a city in central Mexico. She studied Communications Sciences at university then briefly worked for a local newspaper before becoming a civil servant. By the time she was 24 she was the head of communications and citizens’ affairs in the Department of Infrastructure for the Mexican state of Puebla. However, at 27, Garmilla lost her job as “when you work for the government [in Mexico] and a new administration comes in, you might be out, especially if you have a good job”. At about the same time, Garmilla’s father, who she was very close to, died. Her sister spotted a business English course in Dublin and pushed her to take a career break to study and travel, but Garmilla was very unsure about what to do. Then one day her sister gave her a voucher for a one-way ticket to Dublin. She booked a flight to Dublin for March as she wanted to see the St Patrick’s Day parade. [ ‘In Ireland I started missing the sun very soon, but I knew it was the place I wanted to be in’Opens in new window ] Garmilla landed in Dublin on March 12th, 2020, as Ireland went into lockdown. “Everything was empty. The airports were empty. There was like three people on the plane. It was very surreal.” At first, life in Dublin felt like a big step backwards for Garmilla. “I was living with other Mexicans in an overpriced apartment. Back in Mexico I was living in my own apartment. I had a brand-new car.” Living with fellow Mexicans, Garmilla felt that she wasn’t improving her English, so she found an Irish family in Blackrock, Co Dublin, looking for an au pair, and moved in with them. She ended up living with and working for two families. “That’s where I learned that an Irish person is a very kind and lovely person. I remember for example, if they met somebody rude, they would say, ‘yeah they might be having a bad day’, and I would never have thought of it that way. Where I come from, if somebody was rude to you, you’ll be pissed off and you won’t put yourself in their shoes.” Irish weather took some time to get used to. One day during her first summer in Ireland the father of the family she was working for told her: “It’s a great day out there – we can’t waste it indoors.” Garmilla was confused by this and thought, “He must be one of those overly positive or deeply religious people, grateful for every single day they’re alive,” as she didn’t think the weather at the time was that remarkable. When she experienced her first Irish winter later that year, she began to understand his perspective a lot better. “I learned to make the most out of summer. It’s still tough. Not even the weather, but it being dark at 4pm in the afternoon. I can’t get over that.“ I’m trying to make my own community here with work. It’s not easy During this time, Garmilla met her partner Bryan McQuillan (36). “We met online because it was Covid. We couldn’t even meet each other for a few months because of the restrictions. I was living in Dublin and he was living in Drogheda – at some point he had to come to Dublin for work, and that was how we met.” She described him thus: “Kind, very friendly, very open. I think that Mexican and Irish cultures are very similar. We’re very friendly and family-orientated and I like that.” [ ‘Being pregnant here has made me appreciate the good things Ireland has to offer’Opens in new window ] Garmilla enjoyed her English course and made many friends while doing it. During this time she began to fall in love with life in Ireland. “I realised that Dublin was a capital with the charm and pace of a village – everyone knows each other here and that wouldn’t be the case back home.” When her course finished, she decided to try to find a job here. “I felt like I had to start from scratch. I worked in a pub and in a Volkswagen dealership. They tried to sponsor my visa but it was denied twice.” At 29, Garmilla decided to move back to Mexico. “Ireland is a very expensive country to survive in, and I could only work 20 hours a week on my visa.” But then, the unexpected happened – McQuillan came back to Mexico with her and proposed. “We got married in Mexico and we didn’t have a party or anything because we just decided to start saving money for the house instead. We signed the papers and went for a nice dinner.” The couple came back from Mexico, and Garmilla got a job with the Fórsa trade union. Today the couple live in Drogheda. “We tried to find a place in Dublin and then I saw that for the same three-bedroom house I would have to pay at least €100,000 more, and then I thought if I do have kids I don’t have anybody or any network here. The only network and family we have is his family, so why put myself under that financial pressure?” Garmilla is very close to McQuillan’s family, and admits she “wouldn’t be able to live here if they weren’t. They are the only people I can go to if Bryan isn’t here.” Though she made great friends on her English course, she says most of them have since moved away. “I’m trying to make my own community here with work. It’s not easy, but I suppose I left everything back home, so missing your friend from here is not as tough as missing friends you’ve had for your whole life.” When asked whether she would recommend moving to Dublin to her friends back home she said: “I don’t think it’s for everyone in terms of weather. And I think you have to be very resilient – but it’s an amazing country.” We would like to hear from people who have moved to Ireland in the past 10 years.

Title: The guidance councillor: ‘I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough’

David Drury is a guidance counsellor and head of the guidance and counselling department at Blackrock College. A belief that students must study for a degree is the “predominant mindset” among parents and students, he says. “The CAO dominates the guidance counsellor-student/parent conversation from the end of transition year,” he says. “Then it leads to the alignment and the order of preferencing and they get very caught up in that. They kind of ignore level 7 and level 6. It doesn’t get very much attention.” Drury says “unfortunately”, when it comes to planning what students will do after the Leaving Cert, “the majority would rather follow the high pointer [course] rather than the course that they’re genuinely interested in, or their interests are aligned to. That is the mindset. And it is the mindset of parents. The way they deem it is, the higher the points, the better the course, and the better the opportunities. “It’s not just a south Dublin thing. It’s national. Parents are tuned into the CAO and the points. They’re not tuned into the wonderful level 6 and 7 that can bring you to the very same level 8.” He believes there’s a huge element of degree snobbery at the moment. “I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough.” “Today, apprenticeships can bring you to a level 10,” Drury continues, explaining how some of his past students have taken up apprenticeships in aircraft maintenance, and finance. “Apprenticeships have expanded into new sectors like ICT [information and communications technology], finance, insurance, renewable energies – massive growth there – engineering, logistics, hospitality, farming”, he says. “It’s education with a payslip.” He believes the apprenticeship route is not being “advertised enough in schools, and in the media”. Students and parents should consider the “wonderful routes” that are available to them, he says. Tertiary degrees are another route, he suggests. “Some remain open and will remain open until September,” he says. “It’s a different route with the same degree”, he says explaining how they differ from the CAO. “You start out in an ETB [education and training board]. Classes are small. And from there, meeting the requirements of the course, you will graduate from your ETB in one to two years, and you will join the partner university. There you will go on to finish your degree. You will leave with a level 7 or a level 8, exactly the same as CAO students.” Drury explains that students get “awards for every year you complete”. He makes the distinction between a post-Leaving Cert course (PLC) and a tertiary degree. PLCs offer potential “eligibility to get into a college, but it’s not guaranteed ... a tertiary degree is guaranteed as long as you progress and get the grades”. He says parents “could really help by having that discussion, shortlisting those courses, noting the progression routes and the linked university, noting the deadlines”. Most PLCs, Drury says, are one-year duration. “Very practical, work experience. You can achieve a level 5, a level 6, as long as you reach your grades. And then from there you apply through the QQI [Quality and Qualifications, Ireland] links to the university course that you want to go on to ... Degree offers depend on your PLC results. It will depend on the demand for the course. And it will depend on any extra requirements.” He again cautions to keep an eye out for deadlines. Some students go straight into work, which Drury says is a great idea, but recommends, “because you’re at such a young age, try many different roles. Job hop, or ‘jobdate’, because you’re young. And try them in different countries, if you’re brave. The gap year is not a chill and Netflix ... You need to be motivated. You need to have a goal. You need to polish up your CV – parents could help with that. You need to get on your LinkedIn. “And you’ve got to reach out and network because no one else is going to do that for you.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Your expert guide to navigating the Leaving Cert and choosing the right study options at university and further education © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

David Drury is a guidance counsellor and head of the guidance and counselling department at Blackrock College. A belief that students must study for a degree is the “predominant mindset” among parents and students, he says. “The CAO dominates the guidance counsellor-student/parent conversation from the end of transition year,” he says. “Then it leads to the alignment and the order of preferencing and they get very caught up in that. They kind of ignore level 7 and level 6. It doesn’t get very much attention.” Drury says “unfortunately”, when it comes to planning what students will do after the Leaving Cert, “the majority would rather follow the high pointer [course] rather than the course that they’re genuinely interested in, or their interests are aligned to. That is the mindset. And it is the mindset of parents. The way they deem it is, the higher the points, the better the course, and the better the opportunities. “It’s not just a south Dublin thing. It’s national. Parents are tuned into the CAO and the points. They’re not tuned into the wonderful level 6 and 7 that can bring you to the very same level 8.” He believes there’s a huge element of degree snobbery at the moment. “I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough.” “Today, apprenticeships can bring you to a level 10,” Drury continues, explaining how some of his past students have taken up apprenticeships in aircraft maintenance, and finance. “Apprenticeships have expanded into new sectors like ICT [information and communications technology], finance, insurance, renewable energies – massive growth there – engineering, logistics, hospitality, farming”, he says. “It’s education with a payslip.” He believes the apprenticeship route is not being “advertised enough in schools, and in the media”.

Dear friends, Welcome to the September oh-so-totally back-to-school issue of the Mutual Fund Observer! We’re glad you’re here. I’ve got the privilege of teaching an Honors section of Introduction to the Liberal Arts for the first time in a quarter century. It’s a delight and a terror. Many of my students, like many of you, start with a mistaken idea of what “the liberal arts” are. They are not “the fusty old white guy stuff that they made me sit through until I could get into my major classes.” (sigh) At their simplest, the liberal arts are all the skills you need to learn in order to make a change in the world; the skills needed to put your principles into practice. My students are learning to listen, respect the opinions of others, state them fairly, and respond to them respectfully, and with as much force as the available evidence permits. They’re learning that they have to earn the right to have their conclusions heard. They’ll learn a bit about their ethical responsibilities when it comes to advancing a cause, a bit about research, a bit about artificial intelligence and the lure of cognitive off-loading … and a bit about apples because it’s fall and I love apples. The Augustana College Quad and Activities Fair, 9/6/25 They’ll also read Machiavelli, a singularly excellent translation of The Prince by Tim Parks. And you want to know a secret? They’re going to get into it because about 90% of what you’ve heard about “college kids these days” is crap: they’re incredibly bright and willing to speak up, they have a far greater comfort with differences of thought and appearance than I ever did, they’re deeply skeptical of AI, and are ready to go to war against people who disconnect from the world around them by sinking (or syncing) into phones and earbuds. On this, my 42nd iteration of autumn at Augustana, I’m as hopeful as ever, inspired by their strength and passion. Let’s see how this plays out. I’ll keep you informed. Lynn Bolin examines low-correlation alternatives in “BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) versus BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX),” seeking funds that can provide steady 5% returns with minimal correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. Using quantitative analysis and Portfolio Visualizer, he evaluates how these BlackRock funds performed during challenging periods like the COVID bear market and 2022’s dual stock-bond decline. Bolin ultimately favors BAMBX as part of a diversified low-risk sub-portfolio for volatile times ahead. His companion piece, “Preparing for an Inflection Point on Interest Rates,” responds to recent economic signals, including revised employment data, rising producer prices, and Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks about potential rate cuts. Drawing insights from Kenneth Rogoff’s “Our Dollar, Your Problem,” Lynn anticipates sustained financial volatility, with higher real interest rates and more frequent debt crises. He’s implementing a barbell bond strategy, shifting from short-term to intermediate-duration funds while upgrading to higher-quality bonds and adding inflation protection, preparing for what he sees as a fundamental shift away from the ultra-low rate environment of the past decade. Both essays reflect Lynn’s methodical preparation for increased economic uncertainty, combining rigorous quantitative analysis with strategic positioning for a changing interest rate environment. They’re worth your time. I share a Launch Alert for Franklin Multisector Income Fund, which debuted in the last week of August. The fund resonates with Lynn’s concern about finding investments that are insulated from the probable instability ahead, while at the same time offering the prospect of decent returns while we wait. The literature surrounding it got me thinking about the prudence of looking at income funds that were (a) successful and (b) determinedly isolated from the wobbles of the US market, which led us to … “Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla,” in which we launch a systematic (i.e., MFO Premium-driven) search for income-oriented funds that are insulated from the local lunacy. A screen for funds that could invest flexibly, have made 4% or more over the past five years (had you noticed that core bond funds were underwater for the same period?), are uncorrelated with the US bond market, and qualify as MFO Great Owls (a sign of top 20% risk-adjusted returns across a range of examination periods). Sixteen such funds are available to regular investors, a combination of funds that we’ve written a lot about (RiverPark Strategic Income) and ones that we’d never heard of (Saba Closed-End Fund ETF). We give a snapshot of each and hope to profile a substantial number by year’s end. (If one particularly calls to you, drop me a note and I’ll move it up on the to-do list.) And The Shadow, as ever, tracks down a horde (perhaps a hoard) of industry developments, including a huge number of OEF-to-ETF conversions, two interesting reopenings, and the ongoing flight from funds grappling with climate change. (Pity.) Thing the first: inflation is likely to bite you in the butt sooner than later. Mostly self-inflicted wounds from federal initiatives on tariffs and immigration. Yes, I know, it hasn’t hit yet. That’s due to three short-term factors: people stocked up before Trump’s international goods and services tax took hold, companies have been absorbing the costs of tariffs (which inevitably reduce earnings), and earnings and low energy prices have masked the effects of price increases elsewhere. Goldman Sachs estimates that about 70% of the cost of tariffs will be eventually paid by US households, with the Tax Foundation estimating the cost in the form of higher prices at $1,300 per family. “This is like when you see a flood coming, the tsunami is coming in, and the water’s gone up two inches,” Robertson warned. (Eva Roytburg, “‘It’s like when you see the tsunami coming in’: Agricultural economists are sounding the alarm about produce prices doubling,” Fortune, 8/28/2025) The immigration piece (arresting hundreds of Hyundai workers, most recently) will follow the flow of crop harvests and commodity contracts; deportations have thinned the fields, import taxes have been slapped on a vast amount of produce, and producer contracts signed in January 2025 will be renegotiated at year’s end. Yet these consumers “don’t have a clue what’s going on,” Raymond Robertson, a labor economist at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government who has advised U.S. agencies on trade and labor policy, told Fortune… The first wave of grocery-price increases will likely hit this winter. Robertson predicted produce prices could rise 50% to 100% by early next year as inventories clear and new contracts kick in. And unlike past decades, when Washington would quietly ease border enforcement to keep fields staffed, today’s political environment suggests no such check. (Fortune, 8/28/2025) Thing the second: market speculation reached an all-time high in August. That trading is manifested through two sorts of purchases: zero-day options and freakazoid ETFs. Speculative trading in U.S. equities has surged to historic highs, with retail investors driving activity in ultra-short-term derivatives… [zero-day] options now account for an average of 65% of total S&P 500 options volume in the third quarter of 2025, according to Tier 1 Alpha data shared by The Kobeissi Letter on August 23. For instance, on Thursday, the figure spiked to a record 69%, marking the highest level ever recorded. (Paul L, “Retail stock speculation hits record levels; Incoming market crash?” FinBold, 8/24/2025) Zero-day options allow you to make wild bets about events that need to happen today, and because they’re cheap, a little down can allow you to make a very large bet that has to be covered or cashed out within hours. Separately, the ETF industry has continued to spit out a collection of freakazoid crap. (It’s a technical term describing hardly imaginable opportunities to lose money which never should have seen the light of day; think “double reverse 24-hour Tesla” shares.) The riskiest niche funds have seen, collectively, $60 billion in inflows … almost none of it from institutional investors. Institutional investors make up two-thirds of the ETF market, but are virtually absent from these sorts of funds. “These strategies are incredibly volatile. They’re 99% owned by retail. There are no institutions allocating these strategies, but there’s billions of dollars coming into them,” he added. (Anna Gleason, “This under-the-radar ETF trend may be flashing a warning signal for the market,” CNBC, Aug 23 2025) How volatile? The YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF is down 52% YTD (per Morningstar, as of 9/8/2025) while its derivative income peers are essentially at zero. Neither soaring prices nor feverish speculation portend a quiet end of the year, though we have no crystal ball. We do have the same suggestion as ever: get ahead of the crisis. Check your investment plan now, not when the howling begins. Recalibrate to a risk level you’re comfortable with. My Indolent Portfolio, at just 50% stocks, has returned a lovely 11.25% so far this year, which strikes me as entirely excellent for a low-drama, low ulcer strategy. Seafarer Capital announced that, effective August 28, 2025, Paul Espinosa was named the firm’s Co-Chief Investment Officer alongside Andrew Foster, its founder. Paul has been the Lead Portfolio Manager of the Seafarer Overseas Value Fund (our profile is here) since its inception (2016) and a Lead Portfolio Manager of the Seafarer Overseas Growth and Income Fund (since 2018). The remainder of the Value team is Mr. Foster and Brent Clayton. Seafarer has divided, thoughtfully, the responsibilities between the two: Mr. Espinosa’s role as risk management lead is reflected in the performance of Seafarer Value. It remains striking to us that, amid a revival of interest in emerging markets, the nine-year-old Seafarer Overseas Value Fund remains such a Star in the Shadows with just $125M AUM (though they’ve seen healthy and well-earned inflows in 2025). That’s against amazing raw and risk-adjusted performance, which earned it MFO Great Owl designation (top 20% risk-adjusted returns across multiple measurement periods) and Morningstar’s five-star and Silver ratings. How amazing? Over the past five years, SFVLX has had the fifth-highest raw returns, the highest Sharpe ratio among all diversified EM equity funds (fifth overall with the four higher being single-country funds), and the lowest Ulcer Index. Over the nine years since inception, its Sharpe ratio is #5 and Ulcer Index remains #1. What does that mean? In a high volatility asset class such as EM equities, a prudent risk manager is an investor’s most critical resource, and Mr. Espinosa has an almost unparalleled record in that regard. The Ulcer Index is a great measure of it. It factors in two values – how far a fund falls at its worst and how long it takes to recover – which together predict how many ulcers the fund will trigger. Of all diversified EM funds, Seafarer has offered the single smoothest ride over both the past 5- and 9-year periods. Put another way: there is SFVLX and then there are 274 bumpier rides available to you, of which at least 270 would earn you less for the privilege. That makes Mr. Espinosa’s promotion and assignment to the lead risk manager role sensible and appropriate. Congratulations. I aspire to match his 95 years rather more than his $95 billion. In particular, I envy his continuing mental acuity at 95. He continues to make sense and continues to read 500 pages a day, reputedly, from biographies and investing books to financial statements. His advice to students: “Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” The folks at Quartz continually admire a trait that few of his contemporaries manage: consistency. They write: What stands out at 95 is the throughline: temperament. Buffett ducked the dot-com bust by ignoring what he didn’t understand, then minted billions from Apple once he could frame it as a consumer staple. He bailed out Wall Street with checks that doubled as confidence votes — and collected billions in dividends and warrants for the trouble. He nearly skipped See’s Candies over a $5 million haggling gap, then used it to bankroll acquisitions for decades. For every Apple there’s a Dexter Shoe, but that’s the point: Fortune doesn’t require perfection, just patience and the temperament to keep compounding. John Conner sent out a provocative email, “Still ‘Investing’ in SNAXX?” (8/7/2025). Mr. Conner is an executive vice president at CrossingBridge and asked this question: Why settle for SNAXX when you really want the whole meal? SNAXX aka the Schwab Money Market Fund, along with “T-bill-and-chill” and other money market funds can be great for short-term cash needs, but investors have increasingly relied on these types of investments for their longer-term allocations. SNAXX are fine when you’re hungry…but you might be starving your portfolio. At CrossingBridge, we think there’s a better option where investors can still prioritize downside risk-management while trying to capture significantly more income. It is very clear that many Americans have noticed that bank savings accounts are the only game in town that guarantees you will lose money. My Old National Bank basic savings kicks out … ready? 0.01% interest in a world where prices are rising (that is, savings are devaluing) at 3% a year. Kiplinger’s reports that “investors have poured into low-risk money market funds” (7/2025) while Morgan Stanley’s annual money market report notes that folks have placed a record $7 trillion in money markets (Money Market Funds 2025 Outlook, 2/2025). They conclude that the trend toward money market, ultra-short-term bond, and high-yield money market funds has intensified since mid-2024 as traditional insured savings accounts have failed to keep pace with inflation or have offered yields below what can be safely achieved elsewhere. Enter CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration Fund. A really extensive analysis shared by CrossingBridge concludes that across a wide range of time windows and risk-return metrics, CBUDX is a stronger candidate for your strategic cash than a really good money market is. Curious, we ran a “strategic cash” search through MFO Premium’s huge data screener. What we found was that CrossingBridge and the funds it advises or sub-advises dominate the top of the list. CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration and RiverPark Short Term High Yield both clocked in with returns greater than 4% a year, maximum drawdowns of 0.1 – o.2% with a recovery time (that is, how long the 0.1 – 0.2% loss persisted before you were in the black again) of two months. Both funds qualify as MFO Great Owl funds for consistently top 20% risk-adjusted returns across various trailing periods. Bottom line: there is some money you have to be able to get right now, today, no delay. That’s “immediate cash.” Put that money in an insured checking account, knowing that you don’t mind if it shrinks a bit because you need 100% liquidity to … you know, buy groceries. “Strategic cash” is intended for situations where a brief delay (a day or two, perhaps a week) is acceptable, allowing for better yields or returns with minimal risk. “You’re gonna need those brakes replaced before the holidays” might be a strategic cash target. At least the research available to us suggests that a money market is better than a savings account for that role, and that the CrossingBridge / RiverPark funds are better than a money market. Only 23% of shareholders have voted on the conversion of Akre Fund to Akre Focus ETF as of our last contact with the adviser. Hmmm … the conversion will likely lower your expenses and your tax bill, guys. It’s worth your while to take the 30 seconds to log in and vote on the matter. Just sayin’.

Reducing my risk profile for accounts that Fidelity manages allows more flexibility in what I manage. In other words, the intermediate investment bucket aggressive sub portfolio that Fidelity manages became more conservative, while I added a little risk to the conservative sub portfolio that I manage. I would like to design a low-risk sub-portfolio that has a low correlation to stocks and bonds, returns about 5%, and has some inflation protection. The objective is to always have at least one fund that is up while still having decent returns. I began with the MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, limited by correlations to the S&P 500 and bonds, low losses for the minimum rolling three-year period, and an MFO Risk rating of average or lower. I trimmed the list using 2022 performance, in which both stocks and bonds did poorly, and the COVID bear market. I found BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) worth further investigation. In this article, I evaluate how a sub-portfolio including PCBAX and BAMBX might be able to meet my objectives. I have already purchased Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) and Aegis Value Fund (AVALX) which David Snowball wrote about in When Reality Bites: Preparing for Market Turbulence Ahead and Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). I already own PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) and include it in this analysis. I finished reading Our Dollar, Your Problem, by Kenneth Rogoff, which left me with more questions than answers, so I bought and am currently reading The Price of Money, by Rob Dix. I also dusted off The Demise of the Dollar, by Addison Wiggin, and Global Macro Trading, by Greg Gliner, which, fortunately, I highlighted when I first read and can skim again in a few hours. Since President Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971, the US has gone through periods of stability, but also the 1970s decade of stagflation, the Great Financial Crisis (2008), Quantitative Easing (2009 to 2014, 2020 to 2021), and the COVID pandemic (2020). Gross Federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has risen from 34% to 120%, and the federal deficit has risen to 6% of GDP. Central banks have been experimenting with their own versions of stablecoin, which may further erode the dominance of the dollar. Domestic stock valuations are high, suggesting below-average long-term returns. I expect higher financial volatility and more frequent periods of inflation in the coming decade(s). I selected the funds in Table #1 to evaluate further. They are sorted from the lowest correlation to the S&P 500 to the highest over the past seven years. Notice that PCBAX has the lowest correlation to both stocks and bonds. BAMBX pays a dividend of 3.8% while PCBAX does not currently have a dividend. PMAIX and FPACX have the potential to increase returns, but at higher risk. PCBAX had a maximum drawdown of 37% during the financial crisis compared to 29% for FPACX. This highlights the benefits of building a diversified portfolio. Table #1: – Fund Candidates – Metrics 7 Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The past decade covers the COVID bear market, Quantitative Easing and Tightening, rising inflation and interest rates, and rising valuations of the S&P 500. In particular, I am interested in how funds performed during the COVID bear market and 2022, when stocks and bonds did poorly. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX), BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), and Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) performed well during these two periods. Figure 1 – Fund Candidates Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted monthly returns for the past ten years for these funds using the MFO Premium fund screener. I selected periods with at least three months where stocks had negative returns, bonds had negative returns, and both stocks and bonds had negative returns. The results are contained in Table #2. Table 2 – Cumulative Returns During Stock and Bond Downturns – 10 Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) has a lower correlation to stocks and bonds than BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX). Returns are similar, but PCBAX does not pay a dividend. BAMBX appears to outperform PCBAX when both stocks and bonds are positive, while PCBAX appears to outperform when neither stocks nor bonds are doing well. PMAIX is less correlated to the S&P500 than FPACX and is a little less risky, but has lower returns than FPACX. FPA Crescent Fund is available with Fidelity in two share classes: FPACX with a $49.95 transaction fee and 1.06% expense ratio, and FPFRX without a transaction fee and 1.15% expense ratio. I don’t own the FPA Crescent Fund, but I want to purchase it at some point. I wanted a little help evaluating a low-risk portfolio that is uncorrelated to stocks and bonds and returns 5%. I selected the funds in Table #3 as inputs in Portfolio Visualizer. The link is provided here. I selected the time period from January 2018 to December 2023 to capture the COVID bear market 2022, in which stocks and bonds did poorly, but excluded 2024, where stock market valuation increased significantly. Table 3 – Funds Selected for Portfolio Visualizer Optimization Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #4 shows the results of the optimization for maximum return at 6% volatility, maximum Sharpe ratio, and a simple allocation of my own. All three had returns of 4.8% to 6.1% with drawdowns of 8.7% to 13.1%. Table 4 – Portfolio Visualizer Results Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #2 shows the results graphically adjusted for inflation. The drawdowns can be reduced by adding both BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) without the return suffering significantly. Figure 2 – Portfolio Visualizer Results Adjusted for Inflation Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #5 contains the correlation matrix of the funds. Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX), Aegis Value Fund (AVALX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and FPA Crescent Fund (FPACX) have correlations close to each other, which reduces their ability to diversify a portfolio. Table 5 – Asset Correlations Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) About this Fund: Investment Approach: The BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund is a diversified alternative strategy that seeks to provide total return comprised of current income and capital appreciation in both periods of strong market returns and periods of market stress. Investors Who Might Be Interested in BAMBX: BlackRock’s systematic alternative strategies seek differentiated risk and return profiles with a low correlation to broad asset classes to help diversify portfolios. Blackrock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX): About this Fund: Investment Approach: The BlackRock Tactical Opportunities Fund is a macro strategy that tactically allocates across global markets and asset classes and has achieved lowly correlated, stable growth. Investors Who Might Be Interested in PCBAX: An alternative multi-asset strategy might be a good fit for investors seeking differentiated risk and return profiles with low correlation to broad asset classes to help diversify 60/40 portfolios. My conservative intermediate sub portfolio that I manage consists of bond ladders, short- and intermediate-duration bond funds. I have been shifting to a barbell approach, moving short-term bond funds into those with intermediate durations in order to lock in higher yields. My withdrawal strategy is to withdraw 4% from this sub portfolio when stocks are not performing well and more aggressive sub-portfolios when stocks are doing well. At this point, as bond ladders mature, I favor BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) over BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) as a long-term investment because it is more conservative and pays a dividend. PCBAX has been outperforming BAMBX year-to-date. I don’t expect to make changes until closer to the end of the year and will continue to monitor both.

We wrote last month about the plan to convert Akre Focus Fund into an ETF (“Enduring Principles, Evolving Markets,” 8/2025), a move that would benefit shareholders by increasing interest in the portfolio, reducing expenses, and controlling taxes. That plan encountered a stumbling block: fund shareholders have not bestirred themselves to cast their vote (up or down) on the change proposal. According to the adviser’s rep, only 23% of shares have been voted, which requires an expensive second round of solicitations in hopes of reaching the 50.1% threshold. If you are an Akre shareholder, vote! You received paper notifications and will see something comparable if you log in to your account. If you’re an RIA and your clients hold Akre shares, encourage them to take two minutes to lower their fees and tax bill. This is, by the way, a common problem for advisers and explains the increasingly common practice of writing prospectuses that exclude the necessity of shareholder action. The Aberdeen Group has announced plans to convert abrdn International Small Cap Fund to abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF (ASCI) and abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income Fund into abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF (AMUN). Tax-free, lower fees, all the usual stuff. Fans continue to hope that the firm will save enough money to be able to buy an “e”. Baron Capital has filed registration filings for its first exchange-traded funds: In addition, Baron Fin Tech ($70 million AUM, three-star, low risk, below-average return, per Morningstar) and Technology (five-star, $100 million AUM, high return, above-average risk) funds are being converted into ETFs. Annual fees have not been stated at this time. The reorganizations are expected to be completed on or about December 12. T. Rowe Price has filed its registration statement for the following ETFs: The ETFs will be co-managed by numerous T. Rowe Price investment advisors; expenses have not been stated as of this writing. Vanguard has registered three active fundamental stock exchange-traded funds. Vanguard Wellington Dividend Growth Active ETF (VDIG), Vanguard Wellington U.S. Growth Active ETF (VUSG), and Vanguard Wellington U.S. Value Active ETF (VUSV) are in registration. The expense ratios for VDIG, VUSG, and VUSV will be .40%, .35% and .30%, respectively. VUSV will be managed by David Palmer, who manages the Vanguard Windsor fund; VUSG will be managed by Michael Masdea and Brian Barbetta, both of whom manage the Vanguard Global Equity fund; and VDIG will be managed by Peter Fisher, who manages the Vanguard Dividend Growth fund. Oakmark has submitted an initial registration statement for three ETFs: Oakmark International Large Cap, Oakmark Global Large Cap, and Oakmark U.S. Concentrated ETFs. Expenses have not been stated for any of the ETFs at this time. Anthony P. Coniaris, CFA, David G. Herro, CFA, and Eric Liu, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of the Oakmark International Large Cap ETF. Anthony P. Coniaris, CFA, David G. Herro, CFA, M. Colin Hudson, CFA, Eric Liu, CFA, and John A. Sitarz, CFA, CPA, will be the portfolio managers of the Oakmark Global Large Cap ETF. Robert F. Bierig and Alexander E. Fitch, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of Oakmark U.S. Concentrated ETF. The Carillon Chartwell Small Cap fund will not be merged into the Carillon Chartwell Small Cap Growth fund. No reason was stated for the change of heart. T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock Fund and its institutional sibling are opening to new investors on September 30th for investors who invest directly with T. Rowe Price. The fund was closed to new investors on January 2, 2014, due to its assets surpassing $10 billion under management. The fund was previously closed in 2004, only to reopen in 2009 with significant asset gathering over the years. Brown Advisory – WMC Strategic European Equity fund closed to new investors on August 8th. Effective on or about October 13, 2025, Amplify High Income ETF will change to the Amplify CEF High Income ETF. On October 14, 2025, the BlackRock Liquid Federal Trust Fund becomes the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund. The new fund will narrow its strategy to invest 100% in U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities of three months or less and overnight repos. Pending shareholder approval, DoubleLine Floating Rate will be merged with and into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund sometime in Q4, 2025. Odd, on face. The DoubleLine version is both larger and has a substantially stronger three-year record. Effective October 1, 2025, five Russell ETFs will drop the word “Active” from their names. There are the U.S. Small Cap Equity Active ETF, International Developed Equity Active, Global Equity Active ETF, Emerging Markets Equity Active ETF, and Global Infrastructure Active ETF. There’s nothing in the filing to suggest that the ETFs will become less active, just that they won’t own the term anymore. Odd. Pending shareholder approval (vote, people, vote!), the two STF funds will soon become Hennessy funds. STF Tactical Growth & Income ETF would become a shareholder of the Hennessy Tactical Growth and Income ETF, and the shareholders of the STF Tactical Growth ETF would become shareholders of the Hennessy Tactical Growth ETF. Which requires that the aforementioned shareholders get off their duffs and vote their proxy. Anchor Risk Managed Global Strategies fund will be liquidated on or about August 28th. BNY Mellon Dynamic Total Return fund will be liquidated on or about October 24th. Calamos Dividend Growth fund is being reorganized into the Calamos Growth and Income fund on or about August 29th. The Federated Hermes Short-Term Government Fund will be closed to new accounts on October 1st (why not now, do you suppose?) and will be liquidated on October 4, 2025. Issachar Fund (founder on one of the 12 tribes of Israel, the name translates to “there is a reward,” check below for details) will cease operations on or about September 29, 2025. Kind of a cool lion’s head logo (the manager is named Lyons) paired with a 3.5% expense ratio, 1500% turnover ratio, a 75% cash stake, and 1.7% APR over 10 years. JPMorgan Climate Change Solutions ETF will be liquidated on or about October 10th. Jackson Square has proposed merging its Jackson Square Large-Cap Growth Fund and Jackson Square SMID-Cap Growth Fund with and into the $1 billion Spyglass Growth Fund, notwithstanding the fact that Spyglass doesn’t invest in small- to mid-cap stocks. Spyglass is concentrated, socially conscious, and led by a former Edgewood Growth manager. Nice people. Southern Asset Management is merging its Longleaf International fund into its Longleaf Global fund. A shareholder vote will occur; if the reorganization is approved, it will occur before or during December 2025. Mirova International Megatrends fund was liquidated on August 19th. NexPoint Climate Tech Fund has closed to new investors and will be liquidated on or about Sept 2, 2025 Vontobel Global Environmental Change fund was liquidated on or about August 29th. WPG Partners Select Hedged fund will be liquidated on or about August 28th. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Photo: Jennie Cotter A Dublin community-led charity run, organised yesterday in solidarity with Gaza, has raised more than €18,000 in donations. The 60km route stretched along the Dublin coastline - from Blackrock to Raheny Dart stations – symbolising the 60km boundary line dividing Gaza and Israel. Participants could walk or run the distance and join at different points, as the route was divided into four 15km sections with staggered start times to reflect the full boundary line. The charity was organised in support of Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and has already raised over €18,000, surpassing the target of €6,000 by 300pc, as donations are still coming in.

Photo: Jennie Cotter Today's News in 90 seconds - 8th September 2025 Actress and comedian Norma Sheahan supported participants as they left and returned to Blackrock, before running from Raheny back to Blackrock herself. She described the atmosphere at the event as "magic" and "full of heart, grit, and community spirit". "It was a day of connection and kindness, proving that no matter how far away Gaza may feel, we can stand in solidarity and make a real difference," she said. "Every step was a message to families in Gaza that they’re not alone and not forgotten," she added. Funds raised through the event will go directly to MAP, a humanitarian charity associated with Trócaire, delivering urgent medical care, food and shelter to families in Gaza. Donations will help provide lifesaving equipment, such as respiratory cannulas for children, intravenous drip bags for patients in cardiac arrest and antibiotics. Runners came together for the Gaza solidarity run on Sunday. Photo: Jennie Cotter Aibhín Bray, the organiser of the run, said: "We started as a small group of friends who felt utterly helpless watching the situation in Gaza." "What happened yesterday was extraordinary - people of all ages and backgrounds came together to walk, run, cheer, donate and volunteer. "It was beyond anything we could have imagined. It shows that even when the situation feels overwhelming, hope can grow when a community comes together and that each of us has the power to step forward and make a meaningful difference. “We are deeply grateful to every single person who contributed – whether they ran, walked, volunteered, donated or simply cheered along the route. Every act of kindness made this possible," she added. Donations can still be made through the JustGiving fundraising link "Run for their Lives: Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP)". The description of the fundraiser reads: "We are a group of running friends who are heartbroken by the forced starvation of children and adults in Gaza, and we can no longer stand silent and do nothing." "Please join us on Sunday for a powerful act of solidarity and support," it added. Runners at the Gaza solidarity run. Photo: Jennie Cotter Runners at the Gaza solidarity run.

Title: European Crypto Giant CoinShares Plans US Market Entry with $1.2B Merger
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-crypto-giant-coinshares-plans-us-market-entry-with-1-2b-merger/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T20:12:32Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CoinShares International Limited announced a definitive $1.2 billion business combination agreement with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. to list on US Nasdaq by December 2025. CoinShares International Limited announced on September 8 its entry into a definitive business combination agreement with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, that will result in the European asset manager listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States. The transaction values CoinShares at $1.2 billion on a pre-money basis, positioning the company as one of the largest publicly traded digital asset managers globally. The merger is supported by a $50 million anchor investment from an institutional investor. The deal enables CoinShares to transition its listing from Nasdaq Stockholm to the US market, where over half of global assets under management are located. CoinShares currently manages approximately $10 billion in assets and ranks as the fourth-largest global provider of crypto exchange-traded products after BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity. In Europe, CoinShares holds the number one position with a 34% market share. The company has experienced significant growth, with assets under management more than tripling over the past two years, driven by strong investor inflows and the success of new product launches. Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and co-founder of CoinShares, described the transaction as “far more than a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States” but rather “a strategic transition for CoinShares, accelerating our ambition for global leadership.” “The US is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry,” Mognetti stated in the press release. The move comes amid unprecedented growth in the crypto ETP market. Global crypto ETP assets under management surged to $134.5 billion by Q4 2024, representing a 950% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The crypto asset management market has grown from $857.09 million in 2023 to $1.06 billion in 2024 and is expected to continue expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 24.61% through 2030. In the second quarter of 2025, CoinShares reported net profit of $32.4 million and asset management fees of $30.0 million. The company’s diversified product suite includes 32 crypto exchange-traded products across multiple platforms, covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other digital assets. Moreover, with these achievements, the company continued its expansion in the EU. In July, CoinShares secured a MiCA license to offer crypto services across Europe. The financial regulator of France granted the permit. Under the agreement, CoinShares and Vine Hill shareholders will exchange their securities for shares in a new combined company, Odysseus Holdings Limited. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The boards of both CoinShares and Vine Hill have unanimously approved the business combination. Following completion, CoinShares intends to delist from Nasdaq Stockholm, with the new entity expected to begin trading on the US Nasdaq by December 18, 2025. One thing is certain: now is the best moment for any crypto company that offers services to institutional clients, with many businesses going public and experiencing global growth. CoinShares is one of many examples today. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Nasdaq Files SEC Proposal to Enable Tokenized Securities Trading
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/nasdaq-files-sec-proposal-to-enable-tokenized-securities-trading/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T18:39:29Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Nasdaq submitted an SEC filing to allow trading of tokenized equities and ETPs on its exchange, potentially reducing settlement times and market friction through blockchain integration. Nasdaq took a step toward blending blockchain with traditional finance on Sept. 8, 2025, by submitting a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. The move aims to let member firms and investors trade tokenized versions of equities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Nasdaq Stock Market. According to a LinkedIn post by Nasdaq President Tal Cohen, this integration could reduce friction in markets, speed up settlement times, and automate processes. Cohen noted the filing seeks to leverage US equities’ strengths, like robust oversight and investor safeguards, to scale blockchain benefits responsibly. Details from Nasdaq’s newsroom Q&A reveal how the system would work. Participants could choose tokenized or traditional forms at order entry, with the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) handling clearing and settlement for tokens. According to Chuck Mack, Nasdaq’s Senior Vice President of North American Markets, the exchange anticipates that blockchain integration will streamline trading operations by reducing settlement times, improving transaction transparency, and creating a more seamless process from order execution to final clearing. “Nasdaq’s proposed rule changes would enable member firms and investors to trade tokenized versions of equity securities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) on our markets. Our goal is to integrate digital assets into Nasdaq’s current infrastructure and systems, which will advance financial innovation while maintaining stability, fairness, and investor protection,” said Mack. Mack explained that tokenized securities are digital representations on blockchain, but they hold the same value and rights as non-tokenized shares. This avoids creating separate markets that could dilute liquidity or transparency. The filing opens for public comment, inviting industry input. Nasdaq views it as part of a broader evolution, responding to demand for innovation while prioritizing capital formation and market integrity. This aligns with growing tokenization trends, as seen in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund on Ethereum and platforms like Robinhood offering tokenized stocks in Europe. Tokenization has gained traction since 2022, when the RWA market hovered around $5 billion, focusing on basic assets like stablecoins. By 2023, growth hit 308%, reaching $15 billion, with pilots from firms like Centrifuge enabling multichain RWAs, according to market reports. In 2024, institutions accelerated adoption: BlackRock launched its BUIDL Treasury fund on Ethereum in March, surpassing $500 million by mid-year. Fidelity tokenized similar products, while the World Economic Forum noted potential for cross-border efficiency. By Sept. 2025, the market exceeds $24 billion, up 380% from 2022. Recent moves include Ondo Finance tokenizing over 100 US stocks and ETFs on Ethereum and Trust Wallet integrating tokenized equities for millions of users. Headline Today: Trust Wallet (200M+ users) brings tokenized U.S. stocks & ETFs on-chain, powered by Ondo + 1inch The tokenization wave isn’t slowing down.Every week, new moves show how close we are to a future where real-world assets live fully on-chain. Here’s what’s fresh… pic.twitter.com/pvO6P5zbsi — Bellasuga (@HARDAY_DANIEL) September 4, 2025 Nasdaq’s proposal parallels these developments, bridging TradFi with DeFi by tokenizing listed securities, much like Robinhood’s EU platform offering 24/5 tokenized stock trading since early 2025.

Δ The company announced Monday (Sept. 8) that it had entered into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) agreement that will see CoinShares list on the Nasdaq, valuing it at $1.2 billion. Following the agreement, CoinShares will delist from the Swedish market. Jean-Marie Mognetti, co-founder and CEO of CoinShares, said the transaction marks an effort by the company to achieve “global leadership” amid a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto. “The case for digital assets as an investment class and blockchain as a transformative technology has reached a decisive inflection point and can no longer be ignored. There is no going back,” he said. “The U.S. is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry.” The company said in the release said that it is the fourth-largest manager of digital asset ETP products globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and the top manager in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a 34% market share. The company also has roughly $10 billion in assets under management, a figure that has tripled in the last two years. CoinShares said it has also gone from a single platform with four products in 2021 to a 32-product suite spread across four platforms. CoinShares is among several crypto firms that have made an effort to go public on the U.S. markets this year, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or SPAC deals. This is happening as the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, embraces the crypto sector after years of regulatory crackdown. Among the companies to already list are Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which had a blockbuster IPO earlier this year. The crypto exchange Bullish enjoyed similar success when it went public last month. “With Circle’s entry into the public market, a new chapter looks set to begin,” PYMNTS wrote June 5. “With blue-chip banks underwriting the deal and retail investors clamoring for shares, the traditional finance world appears more open than ever to embracing digital assets. Or, at least, the potentially regulated and transparent kind of digital assets.” Still to come is the IPO from crypto exchange Gemini, which said last week it is targeting a $2.1 valuation when it goes public.
