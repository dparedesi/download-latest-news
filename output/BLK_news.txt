Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs. Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin. Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry. But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. 1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. 2. Making history with pizza Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! 3. Becoming legal tender In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. 4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. 5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." 6. Crypto King fraudster No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. 7. Investment bank boom Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen arrested in February, will be allowed abroad to seek medical treatment. Habibur Rahman was charged with running the machine without registration from the FCA. The agreement will put an end to a saga that started when the firm went bankrupt in November 2022. The collection was considered a virtual asset and could not be released, Guernsey Post says. Crypto currency firms are waiting to see how November's vote will impact upon them. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Title: Trump hurls bitcoin near $90,000 — will the rally endure?

Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged without restraint. The President-elect intentionally courted the bitcoin community. But can he make good on his promises? The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was trading near $90,000 (€85,780) on Tuesday, reaching a new high. The record rally began on November 4 after Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the next US president. Jonas Groß, chairman of the Digital Euro Association — an organization that promotes digital payment systems — says Trump has declared himself to be the "crypto president" who will "lead the US to a pioneering role in bitcoin." Such promises have been made so far only by presidents of smaller countries, like [President Nayib Bukele of] El Salvador, Groß told DW. "It's no surprise that the crypto community is celebrating." Though Trump had previously harbored a negative opinion about the cryptocurrency, he suddenly made a U-turn during the 2024 election campaign. At a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, for example, he promised to keep the crypto market largely unregulated and to make energy cheaper for the power-hungry mining of cryptocurrencies. Generating new bitcoins and maintaining the so-called blockchain network on which all transactions are recorded requires significant energy. Co-Pierre Georg, director of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, attributes bitcoin's price surge primarily to "structural factors amplified by the US election." Georg told DW that the approval by US market regulators in January of so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in bitcoin made investing in the coin and other cryptocurrencies much easier. With ETFs, investors can profit from price movements by buying shares without owning bitcoin directly. Georg noted that since regulatory approval, huge amounts of money have flowed into such ETFs, indicating that mainly institutional investors, like the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, are fueling the rally. He said that direct purchases of bitcoin via crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpanda, or Kraken haven't fundamentally changed so much recently. Jonas Groß believes, however, that bitcoin's new all-time high mainly reflects sentiment and trust, similar to other publicly traded assets. While financial fraud dominated the headlines regarding bitcoin in the past, "it just needed a reason to lift spirits and get the machinery running again." Trump's soft regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies has "brought positive sentiment back," he added. Bitcoin's most prominent foe in the US administration is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, a staunch advocate of sweeping cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, Co-Pierre Georg expects Trump to try to reorganize the agency overseeing US financial markets but said the incoming president can't simply replace Gensler without proving specific errors. Georg also sees Trump's win as a victory for the crypto industry lobby. "At the moment, it appears that the industry has bought influence over the government and the new Congress," he said in a reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest man has proven an ardent fan of both cryptocurrencies and Donald Trump, whose campaign he supported with millions of dollars. According to news agency Reuters, the crypto industry spent nearly $120 million on support for Trump and Republican candidates, with a significant portion of the funding dedicated to unseat Senate Banking Committee chairman and crypto critic Sherrod Brown from the Democrats. The campaign of Brown's Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, was reportedly supported with industry donations of about $40 million. While in the past, bitcoin broke records mainly in the wake of major companies accepting it as payment, such as PayPal in 2020, Georg sees "no such reasons" at the moment. "Bitcoin is completely unsuitable for payments, and it's also not reliable as a stable investment. The only real reason to buy bitcoin is speculative." Jonas Groß is less skeptical, seeing some market fundamentals currently favoring the asset. "Bitcoin has established itself as a new asset class. The first pension funds are already investing, and in my view, it's only a matter of time before the first sovereign wealth funds enter the space. And then we're talking about an entirely different scale," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Noting that markets have already "priced in Trump's promises," he warned, however: "If it turns out he doesn't deliver, prices could of course fall again." For Co-Pierre Georg, predicting if the rally will continue under Trump is "like reading tea leaves." With bitcoin, he said, "you should only invest what you're prepared to lose completely." Moreover, he's wondering about the crypto industry and what it says that it "so strongly supports the election of a convicted criminal and political firebrand like Donald Trump, and then massively profits from his win."

Title: Welcome to the Donald Trump Era of Crypto

On Monday morning, the research firm Bernstein came out with some advice about crypto for its Wall Street clients: “Buy everything you can.” Ever since the invention of bitcoin 15 years ago, this would be the kind of bloodshot, crazy-eyed call you could ignore because it was coming from a fanatic. But Bernstein is not some crypto-pilled boiler-room operation. Rather, it is part of the staid French investment bank Societe Generale and traces its history back to the 1960s, when the U.S. was still on the gold standard. The paper immediately ricocheted around the finance industry. When I started writing this column, bitcoin was testing new highs above $82,000; by the time I finished, it had eclipsed $88,000. When you look at the sheer volume of trading, it was probably crypto’s biggest day ever. Welcome to crypto’s Donald Trump era. It has hardly been a week since Trump won election, but it looks increasingly likely that the next four years in cryptoland are going to make the time when Sam Bankman-Fried was the industry’s fuzzy-headed mascot appear tame by comparison. What happened? It is not that there was some mass conversion event among Wall Street’s most cynical moneymen to the utopian promises of the digital future. There has been no new invention, no new use discovered that would make bitcoin or any other digital currency more likely to be a part of your everyday life. The calculus here is that all the insanity of the pandemic-era boom can come back in force — and this time, like Trump, the industry is emboldened to get even bigger, richer, and more unabashed than it ever has before. There’s no guarantee that bitcoin, or any other digital token, will be worth more tomorrow than it is right now. Volatility and sky-high risk is a central part of investing in crypto, and that didn’t change on November 6. But crypto in 2025 is looking like it is the industry’s best chance to make itself into something bigger than just a financial sideshow — for the next four years, the industry is absolutely looking to make itself institutional. The coming Trump economy, if it looks anything like the last one, is going to be very good for business, with lower taxes and interest rates, freeing up more money for people to speculate. And the industry has already made it as easy to buy crypto as anything else available on the New York Stock Exchange. Which, broadly speaking, has meant more money coming into the space, bringing rising prices and dampened volatility. Ever since this winter, when regulators allowed 401(k) money to flow into bitcoin ETFs, giants like BlackRock have been acting as a bridge between the traditional and digital worlds of finance — which has, in turn, only served to make crypto that much larger. The biggest break from the Biden administration, though, is likely going to be how much the industry is going to police itself. That is at least partly a function of an extremely aggressive lobbying campaign. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — the largest U.S. crypto exchange — made a wager that he could marshal more than $100 million from his industry to elect a crypto-friendly government — and he ended up with a historic streak of wins that rivals some of the all-time great Wall Street trades. Bloomberg tallies that out of the 48 races where crypto money was backing a candidate, the industry has won every single won. (There are eight remaining, and all but three seem to be breaking toward the industry). Washington, D.C.’s most powerful bulwarks against the industry, including Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, are losing their jobs. The winners, like Brown’s successor Bernie Moreno, are openly pushing for crypto to get the laissez-faire treatment. One senator, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, has introduced a bill that would require the Treasury to buy and hold onto a “strategic reserve” of 1 million bitcoins for 20 years — putting the U.S. more in line with El Salvador, which has tried, and mostly failed, to integrate the asset into everyday life. It’s not just lawmakers. Howard Lutnick, who is overseeing Trump’s personnel staffing, is the CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald — which just happens to be where Tether, the lifeblood stablecoin of the crypto industry, keeps its money. Elon Musk, who bankrolled at least $119 million of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations, is a major crypto proponent — especially the joke dogecoin — and Tesla owns vast stores of bitcoin. (His vow to oversee a Department Of Government Efficiency to root out public spending is, I am sorry to say, a crypto joke). Of course, the first Trump administration oversaw a wild crypto bull market in 2017 and, at the time, prosecuted plenty of scams and frauds. What the crypto industry complains the most about these days is that the federal government doesn’t make crypto-specific rules, and that it uses the courts to set policy. Nevermind that this practice originated under Trump, back when he wrote he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” But since July, when Trump promised at the annual bitcoin conference to ax Gensler and make the U.S. the global center of crypto, his late-in-life conversion was accepted by the industry without much of a second thought. This is essentially what Bernstein and many others on Wall Street are excited about: putting money into a relatively new asset class now that regulators and federal prosecutors seem ready to let it grow. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, a tech company that holds $10 billion in bitcoin, went vertical on Monday. The total market for all of crypto was within a breath of reaching $3 trillion — about the size of France’s economy. In fact, the only digital asset to lose money among the largest 100 was Monero — a cryptocurrency favored by the likes of North Korea because it is so useful for laundering large sums of money. (The first Trump administration had prosecuted a multi-decade low of white-collar crimes, after all, so it’s not clear that money laundering would be much of a priority.) Last year, the Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux (who’s a friend of mine) published a book called Number Go Up about the various scams and frauds that crypto facilitates. The title of the book comes from a quote by Dan Held, an executive at a crypto exchange, who was quoting — in earnest, apparently — a sarcastic meme about crypto. “Number go up technology is a very powerful piece of technology,” he said, according to the book. “It’s the price. As the price goes higher, more people are aware of it, and buy it in anticipation of the price continuing to climb.” Of course, what he’s describing has paved the way for many of the Ponzi-esque schemes that have defined the crypto industry so far, not least of which was the collapse of SBF’s crypto empire. (Not for nothing, FTX, his exchange, was based in the Bahamas, which has notoriously hands-off and crypto-friendly laws. They’ve since backtracked.) Crypto’s doubters have continued to make the same case against it over and over again: that digital assets make for a slow and expensive form of money, and that their best use is either in speculation or crime. Perhaps, over the long run, all this speculation will make for another FTX-like crash — this one even bigger than the last one. But for now, the crypto bros are going to go absolutely ape.

Rising Bitcoin ETF investments signal institutional FOMO and market confidence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted $3.4 billion in inflows over the past four days, according to Farside data. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, reported significant investments in their Bitcoin ETFs, indicating heightened institutional interest. On Nov. 7, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF saw an inflow of $1.12 billion, marking the largest single-day investment among the ETFs listed. These inflows come in the wake of the US Election, in which Donald Trump’s victory helped push Bitcoin toward $90,000. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also recorded notable inflows since the election of $666 million and $178 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued to attract investments, adding $61 million. Other financial firms, such as Ark Invest, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree, contributed to the rising inflows. On Nov. 11, Ark’s ARKB ETF received $42.7 million, while Invesco’s BTCO added $108.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with $756 million. These firms’ participation underlines a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial markets. Substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect growing confidence among institutional investors in cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Possible FOMO among US investors who have seen adverts from the likes of BlackRock, Bitwise, et al over the past year could also be impacting investments as Trump’s reelection spurs increased attention to the digital asset.

Title: Here are 33 places to eat in Ireland that readers say are good value

When it comes to highlighting rip-offs, Pricewatch is not to be found wanting – we hope – but we believe it is also important to support local businesses and to acknowledge that there are many, many restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels all over the country that are offering good value for money in very difficult circumstances. These businesses are also bringing jobs and money and life into all our communities unlike, say, many of the blue chip big tech companies that concentrate their presence in and around big urban centres. And the hospitality sector does more than that. It is also a magnet for the millions of tourists who travel to Ireland, not many of whom complain about rip-off prices, incidentally. Bearing all that in mind, we took to the platform formerly known as Twitter last week and asked people for examples of good value across the hospitality sector. We were heartened by the volume of responses and positivity that flowed our way. Here is just a sample of what came back. Blackrock Market: Lebanese Tapas offers delicious home-made Falafel and hummus. Really good value and the best coffee too. – Elaine Banfield Pizzas of Heart, Youghal: A young family from Naples giving us great value for money. €10-€13 for an oven fired freshly made pizza. They work out of their own mobile kitchen which changes location from the beach to the GAA club. – Michael John Howard Kenny’s pub on James’s Street, Dublin: Went there on a random Monday earlier this year. Pint of Guinness was only €5 and there was not one but two Elvis impersonators. – Ian Begley Timeless Cafe in Kilcock: Lunch for four yesterday including drinks and coffee was €40. Don’t get that value around these parts often. – Meadhbh Charles Sligo: Three tapas dishes for €12 at Osta Cafe and excellent (free) music Thursday evenings. And across the river, low price menu at Oak Moon evening cafe Thursday to Saturday. – Richard O’Beirne Stranorlar: Our local Kees Hotel has great offers including B&B plus dinner for €56 per person sharing. – Angela Holohan Gorey, Co Wexford: Partridges on Main Street.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Almost $90,000 During Face-Melting Rally

Bitcoin prices neared the $90,000 price level today. Bitcoin prices continued their sharp, upward trajectory on Monday, November 11, approaching $90,000 as the world’s most prominent digital currency attained its latest all-time high. The cryptocurrency, which has been generating substantial visibility and widespread headlines for several years now, reached $89,600, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. To provide an idea of just how rapidly the cryptocurrency has been appreciating over the last several weeks, it was trading close to $62,000 roughly a month ago, additional TradingView figures reveal. Since dropping to that point, the digital asset has rallied more than 40%. Chris Chung, CEO & co-founder of Solana DEX aggregator Titan, emphasized just how strong bitcoin’s upward trend has been lately. “Bitcoin’s all time high and momentum shows no signs of stopping, as continued optimism surrounding the results of the U.S. election continue to drive price movement,” he stated via email. “Traders are deploying their capital and flocking to the safest asset that they are certain will stay around regardless of any drops in the market,” Chung added. The TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O also weighed in. “Bitcoin keeps breaking all time highs since last week, this caused a full blown crypto bull market to begin!” she said through emailed comments. Bitcoin prices are benefiting from multiple tailwinds, and Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of Bitpanda, offered his views on this situation. When asked what fueled the latest gains, he replied simply that “It’s a combination of factors.” “The election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States was a key event, both because the uncertainty of the election is now over and because of the promises he made to the crypto industry during his campaign,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad emphasized via email. “Added to that, we have seen record ETF inflows, significant capital entering the crypto space from capital markets, falling interest rates, and a surge in interest from retail investors,” he noted. “The fact that a new all-time high was reached over the weekend suggests that the current price increase is driven mainly by heightened demand from retail investors rather than institutional ones. If this demand persists, we could see further price increases for some time,” the executive stated. Going forward, the analysts polled for this article offered optimistic price forecasts. Wendy O, in particular, seemed confident that bitcoin would reach a six-figure valuation before the year is through. “Personally it seems very likely Bitcoin could see $100,000 prior to 2025 as BlackRock IBIT is creating insane demand for the finite asset Bitcoin, with only 21 million ever made, $85,000 Bitcoin may just be the beginning,” she stated earlier in the day.

While the world’s largest crypto broke above $89,500 on Monday, crypto-related stocks are also in for the ride—namely America’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase. The San Francisco-based company’s shares (COIN: NASDAQ) closed Monday’s trading session at $334.24, Google Finance data shows. That’s a nearly 20% rise in the past 24 hours and close to an 84% jump over the past month. After-hours trading shows the stock is up a further 1% to $327.40. The digital asset giant isn’t far off touching its debut price of $381 when the company went public during the prior bull run, set roughly three years ago. Analysts are now forecasting a high price target for the stock of around $380 over a 12-month horizon—with nine experts recommending to buy and eight advising to hold, according to TipRanks data. Coinbase not only allows users to buy and sell major coins and tokens, but the company, which went public in 2021, also provides custody and other services to nearly all the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, including Wall Street heavyweight BlackRock. Since crypto-friendly Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week, the stock has jumped 67%. President-elect Donald Trump became a cheerleader for Bitcoin and the digital asset industry during his campaign for the White House. He has vowed to allow all future Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. and for the country to become the “crypto capital of the planet.” His rhetoric prompted a “Trump trade,” with investors scooping up tech stocks and crypto before and after the election. Coinbase stock isn’t the only Bitcoin proxy to be up big: software company and now “Bitcoin development” firm MicroStrategy’s shares hit an all-time high of $351 today. The company is the largest publicly traded holder of the asset.

Title: Bitcoin BTC’s Price Surge to New All-Time High: Will the Bullish Trend Continue?

Written by Rida Fatima Crypto Journalist Fact Checked by Asad Gilani Crypto Editor Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Bitcoin recently surged to a new all-time high, fueling excitement across the crypto market. After breaking the strong resistance around $73,600 on November 6, Bitcoin has been gracefully soaring to new heights, clinching an all-time high of $76,228. Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s price broke this ATH yesterday, surging to over $82,000 and reaching 82,657 today, November 11. As the broader market reels in bullish sentiment, altcoins soar to new highs, with analysts predicting a possible Bitcoin surge to $100,000 before the year ends. Technical indicators point to further gains, suggesting that Bitcoin’s bullish trend could last in the coming days. But the big question is: Will the current momentum be sustained? This analysis will explore Bitcoin’s next possible moves as market momentum builds. Bitcoin has recently crossed above its Bollinger Band, signaling a strong bullish trend. Breaking above the upper Bollinger Band typically indicates increased buying pressure and potential for a continued upward movement. If Bitcoin manages to sustain this level, it could establish a strong support zone around the upper band, helping to maintain its current momentum. Additionally, Bitcoin remains above its bullish trendline, reinforcing the positive trend we’ve seen recently. Key support zones around the trendline have consistently pushed Bitcoin’s price higher. Also, the MACD is above the signal line with green histogram bars, signaling intense buying pressure. The above chart shows that Bitcoin BTC’s price recently broke out of its “fallen wedge” channel. This breakout is significant because the falling wedge pattern indicates that selling pressure is weakening. To confirm the bullish momentum, BTC retested the wedge’s upper boundary. When combined with other indicators, the current rally looks strong. So, there’s a strong possibility that Bitcoin’s bullish trend will extend further. MicroStrategy has just acquired 27,200 Bitcoin for $2 billion, co-founder Michael Saylor announced today, November 11. This purchase increases the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 279,420 BTC, valued at $11.9 billion. With Bitcoin hitting all-time highs, MicroStrategy’s investment is now seeing unrealized gains of over $10 billion. Saylor also revealed that the company achieved a 7.3% BTC yield quarter-to-date and 26.4% year-to-date. This massive purchase solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as one of the largest Bitcoin holders, ranking fifth after Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, and Grayscale. This purchase is a strong signal to the market, boosting overall confidence. When a major company like MicroStrategy increases its Bitcoin holdings, it attracts more buyers and investors. The timing of this acquisition, as Bitcoin is reaching new all-time highs, further strengthens the bullish market sentiment. Many investors may now view Bitcoin as an asset with long-term potential, especially seeing big players like MicroStrategy making significant moves. Veteran trader Peter Brandt predicts Bitcoin could surge to $250,000, highlighting a bullish breakout on the multi-year chart. He pointed to the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, often signaling strong upward momentum. Brandt compared Bitcoin’s current price action to spot Gold after a similar breakout, which saw significant gains. Though this forecast is for the long term, it has added to the growing bullish sentiment in the market. Such predictions often attract more buyers, driving prices higher as confidence in Bitcoin grows. The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with new projects, and one gaining significant attention is FreeDum Fighters (DUM). While Bitcoin’s potential rally is exciting, many investors are shifting focus to FreeDum Fighters ($DUM). Some believe $DUM could yield significant returns when it goes live. For those who may have missed Bitcoin’s early days, this could be the perfect time to explore emerging alternatives. This political-themed token quickly becomes a favorite in the emerging “PolitiFi” space. So far, it has raised over $468,000 in presale funding, reflecting growing investor interest ahead of the U.S. election. FreeDum Fighters offers a unique approach by blending cryptocurrency with politics. The token is part of the growing PolitiFi sector, which includes tokens tied to political themes and events. The total market cap of PolitiFi tokens has now reached $670 million, and investor interest is on the rise. FreeDum Fighters has built a solid community of 1,800 Twitter followers and 1,500 Telegram members, showing strong support for its project. The token is priced at $0.000075 in its presale phase, mirroring a democratic election process. Of the total supply, 40% is reserved for presale, while 20% will be used for exchange liquidity. Security has been a top priority for the team, as the token has already passed two independent audits. Also, FreeDum Fighters has an exciting roadmap that includes staking pools and weekly debates with rewards through airdrops. This ensures ongoing community engagement, making the project one to watch as the PolitiFi sector grows. With its strong presale and unique concept, FreeDum Fighters is a potential alternative to more established meme tokens.

Title: Kerry Group agrees fresh dairy joint venture with Kerry Co-op

Time Published: 2024-11-11T20:42:10Z
Full Content:
Kerry Group and its main shareholder, Kerry Co-op, have reached a fresh agreement on a joint venture for the publicly-quoted food giant’s dairy division, according to sources. The deal, set to be unveiled on Tuesday morning, would see the co-op initially take a 70 per cent stake in the venture for about €350 million, putting a €500 million valuation on the business, they said. Kerry co-op is expected to ultimately buy the remainder of the dairy business, called Dairy Ireland, covering milk processing plants in the Republic and the UK, within five years for €150 million. The unit owns brands such as Charleville cheese and Cheestrings snacks. The outline of the accord, which follows the collapse in early 2021 of an original joint venture, was first reported on Monday evening by the Farmers Journal and Agriland publications. Spokesmen for Kerry Group and Kerry Co-op declined to comment when contacted by The Irish Times. Talks between both sides broke down in April 2021 after 18 months of negotiations, after Kerry Group rejected the co-op’s initial bid for a 60 per cent stake in the dairy processing business that would have valued the entire business at €600 million. Kerry Group was said to have placed a valuation expectation on the dairy unit of about €800 million at the time. Kerry co-op owns about 11.3 per cent of the listed company, more than double the 5.1 per cent interest held by the second-largest shareholder, US investment giant Blackrock. Kerry Group, which floated on the stock market in 1986 and is currently led by chief executive Edmond Scanlon, has long left its dairy co-op roots behind to become a global taste and nutrition giant. The taste and nutrition division accounted for 86 per cent of the group’s €8 billion of revenues last year and 96 per cent of its €1.2 billion earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). The development comes three years after Kerry Group sold its UK and Irish consumer foods’ meats and meals business – including brands such as Denny, Galtee and Richmond – to US poultry producer Pilgrim’s Pride for €819 million. The board of the co-op drafted in a veteran of the industry – former Dairygold boss Jim Woulfe – early last year to advise on a strategic review, which ultimately led to a return of both sides to the negotiating table. The latest deal will need the approval of shareholders of both companies. It follows Glanbia initially selling a 60 per cent in its Dairy Ireland segment to Glanbia Co-op in 2017, with the remaining 40 per cent being transferred five years later. Kerry Group reported on October 2rth that its volumes rose in the third quarter as the company remained on track to meet guidance for the year. However, the group noted consumer demand across many food and beverage markets remained relatively muted, a consequence of the inflation experienced in many of its markets. The Dublin-listed group said overall volumes were up 4.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year, with its more significant taste and nutrition unit growing 3.4 per cent. Growth was driven by the Americas, a good performance in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions, with more positive volumes in Europe in the third quarter. The Dairy Ireland business, which had been hit by falling prices in the first six months of the year, saw volume growth of 0.4 per cent in the year to date, with the third quarter recording a 5.7 per cent increase. Pricing was lower over the year to date, down 3.1 per cent, but the third quarter was more positive.

Title: Bitcoin: Trump win hurls crypto coin above $80,000 — Will the rally endure?

Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged without restraint. The President-elect intentionally courted the bitcoin community. But can he make good on his promises? The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was trading near $90,000 (€85,780) on Tuesday, reaching a new high. The record rally began on November 4 after Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the next US president. Jonas Groß, chairman of the Digital Euro Association — an organization that promotes digital payment systems — says Trump has declared himself to be the "crypto president" who will "lead the US to a pioneering role in bitcoin." Such promises have been made so far only by presidents of smaller countries, like [President Nayib Bukele of] El Salvador, Groß told DW. "It's no surprise that the crypto community is celebrating." Though Trump had previously harbored a negative opinion about the cryptocurrency, he suddenly made a U-turn during the 2024 election campaign. At a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, for example, he promised to keep the crypto market largely unregulated and to make energy cheaper for the power-hungry mining of cryptocurrencies. Generating new bitcoins and maintaining the so-called blockchain network on which all transactions are recorded requires significant energy. Co-Pierre Georg, director of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, attributes bitcoin's price surge primarily to "structural factors amplified by the US election." Georg told DW that the approval by US market regulators in January of so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in bitcoin made investing in the coin and other cryptocurrencies much easier. With ETFs, investors can profit from price movements by buying shares without owning bitcoin directly. Georg noted that since regulatory approval, huge amounts of money have flowed into such ETFs, indicating that mainly institutional investors, like the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, are fueling the rally. He said that direct purchases of bitcoin via crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpanda, or Kraken haven't fundamentally changed so much recently. Jonas Groß believes, however, that bitcoin's new all-time high mainly reflects sentiment and trust, similar to other publicly traded assets. While financial fraud dominated the headlines regarding bitcoin in the past, "it just needed a reason to lift spirits and get the machinery running again." Trump's soft regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies has "brought positive sentiment back," he added. Bitcoin's most prominent foe in the US administration is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, a staunch advocate of sweeping cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, Co-Pierre Georg expects Trump to try to reorganize the agency overseeing US financial markets but said the incoming president can't simply replace Gensler without proving specific errors. Georg also sees Trump's win as a victory for the crypto industry lobby. "At the moment, it appears that the industry has bought influence over the government and the new Congress," he said in a reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest man has proven an ardent fan of both cryptocurrencies and Donald Trump, whose campaign he supported with millions of dollars. According to news agency Reuters, the crypto industry spent nearly $120 million on support for Trump and Republican candidates, with a significant portion of the funding dedicated to unseat Senate Banking Committee chairman and crypto critic Sherrod Brown from the Democrats. The campaign of Brown's Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, was reportedly supported with industry donations of about $40 million. While in the past, bitcoin broke records mainly in the wake of major companies accepting it as payment, such as PayPal in 2020, Georg sees "no such reasons" at the moment. "Bitcoin is completely unsuitable for payments, and it's also not reliable as a stable investment. The only real reason to buy bitcoin is speculative." Jonas Groß is less skeptical, seeing some market fundamentals currently favoring the asset. "Bitcoin has established itself as a new asset class. The first pension funds are already investing, and in my view, it's only a matter of time before the first sovereign wealth funds enter the space. And then we're talking about an entirely different scale," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Noting that markets have already "priced in Trump's promises," he warned, however: "If it turns out he doesn't deliver, prices could of course fall again." For Co-Pierre Georg, predicting if the rally will continue under Trump is "like reading tea leaves." With bitcoin, he said, "you should only invest what you're prepared to lose completely." Moreover, he's wondering about the crypto industry and what it says that it "so strongly supports the election of a convicted criminal and political firebrand like Donald Trump, and then massively profits from his win." This article was originally written in German. Editor's note: This article, originally published on November 11, has been updated to reflect bitcoin's continued rally.

Title: Donald Trump Picks Stephen Miller for Deputy Chief of Staff

Time Published: 2024-11-11T19:00:32Z

President Donald Trump has chosen immigration expert Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff, a source close to the president-elect confirmed to Breitbart News. The choice puts Trump’s promise of pro-American immigration reform at the center of his presidency and may help return the nation to a low-migration. high-tech future. Evidence Emerges Trump Is About to Unleash an Economic Boom; Guest John Carney The claim was first posted by CNN on Monday morning. “President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.” If appointed, Miller would work as deputy to Trump’s influential and experienced chief of Staff, Susan Wiles. The appointment would also help repatriation champion Tom Homan in his new job of enforcing Trump’s border and deportation policies on what may be sometimes reluctant agency officials. The appointment is also a signal that Trump’s appointee to run the Department of Homeland Security will face very strong pressure to vigorously enforce Trump’s immigration reform agenda. Trump’s team did not confirm the news report, CNN acknowledged, quoting his spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt: “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.” Miller led Trump’s effort to curb illegal migration during the first term. But his push within the White House bureaucracy was repeatedly countered by establishment and media supporters of large-scale economic migration. In a second Trump administration, Miller will have to manage contradictory pressures on migration. For example, many of Trump’s business and GOP allies want more migration. But the 2024 voters gave him a mandate to reduce the migration that cuts Americans’ wages, drives up housing costs, and reduces investment in productivity-boosting technology. He will also have to balance demands from investors and Fortune 500 business groups who want more white-collar migration via airports, especially amid Trump-promised reductions in blue-collar migration via the southern border. The job would require Miller to oversee policy at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and even the Department of Education. Miller would get little sympathy from pro-migration reporters in the establishment media, most of whom prefer to portray him as a personal enemy of poor migrants. Few media outlets recognize the far-reaching consequences of migration on the nation’s economy. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink continued [emphasis added]: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology… “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2024 Breitbart

Data from CoinShares shows that investors were hungry for crypto products last week—and threw nearly $2 billion at investment funds giving exposure to digital assets. Most of this money was focused on the Bitcoin ETFs that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in January. The funds—run by asset managers such as Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale—allow investors to buy shares that track the price of the biggest virtual coin and trade on stock exchanges. “A combination of a supportive macro environment and seismic shifts in the U.S. political system being the likely reason for such supportive investor sentiment,” a Monday report by CoinShares reads, referring to Trump’s election win last week. It added that across all the funds it tracks—including across Europe and Asia, which give exposure to other major coins and tokens—the total amount of assets under management (AUM) hit a new all-time high mark of $116 billion. Investors also wanted to put money into Ethereum, the second biggest digital coin, the report noted: they pumped $157 million into funds around the world last week, with the new American Ethereum ETFs receiving their biggest inflows since they started trading in July. Bitcoin came close to touching $85,000 per coin Monday morning, according to CoinGecko data, setting a new all-time high price that’s more than $11,000 more than the previous mark broken on Election Day. It’s currently trading at $84,375—a seven-day rise of 23%. The asset has surged since Trump, a crypto supporter who’s promised to help the Bitcoin and digital asset industries, last week scored a shock victory in a tight race for the White House. Trump, who served as President from 2017-2021 and will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, was not just a favorite for the crypto industry but also for Wall Street, with top hedge fund managers betting on his election ahead of last week’s result.

Title: Bitcoin skyrockets to an all-time high of over $84,000 — a euphoric surge in investments from Trump's presidential win

These next four years are going to be optimal for crypto holders. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After months of sitting in consolidation, Bitcoin has broken its record high for the second time this year, rising to over $84,000 at the time of writing. CNBC reports the main driving force behind Bitcoin's resurgence is Donald Trump's electoral win for the presidential seat. Bitcoin broke its previous high ($73,794) on November 6, the day Trump won the election. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a nonstop bull run, charging to its all-time high of nearly $85,000 today. Bitcoin's new high represents a 15% increase over its previous high of $73,000 and a 23% increase from its last major high of $69,000 in 2021. This massive spike is purportedly a result of market euphoria following Trump's presidential win. Trump is a big supporter of cryptocurrency, promising to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. He also purportedly insists that all Bitcoin should be mined in the country. Trump's endorsement of crypto, especially Bitcoin, is encouraging investors to pour more money into the cryptocurrency. Purportedly, net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the two days after the election were combined over $2 billion. ETFs appear to be the leading value-builder for the world's most popular cryptocurrencies. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now more valuable than gold due to the election, making Bitcoin one of the most attractive asset builders moving forward. The good news for PC gamers and graphics card buyers is that Bitcoin's mining difficulty has not gotten any easier. As a result, we shouldn't see another major GPU mining shortage in the foreseeable future. Bitcoin's difficulty now requires dedicated ASICs to be profitable. Ethereum is in the same boat since the crypto moved to a proof-of-stake strategy that makes mining Ethereum with GPUs impossible. Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency that has seen price increases; virtually all of the popular cryptos have seen sudden spikes due to Trump's electoral win. Ethereum is now at $3,300, representing a full $1,000 increase in less than a week. Another popular coin, Ada (Cardano), has increased in value by over 80% in the same timeframe.

Title: The Climate Finance Racket

Time Published: 2024-11-11T16:32:33Z

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 11, 2024 AFP/Getty Images Workers at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, Dubai, 2017 In 2023 the Gulf states supplied around 30 percent of the world’s crude oil imports. They all own sizable National Oil Companies (NOCs); Saudi Aramco is the world’s largest oil firm. And it is not just a matter of oil: they are also ramping up natural gas production. Only the United States exports more liquefied natural gas than Qatar. When it comes to addressing the climate crisis, the Gulf NOCs are fully aligned with the Western giants. They pledge to reduce emissions—by investing in renewables and technologies like carbon capture—while expanding oil and gas production.1 But the Gulf firms have a significant advantage. Where ExxonMobil lobbies governments to pass favorable legislation, the Gulf states directly shape global climate policy. Their influence is especially visible at UN climate talks, such as Conference of the Parties (COP). Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), presided over the last edition. As I noted in these pages, at COP28 Gulf NOCs like Saudi Aramco and ADNOC greenwashed their accelerating hydrocarbon extraction by pledging to also invest more in renewables. More of the same can be expected from COP29, which starts today in Baku, Azerbaijan. Like the UAE, Azerbaijan is wholly dependent on fossil fuels: oil and gas account for some 90 percent of its exports and up to half of its GDP. Mukhtar Babayev, who for more than two decades worked at Azerbaijan’s NOC, will be master of ceremonies. Elnur Soltanov, the deputy energy minister, is the event’s CEO. Last week the campaign group Global Witness, posing as fake oil and gas agents, met with him and filmed him agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at the event. If the focus in Dubai was on reaching an agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels, Baku is being described as the “finance COP.” It is now clearer than ever that poorer countries can neither reduce their carbon emissions nor deal with the impacts of the climate crisis without monetary support. This is where “climate finance” comes in. The term refers to the various channels by which funds are raised for projects, mainly in the Global South, that address these issues. Those funds are needed for a range of activities: building green infrastructure, promoting conservation, investing in renewables, repairing damages, and so forth. They come from diverse sources: government development banks and aid agencies, multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the private sector. Debates around climate finance tend to dwell on the gargantuan sums needed to shift our energy systems towards renewables. At the last COP, for instance, the conference’s conveners estimated that between five and seven trillion dollars will be needed annually “in greening the global economy by 2030.” Earlier this month the UN published a report noting that poorer countries were likely to received ten to eighteen times less funding than they need for climate adaptation. These are indeed alarming figures. A further complication is that funding inevitably comes with strings attached, most often in the form of loans at market rates that put their recipients deeper in debt.2 Governments, multilateral organizations, and private firms are all vying to shape climate finance markets—and their interests do not always align with the planet’s. These contradictions are likely to be laid bare in Baku, where Gulf states in particular are planning to pledge vast sums of money. * The Gulf states see no conflict between expanding hydrocarbon production and simultaneously investing in the green transition. If anything, they view the fight against climate change as a profit-making opportunity. Consider ACWA Power, a Saudi-owned energy firm that operates more than 280 subsidiaries across the world. On the one hand, ACWA is responsible for delivering 70 percent of Saudi Arabia’s planned renewable energy projects. (The country aims for half its energy to come from renewables by 2030.) It is currently building an enormous wind power plant in Azerbaijan that, when completed in 2025, will be that country’s largest renewable energy facility. It is also the official “energy and water partner” of COP29 and in this capacity will shape policy discussions. On the other hand, ACWA is still firmly anchored in oil and gas: in 2023 the company generated more than 90 percent of its electricity from plants fired by fossil fuels. The Gulf’s enthusiastic investment in climate finance is predicated on a similar understanding. Three of the world’s six biggest sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)—that is, state-owned investment funds—are headquartered in the Gulf; collectively they hold more than $3.5 trillion, much of which comes from oil and gas exports. The Gulf states are spending the money alongside their other petrodollar wealth to shape who provides climate finance and who receives it. In short, they are playing all sides of the energy market. This trend was on full display at COP28. During the early days of the conference, the UAE established a new private sector climate fund, Altérra, into which it poured $30 billion—more than a third of the total climate financing raised in Dubai. (The five multilateral climate funds established under the UN Climate Convention collectively raised little over $10 billion.) Altérra now bills itself as the “world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action” and has set a goal of mobilizing a further $250 billion by 2030. It aims to “bring unprecedented scale to address humanity’s most urgent challenge and supercharge the transition to a net-zero climate-resilient future.” Through a complex structure of nested ownership, it is largely controlled by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan—a member of the UAE’s ruling family, the country’s national security advisor, and the president’s brother. The firm is listed in Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone, the Abu Dhabi Global Market, where corporate and income tax are not levied. Advertisement As a private firm, Altérra aims to make above-average returns for its owners and investors. It operates not alone but as a “fund-of-funds,” partnering with asset management and private equity giants, notably BlackRock, Brookfield, and TPG Capital. By placing its capital in funds those firms manage, Altérra profits from their investments in infrastructure and other assets around the world. The portfolio is climate-agnostic—ie even includes fossil fuel stocks and plants in the Global North. Shortly after Altérra placed $650 million in BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Fund IV, it jointly purchased a fossil gas pipeline on the eastern seaboard. This is indeed a perverse kind of “climate change action.” Other Gulf governments and SWFs have invested billions of dollars in renewable and low-carbon technologies while remaining firmly grounded in hydrocarbons. Consider Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has over $900 billion in assets. The fund owns about 8 percent of Saudi Aramco and 44 percent of ACWA Power but it is branching into renewables and other green projects, recently allocating over $19 billion into sustainable investments. PIF is a founding member of the One Planet SWF Network, an initiative established after the Paris Agreement, which aims to channel sovereign wealth into green assets. (Three of the other five founding members are Gulf-based: SWFs in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Qatar.) Likewise, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi’s SWF, Mudabala, produces more than 350,000 barrels of oil a day across eleven countries, even as it finances solar and wind farms in India. Mubadala is also one of three shareholders of Masdar, the Al Jaber–chaired renewable energy firm that runs the world’s largest single-site solar power plant. * Another prominent form of climate finance is carbon offsetting: schemes in which governments, companies, or individuals fund projects that purportedly reduce carbon emissions. Such reductions are repackaged as financial assets known as carbon offsets (measured in tons of CO2), which are then sold to polluters, who use them to cancel out their own emissions. The carbon offset market is booming: Morgan Stanley predicts that, from about $2 billion in 2020, it will be worth $250 billion by 2050. There are various types of offset projects, but the most common one aims at preventing deforestation. This September, for instance, at New York’s Climate Week, the LEAF Coalition—comprising the governments of Norway, the UK, the US, and South Korea, as well as corporations from those countries—pledged funds to protect sections of the Amazon rainforest in Pará, Brazil (incidentally, the country hosting COP30). “The state government will use the proceeds from the LEAF agreement to finance its statewide programs to further reduce deforestation and support…sustainable economic development,” the press release reads. Carbon offsetting is beset with accusations of greenwashing, fraud, and human rights violations. For one thing, indigenous communities in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia—crucial targets of offsetting projects—have been evicted from their forest homelands in the name of preservation. In 2023 the journalists Daisy Dunne and Yanine Quiroz compiled research on over sixty carbon offset projects, finding that 70 percent caused harm to Indigenous people and local communities. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch documented how the Chong Indigenous people were expelled from their lands in southern Cambodia to make way for the Southern Cardamom REDD+ Project. Repeated evictions and displacement have led the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Francisco Calí Tzay, to call for a global moratorium on carbon offset projects. There are also two methodological flaws with carbon credit accounting. One is that any calculation of the emissions saved through projects like forest protection rests upon a shaky counterfactual: how much carbon would have been released if it was not in place? This is obviously impossible to determine with any certainty. A study in Science of offset projects across six countries found that most did not reduce deforestation, and that carbon credits sold were used to “offset almost three times more carbon emissions than their actual contribution to climate change mitigation.” Advertisement The second problem is temporal. When a buyer purchases carbon offsets, they gain the right to pollute in the present. But it takes hundreds of years for a forest to absorb an equivalent amount of carbon, and there is no guarantee that the forest will stand for that long. In California recent wildfires have consumed large forested areas that were ostensibly protected by offsets purchased by companies like Microsoft and BP. Unsurprisingly, the Gulf states are emerging as leading advocates of offsetting. This came to the fore at the African Climate Summit, convened in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2023. Here a group of prominent Emirati energy and financial firms, known as the UAE Carbon Alliance, committed to buying $450 million worth of carbon credits over the next six years from the African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), a coalition of African governments, carbon credit firms, Western donors, and multilateral organizations. The agreement made the UAE the largest financial backer of ACMI. Saudi Arabia is likewise deeply involved in carbon markets. The Saudi businesswoman Riham ElGizy heads the Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company (RVCMC), which was set up in 2022 as a joint venture between PIF and the Saudi stock exchange, Tadawul. (Soltanov, the CEO of COP29, has lauded RVCMC for creating carbon offset markets “at speed and at scale with global impact.”) In 2022 and 2023 RVCMC organized the world’s two biggest carbon credit auctions, at which more than 3.5 million tons worth of carbon credits were sold, 70 percent of them sourced from African offset projects; the principal buyers were Saudi firms, led by Saudi Aramco. Indeed, offsetting is central to Saudi Aramco’s official “sustainability” plan, accounting for around a third of the 52 million metric tons of carbon it pledges to reduce by 2035. In addition to buying carbon offsets, Gulf companies are establishing the projects that generate them. Shortly before the COP28 summit, investigative journalists from SourceMaterial broke the story that Blue Carbon—a company owned by Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai’s ruling family—had signed deals with African governments to lease vast tracts of land, including 10 percent of Liberia, Zambia, and Tanzania, and an astonishing 20 percent of Zimbabwe. Blue Carbon, which has no experience in the industry, will either protect preexisting forests or plant trees in these areas, creating carbon credits to sell to polluters. Axel Michaelowa, a scientist at the University of Zurich, estimates that the carbon credits earned this way would be equivalent to all of the UAE’s annual carbon emissions. In this light, the upcoming negotiations in Baku take on an ominous significance. Member nations at COP29 are expected to agree on a set of international trading standards for carbon credits. This October the Article 6.4 Supervisory Board, the body responsible for developing governance mechanisms for the carbon market under the Paris Agreement, released their proposals, which regulate how carbon credits are established and calculated but accept the system’s basic principles. The Financial Times noted that the rules could allow “oil-producing nations to avoid their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels or make cuts in their industrial emissions.” One fact has not been widely reported: Saudi Arabia currently chairs the Board, represented by Maria AlJishi, who worked for a long time at Saudi Aramco. Climate finance is a programmatically market-led “solution” to the climate crisis in that it is predicated on further commodifying nature. By justifying extraction here by investing in so-called law carbon projects there, prolonging business as usual in the present while making vague promises about the future, it offers a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. To understand where such policies come from, it would be remiss to focus solely on Western oil companies. Major oil producing states in the Global South—like the Gulf monarchies, Azerbaijan, and Brazil—also profit from these projects and agreements, which are in the end disastrous for the planet and its inhabitants. As we watch these states help steer the direction of COP negotiations, we should remember that they are not voices for climate justice but part of the problem.

Title: PDD Holdings (PDD)’s Rapid Rise: How Pinduoduo and Temu Are Shaping E-Commerce

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) stands against other best internet retail stocks to buy now. According to a report published by FTI Consulting, the United States e-commerce is experiencing a revival after a period of stagnation post-COVID. After 18 months of slow growth, e-commerce sales began to pick up again in early 2023 as consumers resumed shopping habits that had been altered during the pandemic. The report notes that e-commerce sales growth represented 46% of total retail sales growth in 2023 and surged to 57% in the first quarter of 2024, marking its highest contribution since 2017, excluding pandemic spikes. Consumers have adopted the trend of shopping online as despite the reopening of physical stores, many consumers continue to prefer online shopping. The report indicates that foot traffic in stores remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, with many Americans choosing to shop online rather than visit physical locations. This shift suggests a long-term change in consumer behavior, as evidenced by ongoing declines in in-store visits and increased e-commerce market share. Talking about the pandemic era from 2020 to 2022 total retail sales in the United States (excluding auto and gas) increased by 31%, compared to only 12.2% from 2017 to 2019. The report suggests this translates to an additional $1.9 trillion in retail spending above pre-COVID norms. This increased spending benefited the e-commerce segment as it was able to capture 87% of the increase in total retail spending during the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Looking forward, the United States’ e-commerce sales are projected to grow at a sustainable rate of high to mid-single digits annually. This is a significant slowdown from the mid-teens growth rates seen before COVID but still sufficient for continued market share gains against traditional retail channels. Moreover, the report also highlighted that newcomers including Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop are entering the US e-commerce market. These newcomers are disrupting the established players through a strategy of becoming low-cost retailers. For instance, Temu achieved $14 billion in global gross merchandise value (GMV) sales in 2023 and is targeting $30 billion for 2024. On the other hand, Shein captured 40% of the fast fashion market domestically and had an estimated global GMV of $42 billion in 2023. Moreover, TikTok Shop was launched in 2023 and is aiming for $50 billion in global e-commerce sales by 2024. The report suggests that while these platforms may attract budget-conscious consumers, they may not significantly threaten established e-commerce giant’s dominance due to perceived differences in product quality and brand positioning. Looking ahead as per FTI Consulting the US online retail sales are expected to hit $1.2 trillion in 2024 translating to a 9.8% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the e-commerce market share is also expected to increase from 21.6% in 2023 to 22.7% by the end of the current year. Moreover, some of the key trends identified by the reports are a sharp increase in the closing of physical retail stores due to increased labor costs, rents, and the feasibility of selling online. In addition to this, another key trend is the use of artificial intelligence among internet retailers, which helps engage with customers more closely and enables a personalized shopping experience. We have also covered the 7 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “E-commerce is growing faster than expected and as new avenues of selling online open up, companies are bound to keep up with trends and innovative strategies. According to a report by Forbes, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $7.9 trillion by 2027 from $6.3 trillion in 2024. In 2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to be made online, up from 20.1% in 2024. To compile the list of 10 best internet retail stocks to buy now we used the Finviz stock screener.

Title: BlackRock Plows $2 Billion Into Momentum Stocks After Election

(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest asset manager is leaning into the stock market’s post-election rally after shying away from risk exposure in the run-up to the vote. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration More than $1.9 billion flooded into the $13 billion iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker MTUM) on Friday, the biggest one-day flow since the fund’s 2013 launch, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At the same time, a record $1 billion exited from the $32.5 billion iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (IUSB). A BlackRock spokesperson confirmed that the firm adjusted its model portfolio allocations last week. The influx of funds into MTUM reflects BlackRock’s conviction that US equities — fresh off their best weekly performance of 2024 — will continue to climb as a “coiled spring” of pent-up business activity unwinds. With election uncertainty resolved, decisions on corporate capital allocations that were formerly on hold will resume. As such, the firm’s model portfolio team, which oversees about $131 billion in assets, is increasing its overweight on stocks from 3% to 4% heading into year-end. “Rather than attempting to thread the needle with tactical sector or industry bets tied to specific electoral outcomes, we’re positioning for a broader relief rally that we believe will transcend partisan results,” Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite wrote in investment commentary dated Nov. 8. “This ‘uncertainty discount’ embedded in market prices should begin to thaw as businesses and investors regain their footing and seek to execute on delayed strategic initiatives.” Model portfolios — which package together funds into ready-made strategies to sell to advisers — have ballooned in size in recent years. Broadridge Financial Solutions estimates that model assets likely reached $5.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and could reach $11 trillion by 2028. As a result, even small adjustments can cause big shifts in ETF flows. In addition to post-vote clarity, Gates wrote that recent economic data — showing that the labor market is cooling while growth remains resilient — should support the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting campaign, adding to the firm’s bullish conviction.

Title: Bitcoin soars past $82,000 as the Trump rally shows no sign of slowing

Bitcoin keeps hitting new record highs as the cryptocurrency rallies on Donald Trump’s presidential election win, which will put a crypto ally in the White House for the first time ever. The leading cryptocurrency surged to $89,560 on Monday evening, just hours after reaching $82,000 earlier that day, extending its impressive 126% gain for the year. According to the crypto tracking website CoinGecko, Bitcoin has surged more than 129,296% since 2013, meaning that a $1000 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1.2 million. And its price is expected to continue barreling forward, as investors’ optimism and enthusiasm grows on Trump’s return to the Oval Office in January. Some analysts say Bitcoin could even cross the $100,000 threshold as a result. Throughout his campaign, Trump took an unprecedented pro-Bitcoin stance, championing the digital currency as a symbol of financial independence and an alternative to traditional banking. Labeling himself as the “crypto candidate,” Trump fully embraced digital assets in his campaign, even accepting donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana. Trump also addressed a Bitcoin event, attending the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, where he emphasized his commitment to positioning America at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Following Trump’s election win last week, investors began pouring cash into spot Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. On Thursday alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK-1.62%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with more than $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs have lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across a number of other digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was priced at more than $3,100 as of Monday morning. Dogecoin surged 18% in the past 24 hours, while Solana was up 6%. The global crypto market is valued at $2.79 trillion — an almost 3% rise in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap.

Title: Swiggy's public debut will test India's appetite for $1B+ IPOs | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Swiggy’s upcoming IPO on Wednesday will finally give many analysts a public comparable for what has been long considered to be the Indian internet stock: Zomato. It will also test the nation’s appetite for IPOs that can scale past the $1 billion mark. For its IPO, Swiggy has already secured $1.4 billion from institutional investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, BlackRock and eight of the top 10 Indian mutual funds. Still, it will enter a public market where large tech companies’ stocks have struggled historically. Three years since its $2.5 billion offering, Paytm is still trading 47% below its IPO price. More than a dozen Indian tech startups have gone public in the last four years, but the market has shown scant interest in large IPOs. Beauty and wellness e-commerce company Nykaa is still trading 53% below its debut price, and Star Health and Allied Insurance Company remains 48% below its IPO price three years on. Startups that raised less than $500 million in India have performed incredibly well in comparison. India has emerged as a hotbed for tech IPOs this year even as the U.S. market remains muted. All eyes are on Swiggy’s IPO at the moment, particularly as many growth-stage startups — and their investors — are eyeing a similarly large listing over the next 24 months. Furthermore, for many Indian startups that were based in the U.S. and Singapore, moving their official HQs back to India would let them better comply with local regulations to do such an IPO. It’s also an opportunity to reap the benefits of a market whose benchmark index had risen more than 10% in the past year. Up to three dozen startups could be shifting their domiciles back to India in the coming years, according to investors. The prospects for Swiggy’s IPO looks good — especially given that rival Zomato’s stock has surged over 100% since its $1.3 billion listing in 2021, reaching a market cap high of $29 billion this year. In comparison, Swiggy is seeking a valuation of $11.3 billion. It helps that the Indian food delivery market has long been a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy. And what makes the offer even more attractive to investors is that Swiggy is among the dozen firms attempting to disrupt the $1.1 trillion Indian retail market that is still dominated by millions of mom-and-pop stores. Swiggy’s Instamart is among the top three quick-commerce businesses in the country, which promises deliveries of groceries, wellness, and beauty products and much more within 10 minutes. Whether these companies will be able to revolutionize the broader retail market in India remains to be seen, but they have already captured 56% of the online grocery delivery market from e-commerce firms, according to JPMorgan. Quick-commerce firms such as Instamart, Zomato-owned Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, and Minutes are changing consumer behavior in urban Indian cities, home to about 80 million people. Together, they are on track to record sales of more than $6 billion this year, according to TechCrunch estimates. “I don’t think Swiggy will just be an e-commerce company in the future, but I do think that given the growth rate of Instamart, and the total addressable market it’s going after, the percentage of e-commerce in Swiggy is going to have a dramatic change,” said Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety (pictured above at the top) in an interview with TechCrunch. Underpinning this business model is a unique supply chain system that involves strategically setting up hundreds of discrete warehouses, or “dark stores,” within kilometers of residential and business areas. This allows the firms to make deliveries within minutes of an order. This approach differs from that of e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, which have fewer but much larger warehouses in areas where rent is cheaper and farther from residential areas. Swiggy operates over 600 such facilities, while Zomato’s Blinkit ended the September quarter with 791 stores. Swiggy, which counts Prosus, SoftBank, Accel, and Elevation among its backers, has scaled Instamart to 30 Indian cities. But many investors and analysts have expressed doubts about the viability of extending the quick-commerce model to smaller Indian cities and towns. “Do we have an operating model for city number 500? Honestly, I don’t know,” said Majety. Asked if the model works on city number 75, Majety said: “I think that probably exists. We will see city 75 having quick commerce.” Swiggy’s IPO will also show how willing investors are to bet on business models that prioritize growth over profits amid challenging global conditions. For Dutch investor Prosus, Swiggy’s listing could deliver a threefold return. It will also be the venture firm’s biggest hit from India, where its $1 billion-plus gains from Byju’s have all but evaporated. Accel is expected to see a more than 35-fold return, one of its largest in the past five years.

Full Content:
November 11, 2024 07:01 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Brain-Computer Interface Market" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Brain-Computer Interface Market was valued at USD 2.3 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 4.5 Billion by 2029, rising at a CAGR of 14.20%. Emerging BCI technologies will provide more intuitive control and a greater range of applications with their enhanced accuracy and user interfaces. BCI technology is expected to feature more effective interpretations of neural data in the near future due to developments in neural signal processing and machine learning (ML). This will enable users to have more fluid control of prosthetic limbs and other devices, such as wearables that move the user's body. These developments may provide the means for individuals with the most severe disabilities to lead more independent lives.In addition, advances in technology have increased the ability to combine two BCI approaches for better results. For instance, the use of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in motor rehabilitation may be safer and more successful in light of recent developments in fNIRS-EEG devices and deep learning algorithms. BCI helps patients with severe disabilities effectively interact with their environment through external devices like text-to-speech converters, computers, neural prostheses and assistive appliances. The ultimate goal of a direct BCI is to help individuals regain their motor ability through rehabilitation training in virtually any setting. Market Dynamics and Growth FactorsThe major drivers of the BCI market include the integration of AI, which is helping researchers enhance BCI product development; the growing prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; and increasing support from government agencies and associations for the development of BCI technology. Advances in AR and virtual reality (VR) technology applications also have the potential to create future opportunities in the global BCI market.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $82,000 boosted by Trump’s re-election win

Bitcoin has hit another record, reaching over $82,000 on Monday, boosted by Donald Trump’s re-election to the White House last week. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s value has risen more than 19% in the past seven days and 30% over the past 30 days. Taking to X, Anthony Pompliano, host of the Pomp podcast, said: “The first pro-Bitcoin President was elected in US history and Bitcoin hit $80,000 within a week. The market is preparing itself.” The first pro-bitcoin President was elected in US history and bitcoin hit $80,000 within a week. The market is preparing itself. — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) November 10, 2024 While Trump’s win has helped push crypto prices up, many don’t think it’s the sole reason. In response, Sleep Money Maker said: “Think bigger than one week or one event. We’re watching decades of regulatory friction starting to dissolve. When barriers fall, capital flows – that’s just market physics in action.” Speaking to CoinJournal last week, James Toledano, COO at Unity, a self-custody crypto wallet, said it was “disingenuous” to say the US election directly caused the price increase. In the long-term, it won’t be the election that moves the crypto market, but “broader macroeconomic events, technological advancements, shifting market sentiment, and factors outside of the next President’s control,” Toldeano explained. Institutional interest in Bitcoin has also reached new levels, noted by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) bringing in a record $1.12 billion in daily inflows. This followed BlackRock setting a new record in October when its total assets reached $30 billion in 293 days. Speaking of the recent price rally, Toledano, said: “There is clearly heightened confidence in Bitcoin as a key investment vehicle and institutional investors are not only recognizing Bitcoin’s resilience as an asset class but are increasingly allocating capital in response to favorable macroeconomic conditions, including recent rate cuts and political shifts.” Other coins that are rallying include Ethereum, trading over $3,100, Solana, at $216, and Dogecoin, up nearly 158% in the past month at $0.2877.

Title: Thomas Clarkson nears Ireland debut as Andy Farrell considers changes for Argentina clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/11/thomas-clarkson-nears-ireland-debut-against-argentina-as-andy-farrell-considers-rotation/
Time Published: 2024-11-11T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Leinster prop Thomas Clarkson could be in line for his Ireland international debut against Argentina next Friday night. Neither Tadhg Furlong or Tom O’Toole have been ruled out of the game but both must be considered doubtful, and although the 24-year-old Clarkson was initially named as one of five uncapped “training panellists”, there is no other tighthead in the squad. Clarkson was also involved in the captain’s run at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday before Friday night’s 23-13 loss against New Zealand, during which O’Toole was helped off within two minutes of coming on as a replacement for Finlay Bealham, who had to return and play until the end of the game. Bealham had started in place of the injured Furlong, who is unlikely to be risked after apparently aggravating the hamstring injury he had initially suffered on Leinster duty during Ireland’s training camp in Portugal. “You’d always hope when you’ve got a world-class tighthead that’s not fit, but we’ll see how that goes,” said Andy Farrell regarding the possibility of Furlong recovering to face Argentina, who continued their eye-catching progress under Felipe Contepomi with a 50-18 win over Italy in Udine on Saturday. “You’ve got to see how people pull up,” added Farrell. “You could see that Finlay had given his all, hadn’t he? He was pretty spent at times. There’s a few people like that so we’ll see how they pull up on Sunday.” Although O’Toole visibly staggered before being assisted off, he does not have to be stood down for a mandatory 12 days if he has no prior history of concussion. Clarkson, who began playing at Wicklow RFC and came through Blackrock College, was an ever-present in Ireland’s 2019 under-20 Grand Slam success and has accumulated 47 caps for Leinster. Allowing for this issue, it is not Farrell’s style to throw the baby out with the bathwater, not least in the wake of Ireland’s first home defeat in 3½ years. Farrell retained an unchanged team after last season’s Six Nations defeat in Twickenham as Ireland sealed back-to-back titles a week later against Scotland, albeit the head coach rejigged things when demoting Bundee Aki and Peter O’Mahony for the second Test victory in Durban last July. That victory was secured by two drop goals from Ciarán Frawley, albeit the Skerries man suffered an altogether contrasting experience last Friday night. Farrell opted to bring him on in the 58th minute for Jack Crowley despite Ireland leading at the time “just to freshen it up, give Frawls a chance”, said the Irish coach afterwards. “Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn’t.” But Farrell did intimate that he has a degree of rotation in mind over the month, with Argentina to be followed by Fiji, who had a historic 24-19 win over Wales in Cardiff on Sunday, as well as a fourth match against Joe Schmidt’s Australia, who have been buoyed by Saturday’s dramatic 42-37 win over England. “It’s a tough old month, four games back to back on the trot,” said Farrell. “So, we’ll see what the energy levels are like.” Frawley will come under consideration for his first Test start at outhalf after a contest that called into question Ireland’s game management as they adjust to life after the generational player that was Johnny Sexton. “Game-management is not just down to them, it’s down to others helping with the calls and seeing the space,” said Farrell of his inexperienced outhalves. “But, having said that, if you are playing you would expect yourself to hold on to the ball for more than a couple of phases, which we didn’t do at times.” Robbie Henshaw will come under consideration, as will Jamie Osborne, who won his third cap as a 70th-minute replacement for Garry Ringrose last Friday after performing admirably when starting both Tests in South Africa at fullback. Farrell might also look at Ireland’s starting back five in the pack and replacements in that sector, with a plethora of younger players such as Ryan Baird, Cormac Izuchukwu, Nick Timoney and Cian Prendergast itching to inject some fresh energy. Ireland’s defeat has removed them from the top of the world rankings to be published at noon on Monday, as New Zealand overtook them. What’s more, the Springboks’ 32-15 win over Scotland at Murrayfield saw them reclaim the number one spot, meaning Ireland will drop to third.

Title: Ticker: Bitcoin soars on Trump election

Bitcoin rallied past $80,000 for the first time on Sunday, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.Trump was declared the winner in Arizona, marking a clean sweep of the seven US battleground states. His decisive victory in the US presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the crypto industry, which spent more than $100 million backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates in the US election.“With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros.The largest crypto token climbed as much as 4.7% to an unprecedented $80,092 before falling back to around $79,700 as of mid-morning in New York.Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets.Bitcoin has added about 91% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold.The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Ken Fisher’s AI Powerhouse with Unmatched Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. Our Methodology This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s positive outlook is bolstered by its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, where its GPUs are crucial for powering advanced applications, positioning NVIDIA to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI solutions across industries. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center segment is also experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the rise in AI and cloud computing as organizations migrate to these services, placing NVIDIA to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a strong financial foundation, NVIDIA continues to invest heavily in research and development, ensuring it remains at the forefront of innovation. Its robust cash flow further enables strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive accelerated growth. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surpassed estimates, reporting a normalized EPS of $0.68, beating projections by $0.04, with revenue of $30.04 billion, exceeding forecasts by $1.29 billion. As NVIDIA approaches its Q4 earnings report on November 20, 2024, analysts project a normalized EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $32.94 billion. Over the last 90 days, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received 32 upward EPS revisions, reflecting strong investor confidence in its sustained momentum and leadership within the semiconductor industry. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Massive Day For BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF As Trading Volume Reaches Unseen Levels With $4.1 Billion Traded

On Nov. 6, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) achieved an unprecedented trading milestone, with volume spiking to $4.1 billion in a single day – its highest ever. This surge, following Donald Trump's reelection as President of the United States, signals a potent wave of institutional and potentially retail interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. Don't Miss: Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X (formerly Twitter) that this massive trading volume exceeded that of established stocks like Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix and Visa, making it an extraordinary day for Bitcoin on the ETF front. To add perspective, many Bitcoin ETFs also saw a significant uptick, trading at nearly twice their typical volume. This is reminiscent of Bitcoin ETFs’ highly volatile early days in January. Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to a mix of factors, including Bitcoin's price momentum, which saw the asset climb to a record high of $76,500. However, based on TradingView data shortly after, the asset's price dipped slightly to $75,267. Nevertheless, it remains one of the dominant assets in 2024's ETF outlook. Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ — this platform touts returns as high as 12.5% APY and is giving $100 in welcome rewards if you sign up today. As ETF Store president Nate Geraci highlighted in an X post, Bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful launches this year. Additionally, Trump's return to office has sparked optimism in the crypto space, with many pointing to his pro-crypto stance and anticipated policy support as potential catalysts for Bitcoin's continued growth. As Bitcoin ETFs break new ground, the broader landscape has seen asset managers scramble to file for a range of altcoin-focused ETFs, including those for Solana, XRP and Litecoin. They've also proposed several crypto index ETFs, allowing investors to hold diversified digital assets. Balchunas previously described these filings as "call options on a Trump victory," indicating that fund managers may be banking on a favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. Should pro-crypto policies become a reality, experts believe the market may see even more significant inflows and innovations in the ETF space. See Also: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed! However, it's not all rosy for Bitcoin purists. Some argue that the rising influence of financial giants like BlackRock could undermine Bitcoin's foundational decentralization ethos. The concern is that as these firms accumulate substantial Bitcoin holdings, they could inadvertently centralize control, threatening the independence that originally attracted many to cryptocurrency. An anonymous crypto analyst noted that while ETFs add stability to Bitcoin's market presence, they may also consolidate assets in traditional institutions' hands, potentially conflicting with the decentralized ideals that underpin the crypto space. The political climate is also adding complexity. A recent CryptoSlate report suggested that shifts in U.S. policy, especially following Trump's election, could significantly sway crypto ETF inflows. Furthermore, changes in the U.S. administration can send ripples through the market, potentially creating both opportunities and volatility. With Trump's pro-crypto stance, some analysts, like Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper.co, predict that Bitcoin's price could reach $100,000 by his inauguration on January 20.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Total Number of Shares Owned: 27,267,737 Total Value of Shares Owned: $12,187,315,624 Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 Topping our list of the 10 best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology leader, renowned for its software, cloud services, and artificial intelligence innovations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) maintains a bullish outlook, fueled by strategic focus on high-growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and sustainability. The Azure platform continues to lead the cloud market, while Microsoft’s integration of AI tools, notably Copilot in collaboration with OpenAI, reinforces its position as a frontrunner in AI-powered solutions. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s AI advancements are embedded across its product suite, supporting long-term growth as businesses increasingly adopt AI to enhance productivity. Additionally, Microsoft’s sustainability initiatives, including a partnership with Constellation Energy to power data centers with carbon-free energy, align with its goal of achieving net-zero emissions, enhancing both operational efficiency and its environmental reputation. In Q3 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) exceeded expectations with a normalized EPS of $3.30, beating estimates by $0.20, and reported revenue of $65.59 billion, surpassing forecasts by $1.03 billion. As the next earnings report approaches on January 23, 2025, analysts anticipate a normalized EPS of $3.14 and revenue of $68.98 billion. With 24 upward EPS revisions in the past 90 days, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) demonstrates strong momentum and sustained investor confidence in its growth potential. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AIL round-up: St Mary’s shine on return to Division 1A with spiky win over rivals Terenure

For St Mary’s, it was almost worth the wait or must have felt like it anyway. Caelan Doris, Dan Sheehan and Peter O’Mahony were among a boisterous and engaged crowd of about 3,500 – the biggest at Templeville Road in many years – as the home side confirmed they are back in Division 1A after a seven-year absence with a vengeance courtesy of an eventful and spiky 32-22 over local rivals Terenure on Saturday. Terenure looked well placed after recovering from a blistering start by the home side to lead 15-10 at half-time through well-worked tries by lively hooker Max Russell and classy full-back Adam La Grue. But Mary’s again stormed out of the blocks and the game pivoted on two quickfire tries by centre Myles Carey, albeit the second clearly followed a knock forward in the air from Conor Dean’s up-and-under which somehow all three officials missed. Soon after Jordan Coghlan was held up over the Mary’s line, the influential Greg Jones stole a close-range line-out and Terenure out-half Caspar Gabriel kicked a penalty to the corner dead. But there was no disputing the merits of the Mary’s win and a second try by winger Michael Silvester further rewarded their ploy of attacking ‘Nure on the edges. Whereas Terenure left pointless for the first time this season, a fifth attacking bonus point helped elevate Mary’s into second above Clontarf on points’ difference after the latter’s hard-earned 26-20 win at home to Young Munster. Ballynahinch, including Jake Flannery, Aaron Sexton and Zac Ward, underlined their title credentials when Conor Rankin’s late penalty completed a 27-25 bonus point win away to an injury-hit Lansdowne. The champions Con trailed City of Armagh by 19-7 before converted tries through Daniel Hurley, Scott Buckley and Ronán O’Sullivan in a 28-26 win, but Niall Carville burrowed over late on to earn the home side two bonus points. UCD moved above Garryowen at the foot of the table with a vital 29-19 win at Dooradoyle despite a hat-trick by home captain Donnacha Byrne. The 1B leaders Old Belvedere scored eight tries in a 57-21 win at home Highfield, while Nenagh Ormond stayed second with a 22-14 win over Queen’s as UCC and Naas lost ground. Corinthians’ young guns moved clear in 2A with a 31-14 win at Barnhall, their fifth of six wins with a bonus point, as Cashel lost at home to Navan and Instonians went second with a 35-17 at home to Old Crescent.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/10/2024 10:57:49 AM PST by dynachrome History-making ski resort Ukraine’s gas station network OKKO Group says it’s planning to invest $1.5 billion in a new ski resort in western Ukraine in what could potentially be the country’s largest investment in history. OKKO Group has said it started construction of the Goro Mountain Resort near Slavske — the company is putting $500 million into the resort and plans to attract an additional $1 bn from external investors. The resort is set to open for skiing in the winter of 2026–2027, with plans for full completion by 2039, and is envisioned as a premium destination to rival Bukovel, Ukraine’s leading ski resort. The project was first announced eight years ago but was delayed. The resort will span 75 kilometers of ski slopes. The construction is supported by a partnership with the Ukrainian government through its "investment nanny" initiative that provides expedited land allocation and tax exemptions to enhance the project’s viability.

Title: Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alpha-metallurgical-resources-inc-amr-182955086.html
Time Published: 2024-11-10T18:29:55Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR) on The Chop Wood, Carry Water Newsletter’s Substack by Alexandru Dragut. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMR. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR)'s share was trading at $239.02 as of Nov 7th. AMR’s trailing P/E was 8.76, according to Yahoo Finance. Copyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock Photo Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) presents a compelling investment case within the metallurgical coal industry, a sector vital for steel production. With extensive reserves in Appalachia, AMR supplies premium coal to global markets, maintaining strong partnerships with steelmakers that enhance its resilience through industry cycles. In Q3 2024, AMR reported a substantial 42% increase in liquidity from the previous quarter, reaching $150.3 million in cash reserves. This liquidity enables the company to weather periods of low coal demand and price volatility without heavily relying on debt, safeguarding shareholder value while providing flexibility for reinvestment and growth. AMR’s global reach further strengthens its position, enabling it to meet increasing demand from emerging and developed markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, where steel demand is growing. Operational efficiency has been a cornerstone of AMR’s strategy, with rigorous cost controls that help maintain profitability even amid recent declines in coal prices. This focus on cost management has allowed AMR to sustain its profit margins, highlighting its adaptability to both favorable and challenging market conditions. Financially, AMR’s recent performance underscores its resilience. The company reported trailing 12-month revenue of $3.3 billion, a slight decline from last year due to lower coal demand driven by the shift towards renewable energy. AMR’s profit margin has decreased from 20% to 11%, reflecting the impact of falling coal prices on its bottom line. Despite this, AMR remains profitable, benefiting from its efficient cost structure. Its strong free cash flow margin of 15% further demonstrates effective capital management, reinforcing the company’s financial stability and operational efficiency. From a valuation perspective, AMR’s low trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.88 signals a potential undervaluation, especially for investors focused on earnings potential and cash generation. This low P/E suggests the market may not fully recognize AMR’s cash-generating capabilities, making it an attractive opportunity for value investors. Additionally, AMR’s minimal debt load strengthens its financial flexibility, reducing risk while allowing it to navigate economic uncertainties with confidence. The company’s strategic use of free cash flow, combined with its strong liquidity position, positions it to explore growth opportunities or sustain steady operations during downturns. Looking ahead, AMR is well-placed to benefit from the anticipated increase in global steel demand, driven by infrastructure projects and economic growth in emerging markets. As a low-cost producer with high-quality reserves, the company stands to capture this growth. However, investors should remain mindful of the cyclical risks and regulatory challenges inherent to the coal industry, including potential regulatory costs as the world pivots towards renewable energy. Despite these challenges, AMR’s disciplined financial strategy, robust liquidity, and strong market positioning offer a favorable risk/reward balance, aligning well with value-driven investment principles and providing a solid foundation for long-term growth potential. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 24 hedge fund portfolios held AMR at the end of the second quarter which was 26 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House. McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment. McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.” On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close. Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions. He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta. As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments. To come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks third on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. There is no doubt about NVIDIA’s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, On October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures. These blueprints will help the company’s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to release earnings towards the end of this month, on November 20, 2024. In light of its awaited earning release, on October 19, Vivek Arya analyst at Bank of America, joined CNBC to defend his bullish call on NVDA. Having called the stock a “generational opportunity,” Arya emphasizes that NVDA is trading less than one times its earnings growth, much lower than other names in the magnificent seven. He suggests that NVDA celebrates a large ecosystem encompassing “end-to-end” knowledge, placing it ahead of competitors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to our Insider Monkey database. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Baird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “After Micron Technology, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MU) price appreciated 54% in 1H24, investors became anxious about potential memory weakness, less clear cyclical recovery pace, and whether competitor Samsung will act rationally with capacity expansion.

Title: Bond market on risky path as traders regroup from turbulent week

Time Published: 2024-11-10T15:01:56Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The bond-market selloff unleashed by Donald Trump’s presidential victory last week ended almost as quickly as it began. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Yet firms like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and TCW Group Inc. have issued a steady drumbeat of warnings that the bumpy ride is likely far from over. Trump’s coming return to the White House has significantly upended the outlook for the US Treasury market, where October’s losses had already wiped out much of this year’s gains. Less than two months after the Federal Reserve started pulling interest rates back from a more than two-decade high, the likelihood that Trump will cut taxes and throw up large tariffs is threatening to rekindle inflation by raising import costs and pouring stimulus on an already strong economy. His fiscal plans — unless offset by massive spending cuts — would also send the federal budget deficit surging. And that, in turn, has renewed doubts about whether bondholders will start demanding higher yields in return for absorbing an ever-rising supply of new Treasuries. One scenario is “the bond market instills fiscal discipline with an unpleasant rise in rates,” said Janet Rilling, senior portfolio manager and the head of the Plus Fixed Income team at Allspring Global Investments. She predicted the 10-year Treasury yield could rise back to the peak of 5% hit in late 2023, about 70 basis points above where it was Friday. That “was the cycle high and it’s a reasonable level if there is a full implementation of the proposed tariffs.” There remains considerable uncertainty about the precise policies Trump will enact, and some of the potential impact has already been priced in, since speculators started betting on his victory well ahead of the vote. While 10- and 30-year Treasury yields surged Wednesday to the highest in months, they came tumbling back down again over the next two days, ending the week lower than they began. A Bloomberg index of Treasury returns was up just 1.4% as of Friday’s close. There’s no cash Treasuries trading on Monday due to a US holiday. But the prospect that Trump’s policies will spur growth has driven traders to pare back expectations for how deeply the the Fed will cut rates next year, dashing hopes that bonds would rally as it eased policy aggressively. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and JPMorgan have shifted their Fed forecasts to show fewer reductions. Swaps traders are pricing in that policymakers will reduce its benchmark rate to 4% by mid-2025, a full percentage point higher than they were predicting in September. It’s in a range of 4.5% to 4.75% now. The coming week’s economic data, particularly the latest reading on consumer and producer prices, may spark renewed volatility. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, New York Fed president John Williams and Fed Governor Christopher Waller are also set to speak, providing potentially fresh insights on their outlooks. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said Sunday the US economy has remained remarkably strong as the central bank progressed in beating back inflation, though the Fed was still “not all the way home.” What Bloomberg Strategists Say ... “Election trades are set for a bit of a breather as punters looks to recalibrate risk and sweep a bit of profit off the table. This is kind of what we saw in the aftermath of the election in 2016; after a big rally the day after, the S&P moved sideways for a few days before taking off again. The rise in Treasury yields was more consistent and pronounced, but then again the Fed was on the verge of re-starting its rate-hike normalization, not in the midst of an easing cycle.” Cameron Crise, macro strategist For the full report, click here Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, has been telling investors they shouldn’t expect bond prices to rise from here. He said the recent backup is a chance to lock in elevated yields on short-term bonds, but he remains cautious about longer-term debt given the current uncertainty. After the Fed meeting Thursday, he said in a note to clients that the previous day’s selloff had made short-term yields “extremely attractive.” But “venturing out to the wild blue yonder of longer-term interest rates,” he added, is “maybe not worth that excitement (or the volatility).” Others see risk the bond market has further room to fall. JPMorgan’s Bob Michele, the chief investment officer and head of global fixed income at its asset management arm, is among those warning that 10-year Treasury yields may eventually climb back to 5% after Trump takes office. At Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest asset manager, CIO Vincent Mortier has flagged that point too, saying it’s a “real alert level” that could ripple into the equity market by driving investors to shift cash over to bonds. After the Fed cut rates for its second straight meeting on Thursday, Powell declined to speculate on how Trump’s plans may affect the bank’s path and said it wasn’t clear that the recent rise in yields will hold. But analysts widely expect the next Trump administration to worsen the federal deficit, which has already swelled under President Joe Biden. The Committee for a Responsible Budget last month estimated Trump’s plans would increase the debt by $7.75 trillion more than what’s currently projected through fiscal year 2035. “At some point, an increasing deficit and debt servicing, all things equal, should lead to a higher yield premium,” said Ruben Hovhannisyan, fixed-income portfolio manager at TCW Group. “The question is the degree of how much more fiscal deficits will grow under this administration.” What to Watch Economic data: Nov. 12: NFIB small business optimism; Fed’s senior loan officer survey Nov. 13: MBA mortgage applications; real average earnings; Consumer Price Index; monthly budget statement Nov. 14: Producer price index; jobless claims Nov. 15: Empire manufacturing; retail sales; import and export price index; industrial production; capacity utilization; business inventories Fed calendar: Nov. 12: Fed Governor Christopher Waller; Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin; Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker Nov. 13: Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem; Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid Nov. 14: Barkin; Fed chair Powell; New York Fed President John Williams Auction calendar: Nov. 12: 13-, 26-week bills; 42-day CMB Nov. 13: 17-week bills Nov. 14: 4-, 8-week bills --With assistance from Julien Ponthus and Ruth Carson.

Bitcoin rallied past $80,000 (€74,621) for the first time, boosted by US president-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.7 per cent to an unprecedented $80,092 on Sunday. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected – his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Bitcoin has added about 91 per cent so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak – all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto. Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favourable toward their interests. “Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. – Bloomberg Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Missed The Memo On These Bond Yields Up To 13%

Abstract creative stats data concept with hands typing on laptop on background. Multiexposure It’s a party on Wall Street! While the suits fawn over the hot “Trump trade” stocks, we dividend investors are going to dumpster dive. Hey, we have no shame. We’re talking about yields from 7.8% to 13.4%, paid monthly! Why the bargains? Bonds have been bloodied since the Federal Reserve cut rates. Wait, what? Let’s remember the Fed guides short-term rates. Long-term rates , on the other hand, march to the beat of their own drum: Rates Rebound We could dip into bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—they’ll have the same tailwind at their back. But I prefer CEFs over bland ETFs for three very simple reasons: Note the emphasis on “some.” Once it was clear a bull run in bonds was a certainty, some CEFs’ discounts vanished and haven’t returned. But fortunately for us, other CEFs are still trading for less than they’re worth—while delivering an average of 10% in monthly income, no less. Legit bargains, or cheap for a reason? Let’s explore. We’ll begin with an oddball that goes a little against the grain of our theme: the PGIM Short Duration High Yield Bond Fund (SDHY). This offering from PGIM—which is part of Prudential Investment Management—plays on the short end of the yield curve. Specifically, SDHY’s managers try to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration of three years tops, and a weighted average maturity of no more than five years. SDHY has decent-enough credit quality for a corporate junk fund, with 47% in BB-rated bonds, and another 26% in Bs. Interestingly enough, more than 10% of the portfolio is in investment-grade corporates. If this was a plain-vanilla short-duration ETF, even on the junkier side, we could expect fairly low volatility. Not so here. That’s because SDHY utilizes a fair amount of debt leverage, at more than 20% currently. That means an awfully bumpy ride during downturns, as investors found out throughout 2022. But, near the end of the year, I pointed out that SDHY “has significant potential once the Fed starts slowing its hike pace (and especially once it actually throttles back rates).” And it did! This PGIM fund trades at a smaller discount now (6%) than it did then (10%), but we’re still buying its bonds cheaper than we could on the open market, and we’re getting a nearly 8% yield, paid monthly, to boot. But unlike these other funds, SDHY needs the Fed to keep its thumb pressed down on the interest rates we can see—if there are signs the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle will take a prolonged pause, this CEF’s juice could quickly run dry. Western Asset High Income Fund II (HIX) is ostensibly a high-yield corporate fund, but it’s a little more complicated than that. For one, it’s global; however, the U.S. makes up roughly 60% of the portfolio, while all other countries are 5% or less of assets. HIX has five double-digit sectors—four of them are actual corporate market sectors (consumer cyclical, communications, energy, and finance), and the fifth is emerging-market government bonds. From a maturity perspective, it’s a mid-range fund—not as short-duration-focused as SDHY, but much of its allocation is bunched in the 5- to 10-year range. And not only does HIX utilize a heavy 30% in debt leverage, but it also puts options and derivatives to use, which is how it manages to squeeze a jaw-dropping 13% out of its otherwise ho-hum portfolio. Unfortunately, for all of its fits and starts, it can’t even pull away from basic junk funds over time, and it trails its benchmark over every meaningful time period. I don’t love turning away from a double-digit yield, but that much income has only brought HIX to par. To make matters worse, HIX has the smallest discount of all four funds here, at less than 3% currently. The last time I looked at Allspring Income Opportunities Fund (EAD), back in 2020, it traded as the Wells Fargo Income Opportunities Fund. But a year later, GTCR and Reverence Capital Partners bought up Wells Fargo Asset Management, and renamed the resultant new company Allspring Global Investments. New moniker, but the fund still has the same thrust. EAD invests in junk of all sorts—not just high-yield bonds, but also below-investment-grade loans and preferred stocks. It’s technically a global fund, but nearly 90% of the portfolio is U.S.-based; the rest is a sprinkling of mostly developed foreign markets including Canada, Germany and France. Allspring’s CEF is even more aggressive with leverage, at around 30%. That’s why, like with HIX, we’ll see wild swings compared to bare-bones junk ETFs. But over time, EAD finds itself farther and farther ahead despite deep pullbacks when the bond markets go cold. EAD will probably benefit from a tamping down of long-term rates. But I do wonder about its price right now. Its current 7% discount to NAV is only a little slimmer than its five-year average discount of 8%. But historically, we could do a lot better waiting for a wider discount. The BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ) is a multisector bond fund that’s happy to dabble in just about everything. It’s heaviest in traditional fixed income–roughly 65% of the fund is allocated to investment-grade bonds (35%) and junk (29%). But it also has significant exposure to non-U.S. developed-market sovereigns and securitized products, and a smattering of bank loans and emerging-market debt. We’re also getting solid credit quality, with a roughly 60/40 split of investment-grade to junk. And BTZ is in our sweet spot on the yield curve, with a weighted average life to maturity of nearly 22 years. One reason I like looking at BTZ is it exemplifies how CEFs benefit from active management and having more tools to work with. Managers can hunt down value-priced bonds rather than just plugging in whatever an index tells them to, and they’re also able to scour the credit world for other appealing instruments at times when bonds aren’t the top play. They can also push the pedal down on leverage—BTZ is using a high 35% right now. That’s why we’ll get volatility like this, but also outperformance compared to other actively managed ETFs in the multibond space. A wild 9%-plus yield, paid monthly, further pads the case.

Title: Time to embrace ‘re-sign’ from resign

Use headhunters, advertise on social media, post it on job portals, or launch an attractive employee referral programme? How about your alumni pool? Have you observed your colleagues nostalgically reminiscing about the past when they bump into ex-colleagues? Many enterprises are taking advantage of these relationships. The recent news of Cognizant rehiring 13,000 ex-employees is a clever employer branding move. A rehiring ratio of 3-5 per cent is common in large IT services companies, given that most have lost close to 50,000 employees a year over the last four years due to attrition. But by broadcasting these rehiring numbers, Cognizant sure got the attention of its alumni. With 12-20 per cent attrition in most enterprises today, alumni are a significant proportion of trained talent in the market, working for competitors or otherwise. But is rehiring your former colleagues that easy? “I want to start the next new employee induction session with ‘How to Quit’,” said one of my CHRO — chief human resources officer — friends at a party. He was frustrated by how people were quitting in bizarre ways. He said some of his colleagues texted their resignations, they were unwilling to serve notice periods, switched off during notice periods, and even ghosted after handing in their letter. Corporates look to tread the India Way RNT: Judging a leader’s true nature Flat organisation believers: Can you imagine a world without managers? Rehiring, hence, is an emotionally charged affair in many cases, as former employees have indulged in practices that their ex-managers may deem unacceptable. Even if you want to hire them in other teams, the ex-manager’s emotions can come into play. In cases where the ex-manager seeks to rehire, someone else in the team or HR will pose obstacles like “Can they come at the old salary? We have their peers who stayed back, and we don’t want to set an example that one can quit and come back at a higher salary”. Ironically, we will be okay hiring a rank stranger at a higher salary, and further risk the recruiting experiment, over cultural- and skill-fit alumni. Once I was anchoring a leadership meeting discussing the boomerang hiring of about 10 ex-employees. The meeting turned into a war zone, with the tirade ranging from why we shouldn’t rehire anyone, to why we hire alumni without their ex-managers’ consent, and why we shouldn’t glorify employees’ return at the cost of stayers. According to attrition data in annual reports, the top eight Indian IT service bellwethers have had a staggering 17.15 lakh exits over the last five years. During this period, their collective headcount grew from 14.75 lakh to 19.85 lakh, an addition of 5 lakh employees. The top 10 Indian private banks had 2.8 lakh exits over the last five years. In that period, their collective net headcount increased from 4 lakh to 7.6 lakh, a growth of 3.6 lakh employees. The coveted FAANMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Google) cluster in India saw ⁠over 1 lakh exits in the last five years, and its combined headcount grew from 1 lakh to 1.8 lakh. With such high exits and an aggressive scale of replacement hiring, the alumni pool is a rich source of trained talent. Alumni hiring is not a new trend, however it has lacked the teeth it needed as most enterprises preferred unknown angels over known devils. A Harvard Business Review report quoted a study by human resources management services company UKG, which examined 3 million employee records from 2019 to 2022 and found that 28 per cent of “new hires” were boomerang hires who had resigned within the last 36 months. Another survey by HR consulting firm Robert Half in May 2024 found 48 per cent of people would consider returning to a previous company — up 8 per cent from 2023. The annual study of corporate alumni programmes by the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business shows a boomerang hiring of 8 per cent among the companies surveyed. The study says 98 per cent of the organisations surveyed had at least one full-time equivalent (FTE) employee managing the alumni programme in 2024, 49 per cent had a team of two or more, and 60 per cent had an annual budget of at least $100,000. How many FTEs or dollars are allocated in your organisation for alumni programmes? Did you know that EA, the Enterprise Alumni platform, rates the top ten enterprise alumni networks based on rehiring percentage, number of new business opportunities generated, and mentorship and collaborative programmes or learning opportunities offered? It also rates how engaged the alumni community is. The last published list ranked Blackrock, PwC, McKinsey, EY, Marks and Spencer, and LinkedIn among the top ten. Back home, we know the Flipkart alumni have taken it to newer heights. There have been 44 startups from Flipkart alumni, and six of these have turned into unicorns with a combined valuation of $25 billion. Eight of them are backed by Flipkart founder Binny Bansal. As much as enterprises need a strategy to engage with their alumni, employees need to upskill on ‘when and how’ to resign! After all, we know it takes two to tango!

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink was among headliners at Saudi Arabia’s annual Davos-style investment confab in October. Days later, he popped up on a social media post from Abu Dhabi’s $1.5 trillion man, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The $11.5 trillion asset manager Fink runs recently received approval to set up its regional headquarters in Riyadh. It’s also teaming up with the Abu Dhabi royal on one of the largest efforts to date to bankroll the build-out of data warehouses and energy infrastructure. The biggest firms on Wall Street operate across geographies and top executives often fly to multiple countries while visiting a region. But Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which are competing to be the Middle East’s main business hub, offer unique opportunities: The cities control over $1 trillion in sovereign wealth each, making them among the biggest pools of capital in the world. Sheikh Tahnoon — one of Abu Dhabi’s two deputy rulers, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and brother to its president — had conversations with many executives who also spoke at the FII, according to posts on the royal’s X profile. That list included Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick, Blackstone Inc.’s Steve Schwarzman and Ruth Porat of Alphabet Inc., which is partnering with Saudi Arabia on an artificial intelligence hub. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon also dropped by in Abu Dhabi shortly after his firm announced its new Riyadh office, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two cities have rolled out a series of initiatives in their quest for greater global relevance. Riyadh is asking international firms to boost their local presence, or risk losing business. That’s prompted the likes of General Atlantic and Goldman to beef up their operations in the kingdom. Some others have been reluctant about making Riyadh their main hub because their employees prefer the lifestyle in the UAE. To further sweeten the deal, Abu Dhabi has also rolled out a series of perks, including a lifestyle-support program for incoming financiers. But many firms looking to raise cash or plug into dealmaking driven by ambitious diversification programs are trying to keep a foot in both camps. BlackRock, for instance, said its new Riyadh base will help the firm expand operations across the Middle East and not just in the kingdom. Goldman continues to have a significant presence in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and Barclays Plc, which is considering re-entering Saudi Arabia after a decade, said it intends to grow its team in the UAE as well. Meanwhile, investment bank Lazard Inc., which held sale talks with Abu Dhabi fund ADQ last year, is making a big push in Saudi Arabia, Bloomberg News has reported. While both cities have embarked on similar drives to lure the world’s biggest firms, the past couple of years have also brought into sharp relief shifting priorities for officials in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, and the kinds of partnerships they’re seeking. For instance, Saudi Arabia, with its large and relatively young population, is prioritizing projects aimed at developing its infrastructure, which significantly lags the UAE. But with finances constrained as a result of weak oil prices, it needs to bring in more foreign capital - hence the desire to get the world’s biggest infrastructure fund managers into the country. Case in point: Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.’s new $2 billion Middle East vehicle. “People used to come to us and ask for money,” Yasir Al Rumayyan, the governor of the kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, said on a panel at the FII last month. “We are now seeing a shift from people wanting to take our money to people wanting to co-invest.” Saudi Arabia is also becoming a regional opportunity for investment banks. The kingdom is in the midst of a vast privatization program to raise cash to fund investment plans, and that’s transformed Riyadh into a hotspot for initial public offerings. For Abu Dhabi, with energy riches outweighing the ability of the local economy to digest and which already boasts some of the best infrastructure in the region, the focus is using those assets to prepare for the post-oil economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the emirate’s $1 trillion wealth fund continues to invest predominantly outside the country. At the same time, the city has drawn some of the world’s biggest hedge funds. That’s prompted officials to start expanding the financial hub’s jurisdiction to a neighboring island, in a move that will give it 10 times as much space. Months after billionaire Alan Howard said Abu Dhabi could become a global financial center, Bloomberg News reported the hedge fund he set up manages more money from the emirate than anywhere else. Get the Mideast Money newsletter, a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region. But here too, there’s a balancing act. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, the face of Abu Dhabi’s push to draw hedge fund luminaries, was in Riyadh for FII. He was spotted in traditional Arab garb ahead of the event and later, on a panel, explained the reasons behind his ties to the region. The billionaire was effusive in his praise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “I think his Royal Highness is a great leader,” he said. “He’s almost like a Deng Xiaoping of China, in a sense, or a Lee Kuan Yew (of Singapore).” --With assistance from Silla Brush, Mark Bergen, Laura Gardner Cuesta, Ben Scent and Siddharth Philip.

SINGAPORE – Bitcoin rallied past US$81,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. Trump was declared the winner in Arizona in recent polls, marking a clean sweep of the seven US battleground states. His decisive victory in the presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the digital asset industry, which spent more than US$100 million (S$132.7 million) backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates. The token climbed as much as 6.1 per cent on Nov 10. It hit an unprecedented US$81,497 early in Asia trading on Nov 11 and was changing hands at US$81,244 as at 4.48pm in Singapore. Bullish sentiment lifted smaller coins too, including a surge in Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred, given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Mr Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. Jubilant traders, for the moment, are paying little heed to questions such as the speed of likely implementation or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic possibility. His broader agenda of stoking domestic economic growth, tax cuts and reducing red tape has fuelled a buying spree across stocks, credit and crypto. The S&P 500 stock index last week hit its 50th record in 2024. Bitcoin has added about 92 per cent so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock’s US$35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost US$1.4 billion on Nov 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Title: Can a company force me to sell my shares?

My 86-year-old father holds 10,000 shares in Balmoral International Land. As mentioned in your paper last month, the directors are seeking an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to implement a forced redemption of his shares and force a significant discount on him so he does not believe the offer is a good faith offer. He believes the redemption is not in the interests of the company but is in the interests of the directors and hence he believes they cannot legally do this. He is a small investor as a hobby and does not know how he can raise his concerns. Can you offer him some help on where he might be able to get advice on this matter? Mr B.G. * The McCann family and what was originally Fyffes have always had a very close relationship. Charles McCann, grandfather of Balmoral chairman Carl McCann, first opened a grocery shop in Dundalk in 1902, becoming the first Irish agent for what was then a small London-based importer of bananas, Fyffes. The business evolved to eventually list in Dublin, initially as FII plc in 1981 and then, from 1990, as Fyffes. After what was, at times, a rollercoaster ride for the family and shareholders, Fyffes split the business up in the back end of the Celtic Tiger. The group’s property interests were spun out as Blackrock International Land in 2006, changing the name in 2010 to Balmoral International Land. The McCanns had a 40 per cent interest in this business from the start so they were always likely to have a strong say in proceedings, not least as many of the rest of the shareholders were very small in scale. A few months after the Blackrock deal, Fyffes spun out its general fresh produce supply business as Total Produce, with the McCanns again holding a double-digit stake in the new company alongside existing Fyffes shareholders. The tropical fresh produce business remains as Fyffes as it was eventually sold to Japanese giant Sumitomo in 2016. Although all three were initially listed businesses with investments held by all former Fyffes shareholders, Balmoral delisted in 2011 after its share price slumped following the property crash in Ireland. In line with recent moves by AIB and PTSB, the company has a shareholder register featuring a few large shareholders and a raft of small stakeholders. According to the circular sent to shareholders in advance of this month’s planned extraordinary general meeting (EGM), of the company’s 5,000 or so shareholders, almost 4,500 hold 500 or fewer shares in the business. To put that in context, that means each of those 4,500 investors has a stake amounting to less than 0.007 per cent of the business. Balmoral says it is receiving an increasing number of requests from shareholders looking for an exit from the investment. Given that many of the original Fyffes plc investors would now be fairly old and others are now holding shares they may have inherited but which they have no real interest in, that certainly sounds plausible. As a delisted business, there was much less liquidity in the shares which trade on the “grey” or unofficial market. There is also the reality that many very small shareholders probably do not have stockbroking accounts and the broker cost of selling the shares would more than wipe out any face value return on the transaction. Balmoral also makes the obvious point that running a small delisted public company with a large shareholder base imposes a burden in terms of cost and administration for the business that takes away from its focus on the core business. The current move to buy out smaller shareholders is not the first. The company announced a Shareholder Redemption and Liquidity Programme last year when it first moved back into a cash positive position after many years, giving it the financial muscle for such a move. Last year, the company said it would spend an initial €2 million to buy back shares – focusing on investors with fewer than 50,000 shares. In an exercise that was purely optional, it agreed to pay seven cent a share. That was higher than the 5.5 cent at which the stock had traded in advance of the offer but sharply below the net asset value of the company’s portfolio which was reported to be 17.93 cent per share, according to its annual report which was published in advance of the buyback. In the event, the company spent €2.56 million buying back 36.6 million shares from 1,344 shareholders – just under 5 per cent of the stock. That exercise brought the McCann family shareholding above 60 per cent. It also implemented a one for 100 consolidation which meant that for every 100 shares you held previously, you now hold just one. Just over one year on, the company’s cash pot has grown again and, it says, it continues to head from shareholders looking to “unlock the value” of their shares. This is in the context where there has been little or no trading in the shares since the July 2023 buyback. So the company is going again, only this time things are different. The big difference is that, now, for many shareholders, the offer is mandatory. Anyone with fewer than 25,000 ordinary shares in the business will have their shares acquired at a price of ¤10.50 a share regardless of whether they want to sell or not. Those who have more than 25,000 shares will also have their holdings acquired as a default unless they opt out of that process. The issue, again, is the price. The €10.50 a share is more than double the price at which Balmoral shares last traded post-consolidation in the “grey market” last November. Since then, stockbrokers have stopped any dealing in the paper-based shares. However, the price equates to just over half of the €18.72 net asset value per share of the company’s portfolio as of the end of June. That’s a big deal. Small shareholders might reasonably expect that in a takeover situation, they would get a premium to its net asset value, or at the very least, parity. And it is effectively a takeover. The large shareholders – led by the McCanns – are ousting smaller fellow shareholders in a company that is finally cash generating as they take it private. And it is a done deal, as holders of over 80 per cent of all shares – including the McCanns – have said they will back the move at the EGM on Thursday week, November 21st in a move that inevitably gives them an even bigger stake in the company. Those eligible for opting out must request a form to do so before 11am on Tuesday next, November 19th, and must return it completed and with any required supporting documents by 6pm on November 28th. I am not sure whether the 10,000 shares that you mention your father has is his holding pre-consolidation or post-consolidation but either way, they will be acquired compulsorily. Is there anything he can do to hold on to the shares? Shareholders do have rights in Ireland but they are limited and the bigger question, in practical terms, is whether it is worth your father – or someone on his behalf – getting involved in the battle. Under the offer price, he will get €105,000 for his shares – assuming the 10,000 shares is a post-consolidation figure. If he were able to hold out for at least 100 per cent of the net asset value, as reported in June, he would receive a total of €187,200. Clearly €82,200 is not to be sneezed at, but in terms of the potential costs involved in trying to block the compulsory purchase of his shares, it would not go very far. And he needs to remember that while shareholders have rights, so do companies in how they manage their affairs. The two ways in which shareholders exercise their rights are by voting at or forcing general meetings of shareholders, and by recourse to law arguing that their rights are being oppressed. Their precise rights in a particular business will be determined by law and by the company’s memorandum and articles of association, or constitution. As a broad rule, a company is obliged to act in the interest of the company as a whole, and not in the interests of a group of shareholders even where those shareholders may be in a majority. All shareholders, including minorities, have property rights. However, given that over 80 per cent of shareholders are backing this motion, I see no way in which your father can force a change of heart at any meeting of shareholders, even if he could find sufficient dissenters to force a special meeting or a motion to this meeting – and time is certainly against him in marshalling any such action anyway. As for the legal route, it must be shown that the act or measure complained of has as its primary motive the advancement of the interests of the majority shareholders as opposed to the interests of the company as a whole – oppression of a group of shareholders and/or disregard of their property rights. The mere fact of the offer price compared with the paper net asset value, and the compulsory nature of the buyout are not in themselves proof of that. Nor is the outcome where the McCanns may hold 80 per cent of the private company. Given the history of the company, the illiquidity of the paper-based shares, the uncertainties surrounding the commercial property market and the unlikelihood of any return to a listed market, at least in the medium term, the challenge facing your father is very significant, quite likely insurmountable. And the financial cost would be very significant. Does it look like the major shareholders and directors are playing fast and loose with the interests of small shareholders? Yes. Can you stop them? In all likelihood, no. Stock investment is a risky game at the best of times, particularly investing in individual stocks rather than exchange traded funds or other pooled investments. Investing in a company exposed entirely to the property market is riskier still. Sometimes it is better simply to cut your losses and move on. I suspect that is his best option here. Any loss that the €105,000 crystallises can be offset against profits he makes on the future sale of other assets he hopefully makes this year or into the future. Any outstanding capital losses still in place when he dies will, as with any tax-liable capital gains, die with him. * This article was edited on Monday, November 11th, 2024 Please send your queries to Dominic Coyle, Q&A, The Irish Times, 24-28 Tara Street Dublin 2, or by email to dominic.coyle@irishtimes.com with a contact phone number.

Title: It’s ‘Unsustainable’—Tesla CEO Elon Musk Issues Serious U.S. ‘Bankruptcy’ Warning Amid Huge Bitcoin And Dogecoin Price Surge

11/12 update below. This post was originally published on November 10 Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire who hit the campaign trail on behalf of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, has been warning recently over a looming "financial emergency."

Musk's fear over the U.S.'s spiraling $35 trillion debt pile comes as the bitcoin price has surged—outpaced by the price of the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin that's boomed thanks to Musk's backing of the Department Of Government Efficiency, nicknamed Doge. Now, as questions swirl around whether Trump could use bitcoin to "wipe out" U.S. debt, Musk has called U.S. debt growth "unsustainable." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's fears over the spiraling U.S. debt pile come as the bitcoin price ... [+] soars following Donald Trump's election victory. "Excess government spending is driving America into bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, adding: "This debt growth is unsustainable." Musk was replying to bitcoin-backing Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who called the "status quo of $2 trillion annual deficits unsustainable." Paul made headlines in 2015 when he began accepting bitcoin campaign donations to support his Republican White House bid—with Donald Trump and many other 2024 candidates following suit—and in 2021 said in an interview he believed crypto could replace the U.S. dollar due to a lack of confidence in the currency and increased government surveillance. 11/12 update: The combined crypto market has blown past $3 trillion, according to Coingecko data, eclipsing its pandemic-era peak despite interest in crypto from the general public remaining well below the levels it reached in 2021. A market wobble this morning failed to much knock bitcoin far from its latest peak of just under $90,000, with the bitcoin price falling to $85,000 before bouncing back to over $87,000. Dogecoin has rocketed 36% over the last 24 hours as traders bet big on Tesla billionaire and dogecoin-backer Elon Musk having a major influence on U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and leaving bitcoin's paltry 7% rally in the dust. "Dogecoin is even more actively destroying skeptics with open positions, "Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. "In 24 hours, it soared 44% to $0.4. It traded sustainably higher for only 15 days in May 2021. This area was pivotal in April and June that year, so it’s worth paying extra attention to it this time around as well." U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Trump floated the idea he could use bitcoin to "pay off our $35 trillion—hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion," he said. In July, Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

[+] approaching $80,000 per bitcoin. Musk's campaign against excessive U.S. spending has resulted in calls for the creation of the Doge Department Of Government Efficiency, which Musk has said he believes could strip $2 trillion from U.S. spending. The Doge department is a nod to the shiba inu doge meme that's also linked to the dogecoin cryptocurrency, named by Elon Musk as his "favorite" cryptocurrency and accepted as payment by his Tesla car company. Doge's association with the dogecoin bitcoin rival has caused the dogecoin price to more than double over the last month, with billionaire Mark Cuban joking Musk could put dogecoin in the U.S. Treasury.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) stands against the other best undervalued stocks. As per Evercore, the equity market rally is expected to further accelerate under the Donald Trump presidency. The S&P 500 is expected to touch 6,600 by June end. This growth in the index is expected to stem from Trump’s deregulatory agency, which should fuel corporate profits. Trump is expected to act fast to enact his policies. The investment firm went on to add that measures such as deregulation and corporate tax cuts are expected to fuel business activity and unlock significant rally in stocks. The bull market’s 2-year run stemmed from healthy growth from mega-cap technology stocks, and high valuations are expected to further rise. Evercore hinted at data demonstrating that the average bull market witnessed an increase of 152% over 50 months, while the current market saw a run-up of only 65% over the previous 25 months. After Donald Trump’s win, economists and market strategists have been assessing how his economic policies might affect the broader US economy and equity markets. While the initial reaction was positive, some experts opine that Trump’s plans might fuel inflation, which will hurt consumers hoping to get some respite from it. Trump’s tax plan revolves around extending the provisions in the TCJA. The provisions are yet to expire at 2025 end. These provisions consist of lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction. Trump’s campaign proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from the current rate of 21%. What will be the impact on the economy? Well, the economy might initially grow moderately under Trump’s plans. That being said, the impact might fade over time, mainly because of the effect of deporting millions of immigrants, as per Oxford Economics. As per the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, the real GDP might grow 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 as compared to the situation if existing policies continue. However, in 2028, the GDP growth might eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 as compared to earlier projections as a result of deportations and increased tariffs. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Consumers tend to rank inflation among their biggest economic concerns. Global economists and market strategists believe that Trump’s Presidency can reignite inflation worries. According to investing legend, Jim Rogers, Trump’s tariffs might increase domestic inflation. As a result, the US Fed will be forced to keep the interest rates high. He further added that higher tariffs on goods, commodities, and products will lead to increased global inflation. Moreover, Trump has plans to deport millions of immigrants. This can also fuel inflation as employers will experience labor crunch, resulting in higher wages. While there are some uncertainties regarding the potential impacts of Trump’s economic policies, market experts believe that investors can go long on stocks that remain undervalued despite the recent rally. To list the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings to extract the list of stocks trading at a forward P/E multiple of less than 15. Next, we selected the stocks which were popular among hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks chart Forward P/E Ratio as of 8 November: 11.00x Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) offers financial products and services in the US, Canada, Asia, and internationally. Market analysts are quite optimistic about Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)’s EPS growth trajectory given the growth potential in Manulife’s Asia and Global Wealth and Asset Management (GWAM) segments. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) continues to pursue strategic initiatives in a bid to enhance shareholder value and optimize its business portfolio. A critical development was the company’s progress in reducing its exposure to legacy risks and Alternative Long-Duration Assets (ALDA). Given Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)’s capital position, analysts believe that it is well-placed to pursue strategic growth opportunities, like acquisitions or investments in high-growth markets, mainly in Asia. Such investments are expected to drive long-term revenue growth and market share expansion, resulting in increased shareholder value. In Asia, Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) can capitalize on the region’s expanding middle class, higher life expectancy, and improved demand for insurance and wealth management products. Its established presence in key Asian markets places it well to capture a larger share of this growth potential. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) has maintained its focus on pivoting to a business model with lower risk and higher ROE. Moreover, it continues to emphasize the quality and productivity of agents in Asia. The company has been expanding its customer reach with the help of strategic partnerships and new product offerings. In Global WAM, Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) completed the acquisition of CQS, which is a U.K.-based multi-sector alternative credit manager. Overall, MFC ranks 8th on our list of the 10 best undervalued stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) The Best Stock Under $100 To Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stands against the other best stocks under $100. Wall Street experts believe that mid-cap stocks might be well-placed for a strong run-up. As per Ryan Detrick (Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group), historically, midcaps outperform once the US Fed actually initiates cutting rates. According to him, the small and mid-caps are expected to surge up to 20% over the upcoming 12 months, far exceeding the large-cap counterparts. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs believes that mid-caps outperform large- and small-cap stocks over the 12 months after the first rate cut. As market experts continue to expect a soft landing, the investors might look for other options apart from the biggest companies. As per the earnings sight report from FactSet dated 1st November, the S&P 500 continues to report mixed results. The Q3 remained strong for risk assets and safe havens, with the US markets delivering an all-time closing high to finish Q3 and bonds posting positive returns, as per JPMorgan Asset Management. Overall, the S&P 500 gaining for 4th straight quarter (making 18 new highs), and the US Treasuries and corporate bonds rallying with the decline in yields dominated much of the movements in Q3 2024. The asset management firm also added that gold saw its biggest gain since Q1 2016 (thanks to the expectations of faster rate cuts) and China’s stimulus supported equity market returns. What is expected for Q4 2024 now? JPM believes that positive expected earnings growth, cooling inflation, easing policies of central banks, and firm job creation should help create a strong backdrop for risk assets. Wall Street analysts believe that mid-caps might be in a position to see strong growth moving forward. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per BofA’s Jill Carey Hall, mid-caps can be considered as the “best hedge” for the near term. According to Hall, the mid-caps have experienced better recent guidance and revision trends and have also surpassed the small caps on average in the downturn scenarios. Mid-caps can also act as a hedge against fewer-than-expected rate cuts, considering that small caps are rate-sensitive. According to Goldman’s Jenny Ma, the start of the rate-cut cycle remains a potential source of incremental equity demand and a boost to broader investor risk sentiment. Moreover, over the short term, mid-cap performance as compared to other segments is expected to be dependent on the strength of economic growth data, along with the pace of the easing cycle. As per Wells Fargo, mid-cap growth stocks are technically oversold as of now. Despite this, these stocks have a significant scope to outperform. It also added that stability in their earnings, risk, liquidity, and balance sheet appear to be more attractive as compared to small caps. With these trends in mind, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. To list the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In, we first used a screener to extract stocks trading under $100. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Stock Price as of November 6: $96.08 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s brand strength stems from its pricing power, attractive unit-level economics, and successful international replication. Wall Street remains optimistic about the leadership change. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) brought in Brian Niccol as its new Chairman and CEO. Analysts opine that his experience in fueling operational efficiencies, improving marketing strategies, and fostering product innovation should be a perfect fit for the company’s current needs. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will continue to benefit from a healthy brand presence and customer loyalty throughout various generational cohorts. Its focus on improving throughput, enhancing digital marketing, and driving product innovation appears to be critical for maintaining and strengthening its competitive edge. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been emphasizing product innovation as a critical driver of customer interest and sales growth. The company’s initiatives which are focused on streamlining operations, optimizing store formats, and leveraging technology for improved efficiency are expected to yield substantial benefits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) from $98.00 to $115.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 16th October. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Similarly, we took advantage of a business reset at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the third quarter to initiate a position in the global coffee retailer. A confluence of factors, including degraded store-level operations and long consumer wait times, consumer fatigue with high prices and weakening engagement among occasional Starbucks customers has led to declining U.S. same-store sales growth. While the path ahead will likely require reinvestment back into the business, there are many merits to Starbucks’ business including its strong brand name and category leading market position. In response to recent challenges, Starbucks has appointed change-agent CEO Brian Niccol, who we know from the Strategy’s ownership of Chipotle Mexican Grill during its turnaround. Niccol has a successful track record of investing in product innovation and fixing execution issues, which we believe are the primary challenges facing Starbucks today. Starbucks represents the kind of successful playbook we have executed on historically – focusing on high-quality businesses and brands while being disciplined around the entry point into investments with attractive risk-reward opportunities.” Overall, SBUX ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks under $100 to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin on cusp of $80,000 for first time on optimism over Trump

Time Published: 2024-11-10T11:27:00Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.3% to an unprecedented $79,771 on Sunday and remained near $79,000 as of 2.05pm in Singapore. Smaller tokens like Cardano and meme-crowd favourite Dogecoin also rallied. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected — his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Bitcoin has added about 90% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak — all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto. Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favourable toward their interests. “Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.
