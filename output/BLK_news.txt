Title: Wall Street backs Ethereum as ETH stablecoin dominance hits 54%

From stablecoins to staking, ETH is becoming the reserve asset of the onchain economy. Ethereum is gaining momentum with a 20% rally, driven by U.S. policy support, growing DeFi demand, and major institutional treasury allocations. Falling Bitcoin dominance and rising Ethereum activity hint at an incoming altseason led by ETH. Ethereum [ETH] is back in the spotlight ‚Äì and this time, Wall Street is watching closely. As stablecoin adoption soars and real-world assets go on-chain, ETH is emerging as more than just a utility token. Ethereum is no longer just the foundation for DeFi and NFTs ‚Äì it‚Äôs fast becoming Wall Street‚Äôs on-chain reserve. With over 54% of stablecoins issued on Ethereum and billions in tokenized real-world assets settling on its network, ETH is now seen as digital collateral akin to Treasuries or gold. These developments come as BlackRock filed to add staking to its Ethereum ETFs. From Fidelity to Electric Capital, institutions increasingly treat Ethereum as a sovereign financial layer where ETH is the reserve asset. Its role in collateralization, settlement, and staking-backed yield positions it as the backbone of the emerging digital dollar economy, reshaping how TradFi views and uses blockchain infrastructure. After months of Bitcoin dominance climbing steadily since December 2024, the tide may be turning. BTC dominance recently broke below a key threshold; mirroring patterns seen ahead of prior altseason bursts. Source: X In previous market cycles, a drop in Bitcoin dominance often led to a capital rotation into altcoins, with Ethereum typically leading the charge. Now, Ethereum is up 20% in the past week, outperforming Bitcoin. Its daily active addresses and transaction volume have hit record highs, signaling strong network engagement. This divergence, combined with falling Bitcoin dominance, suggests a potential regime shift in the crypto market. Historically, Ethereum‚Äôs strength has triggered broader altcoin rallies. If momentum continues, this breakout could be the start of a new altcoin season. Ethereum‚Äôs recent rally isn‚Äôt just driven by market momentum‚Äîit‚Äôs backed by real catalysts. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, pointed to the impact of U.S. legislation like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts, stating: ‚ÄúGENIUS targets yield-bearing stablecoins, and this is great news for Ethereum-based DeFi.‚Äù Institutional confidence is also rising. SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, added $225 million in ETH to its treasury. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, backed by Peter Thiel, has pivoted to Ethereum reserves, now holding over $500 million in ETH. Puckrin believes Ethereum is gaining serious traction: ‚ÄúMomentum is clearly on Ethereum‚Äôs side,‚Äù he said, projecting a near-term test of $4,000. Still, he offered a word of caution: ‚ÄúWhat goes up must come down.‚Äù Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Show HN: molab, a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace
URL: https://marimo.io/blog/announcing-molab
Time Published: 2025-07-18T18:40:30Z

üçÉ Announcing molab: run and share marimo notebooks in the cloud, for free marimo team @marimo_io molab is a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace that lets you rapidly experiment on data using Python and SQL. We‚Äôre giving molab (mo for marimo) to you, our community, for free. To create your first notebook, visit https://molab.marimo.io. To get inspired, check out example notebooks on visualizing embeddings, calling LLM inference providers with HuggingFace by Vaibhav Srivastav from Hugging Face, annotating data with W&B Weave by Scott Condron from W&B, and more. Highlights. Create your first notebook by navigating to https://molab.marimo.io. If this is your first-time using molab, you‚Äôll be prompted to create an account. Each notebook runs in an environment with several popular packages pre-installed, including torch, numpy, polars, and more. marimo‚Äôs built-in package manager will install additional packages as you import them, using uv. As packages are installed, an associated pyproject.toml file is updated, keeping a record of your notebook‚Äôs dependencies. In the near future, we plan to add support for syncing these dependencies, so that the next time you start your notebook it will run with the dependencies you installed. To get a shareable link, click the link icon in the top-right. Notebooks are public but undiscoverable. Notebooks get persistent storage; view the file tree by clicking the file icon in the sidebar. From here you can upload additional data files, which are stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. You can download the notebook directory by clicking the download button, also on the top-right. To run your notebook locally after downloading it, install uv then use uv run marimo edit notebook.py To download the notebook locally, just pass the notebook URL to marimo edit. For example: Today, this brings just the notebook file down, and does not include your attached storage. We launched marimo last year on HackerNews, after incubating it at Stanford and tech startups. Since then, marimo has been downloaded over four million times, with over 300k monthly downloads, blown past Jupyter in GitHub stars (14.5k and counting!), and has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies, cutting-edge startups, and research institutes alike for ML, AI, data engineering, data science, and more. Along the way, our company was backed by the best investors in data. While you can use marimo locally (just pip install marimo), many of you have told us how valuable a marimo-powered Colab-like service would be for running machine learning and AI workloads. In fact, the most popular recent feature request in Google Colab‚Äôs issue tracker asks for marimo support in Colab: Rather than try to convince Google to replace their notebook with marimo, we decided to just build molab instead. marimo is a modern notebook for modern data workflows, so it‚Äôs only fitting that we built molab on a modern tech stack: Making the next generation of interactive computing accessible to everyone. In addition to reinventing the Python notebook, we‚Äôre also on a mission to make marimo accessible to anyone with an internet connection. That‚Äôs why we launched support for WebAssembly notebooks last year, making it possible to run lightweight notebooks entirely in the browser (of course, you can also run marimo on your laptop, on cloud servers, or anywhere you can run software). But while our WebAssembly playground makes snappy interactive compute widely available, it is limited in the packages it supports and the computation it can exploit. molab is our next step in democratizing the next generation of interactive computing: backed by cloud computing, molab lets you create and share notebooks that use any Python package and that run on powerful hardware. We have a lot more planned for molab, but for now ‚Äî please try it out, share feedback, and have fun making awesome notebooks! What‚Äôs the difference between molab and Google Colab? Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service provider. molab is a hosted marimo notebook service with similar compute and sharing capabilities, but powered by marimo notebooks instead of Jupyter. Is molab marimo‚Äôs enterprise product? No. If you‚Äôre interested in a next-generation data platform for modern AI and data workloads ‚Äî with marimo‚Äôs trademark developer experience, complete with security and governance required for enterprises ‚Äî get in touch. I‚Äôm behind the times, what‚Äôs marimo? marimo is an open-source reactive notebook for Python that is designed specifically for working with data. marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python (version with Git), shareable as data apps, executable as scripts or pipelines, reproducible in execution and packaging, have SQL built-in, and make it easy to connect to your own databases and data lakes. marimo has no dependencies on Jupyter or IPython, and is built entirely from scratch. marimo was originally developed with input from scientists at Stanford and developers in industry. With over 300k monthly downloads and 14k GitHub stars, it is now used broadly at companies like Cloudflare, BlackRock, Shopify, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, and universities like Stanford and Berkeley. Is molab free? molab is currently free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks. How do I get more RAM, CPU or GPUs? Reach out to us and we‚Äôll see what we can do! I‚Äôm a compute provider. How do I get plugged into molab as an offered backend? Get in touch. How does molab relate to marimo‚Äôs open source notebook? molab is a hosted version of marimo‚Äôs open source notebook. You can use marimo on your own machine or on your own remote servers. How does molab relate to marimo‚Äôs WebAssembly playground? The WebAssembly playground runs notebooks entirely in the browser through Pyodide. This makes for a snappy user experience, at the cost of limited compute and limited support for Python packages. The playground is well-suited for lightweight notebooks and embedding interactive notebooks in documentation, but it is not well-suited for modern ML or AI workflows. molab is currently entirely separate from the WebAssembly playground. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. How does molab relate to marimo‚Äôs community cloud? Our community cloud provides a place to organize and share WebAssembly notebooks. molab is currently entirely separate from the community cloud. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. ¬© 2025 Marimo Inc. All rights reserved.

Oh, wait. Mamdani isn‚Äôt in office yet. I wonder if New York City law allows pre-arrests. Sort of like being pre-approved for a loan. Well, Mamdani is a socialista, so what did they expect?! A generation from now, the expression ‚ÄúTravis Street‚Äù will replace ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äù after the stock market, investment banks, and the heart of the financial world leaves New York City for Houston. They should have given up on that sh*thole 40 years ago... we dont cede land ! Wall Street has evolved more into a business concept than an actual physical location. Given the technology spawned by the silicon chip, the issuing, trading of stocks, bonds and securities, the supporting legal, printing and bankong services no longer requires people situated in a physical ‚Äúfinancial district‚Äù. Virtually all the business can be conducted via the internet and virtual, instant telecommunications. Why would a businessman wish to locate in a hostile, crime tolerant, high tax area? His competitors will be much more profitable in places like Florida. Mogdani soon won‚Äôt have Wall Street capitalists under his jurisdiction or there to annoy him. Zohran Mamdani another omen that nature tosses in front of you to warn you to watch your step. I think inertia more than anything else has kept them there, along with the nightlife. As more and more rich flee the tax hell of NYC, it will further devolve into a wasteland. They don‚Äôt want to meet with him in public, at least until after the election if he wins, but he‚Äôs still their Democrat. It's all about the quality of life. There's no place like New York. Things change. Cities die. Yes. A city is like an organism. I‚Äôd rather live in a cardboard box in a trash strewn alley than even be in New York. Sounds like Texas or Florida will soon have some new business HQs buildings going up. Someone needs to be made an example of. Better New York City than your home, wherever that may be. Governments easily explained: LIBERALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both cows, slaughters them for their own food, and taxes you to death for worthless social programs, for having the animals originally. PROGRESSIVISM You have 2 cows. Progs advocate for advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization, but they‚Äôre so full of bullshit, nothing ever changes. You still have 2 cows. SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State forces you to give one to your neighbor, shoots the neighbor and forces you to milk them both, giving all milk back to the state. The State gives you a cup of sour milk. LEFTISM You have 2 cows. The State terrrorizes the animals until they can‚Äôt produce milk, beats you and your wife to death, and puts your daughters & sons into the Pedophile Nation, for the Epsteins, Weiners, Clintons etc. MARXISM You have 2 cows. The government takes both and tosses you into a hog pen, where you‚Äôre devoured and never found. COMMUNISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and gives you nothing. They shoot your family and put you in a gulag. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, promises more free cows, lets you vote and gives you sour milk. FASCISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and sells you some milk. NAZISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both and shoots your wife and kids. ANARCHISM You have 2 cows. The State shoots the cows, you and your family. CRONY CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, milks, slaughters them, and makes a tidy profit from the sale of choice meat cuts and fresh milk. You get some lousy hamburger and a jar of sour milk. BUREAUCRATISM You have 2 cows. The State takes both, shoots one, hires a sub-contractor to milk the other, and then throws the milk away. CONTEMPORARY WALL STREETISM You have 2 cows. You sell one, bundle the other with a goat, a mule, and two dry cows. You pile into the derivatives market, buy a Gulfstream and when it all comes down around your ears... You go to the government for a bailout. TRADITIONAL CAPITALISM You have 2 cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. SURREALISM You have 2 giraffes. The government taxes ever penny you get, and then gives you a government grant, from your own money, but only if you take harmonica lessons. Who is paying Cuomo to run? The communis? I can't see how some people will vote for him especially after what he did during covid. I‚Äôm sure some well-placed large donations will ease the friction between the Masters of the Universe and NY‚Äôs new socialist overlord.

Title: Lido rallies 21%, hits 2-month high ‚Äì Can LDO bulls hold on?

LIDO DAO surges 21% to a 2 months high as investors rush into the market following Blackrock‚Äôs filing of ETHA staking LIDO surged 21.53% hitting $1.15, then retraced to $1.13. Buyers rushed into the market following Blackrock‚Äôs filing for ETHA staking, scooping up over 60 million tokens. Lido [LDO] rallied 21.53% reaching a 2-month high of $1.15 before slightly retracing to $1.13 by press time. As a result, the altcoin‚Äôs market cap reclaimed $1 billion mark for the first time in two months. At the same time, its trading volume surged 219.9% to $471 million, reflecting growing demand and network activity. But what triggered the surge? According to AMBCrypto, the price uptick is in part driven by BlackRock‚Äôs recent filing to add staking to its Ethereum ETF [ETHA]. This move is significant for Lido because staking mainly happens through LDO. Thus, all ETH staking processes will run through LDO, something that most market participants have interpreted as a bullish signal. Significantly, this move to stake ETH through a third party could boost demand for Lido‚Äôs stETH derivatives, thus enhancing POS. Following BlackRock‚Äôs filing, investors rushed into the market to accumulate the altcoin. According to Coinalyze, Lido Dao saw 48.6 million in Buy Volume compared to 45.7 million in Sell Volume on July 17th. At the time of writing, the altcoin recorded 15.3 million in Buy Volume relative to 13.4 million in Sell Volume. As a result, the altcoin experienced two consecutive days of positive Buy-Sell Delta, at 2.8 and 1.8 million, respectively. Typically, a higher buy volume indicates strong market conviction as investors shift to aggressive accumulation. Unsurprisingly, as LDO prices rallied, so did the profit-taking urge by holders and investors in equal measures. Spot Netflow hiked to a 6-month high of $5.2 million before dropping to $2.77 million as of this writing. Source: CoinGlass A high Netflow implies increased Exchange Inflow compared to Outflow, a clear sign of aggressive selling. For that reason, Lido Finance‚Äôs scarcity has been evidenced by the declining Stock-to-Flow Ratio. According to Santiment, SFR declined to 26.4, reflecting an increase in LDO available for immediate sale on Exchanges. Source: Santiment Typically, a lower scarcity precedes lower prices amid mounting downward pressure on an asset. According to AMBCrypto‚Äôs analysis, Lido saw a strong uptrend as buyers rushed into the market following good news. As a result, the altcoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged to 78, at press time, touching overbought territory. At the same time, DMI spiked to 41, indicating strong upward momentum and its potential for continuation. Source: TradingView When these momentum indicators are configured in this manner, they suggest that Lido may continue to make gains. That said, if buyers can hold on and continue accumulating, LDO could target $1.4. However, profit takers pose a threat to the continued uptrend, and if they overwhelm buyers, a pullback is likely to follow. If LDO faces rejection here, the altcoin will find support around $0.97.

Haftar is now positioning himself as a gatekeeper to offshore gas corridors and international recognition. With Turkey‚Äôs foreign minister engaging at the UN on Cyprus, Libya‚Äôs new maritime push creates leverage for Ankara on multiple fronts: it pressures Greece, undercuts Egypt‚Äôs quiet coordination with Haftar‚Äôs rivals in Tripoli, and signals continued Turkish reach in Mediterranean maritime negotiations. The note verbale is unlikely to result in enforcement but reshapes the legal-political map enough to keep energy and boundary negotiations unsettled, and both Ankara and Haftar benefit from this ambiguity. Discovery & Development ConocoPhillips is ramping up oil exploration in Alaska‚Äôs National Petroleum Reserve, aiming to drill four wells and run seismic surveys over 300 square miles this winter. The push comes as the company looks beyond the $7B Willow project, which is set to start flowing 180,000 bpd by 2029. New activity is backed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump, mandating at least five lease sales and a rollback to Trump-era rules. Conoco sees Alaska as a long-term oil play with 8.7 billion barrels still on the table. Azule Energy, the BP‚ÄìEni joint venture, just struck gas in Angola‚Äôs first-ever exploration well dedicated solely to gas. Drilled in Block 1/14 of the Lower Congo Basin, the Gajajeira-01 well hit pay with over 1 Tcf of gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, according to early estimates. The find is being called a turning point for Angola‚Äôs gas ambitions, which have long played second fiddle to oil. Azule operates the block with 35%, alongside Equinor (30%), Sonangol (25%), and local firm Acrep (10%). Aker BP hit more oil in Norway‚Äôs North Sea, confirming two out of five targets at its Omega Alfa well in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery adds to rising volumes there, with recoverables now pegged at 700 MMboe, up from 650 MMboe after folding in the East Frigg Beta/Epsilon find. Yggdrasil‚Äôs first oil is still expected in 2027, but cost estimates have climbed to $12.1B. Meanwhile, pipelay and topsides construction are advancing fast, and the company‚Äôs broader North Sea and Norwegian Sea projects‚Äîincluding Valhall, Alvheim, Johan Sverdrup, and Skarv Satellites‚Äîare all pushing toward fresh output over the next two years. CNOOC has made another major find in the Beibu Gulf, striking a 211-meter oil and gas pay zone at its WZ10-5S-2d well‚Äîits second big hit in the area after the earlier 283-meter pay at WZ10-5-1Sa. The new well, drilled to 3,362 meters, is the first major breakthrough in China‚Äôs offshore exploration of metamorphic sandstone and slate buried hills. Initial flows hit 400 bpd of crude and 165 Mcf/d of gas, reinforcing CNOOC‚Äôs bet on deep play and buried hill formations. The company says this opens the door to large-scale exploration in mature basins like Beibu, with more production gains likely in the pipeline. Chevron is backing a $100M exploration push in Peru‚Äôs offshore Block Z-62, partnering with Anadarko after seismic studies revealed signs of a new oil and gas field. The block, located off La Libertad and Lambayeque, could help Peru close its hydrocarbon trade gap‚Äîcurrently importing double the diesel it produces. The plan includes drilling five exploratory and ten confirmatory wells‚Äìa significant step in boosting domestic output. Peru‚Äôs energy ministry is framing the project as a critical step toward energy security and long-overdue reactivation of its oil and gas sector. Equinor‚Äôs wildcat well 34/6-8 S in the North Sea‚Äôs Garantiana NV prospect came up dry, with no hydrocarbons found in the Cook Formation target. The well, drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic rig, hit 105 meters of Cook Formation but encountered only water-bearing sandstone. It‚Äôs the eighth well in PL 554 and has now been permanently plugged and abandoned. This follows another dry hole at the Lit prospect, though Equinor did recently score a gas find at its Skred prospect in the Barents Sea. Assam is now the first state in India with a direct stake in crude production, following a hydrocarbon discovery at the Namrup Borhat-1 well. Through a likely 10% interest via Assam Hydrocarbon and Energy Co., the state will share in both the revenue and risk alongside Oil India Ltd. (OIL). Assam already ranks #3 in India‚Äôs onshore crude output, but this shift from royalty recipient to equity partner puts it in a new league. Chief Minister Sarma called it a milestone for energy security and a signal that Assam is done playing a passive role in India‚Äôs oil story. BlackRock is leading a group set to invest around $10B in Saudi Aramco‚Äôs massive Jafurah gas project, marking another pipeline-style leaseback deal. Like Aramco‚Äôs 2021 infrastructure transactions, the group won‚Äôt own the assets outright‚ÄîAramco keeps control while paying tariffs to investors for using the pipelines and processing facilities. Jafurah is Aramco‚Äôs $100B shale gas bet, touted as the largest non-U.S. shale project, and key to boosting Saudi gas output 60% by 2030. For Saudi Arabia, it‚Äôs another way to cash in on energy assets without relinquishing control, while shoring up funds for economic diversification. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions SLB just locked in final approval for its $7.8B merger with ChampionX after the UK‚Äôs CMA signed off on a package of divestitures aimed at easing monopoly fears. The deal‚Äîdelayed for months by regulatory scrutiny‚Äîwill close Wednesday, giving SLB new firepower in production chemicals and drilling services. To get it done, SLB and ChampionX agreed to offload overlapping UK assets, sell ChampionX‚Äôs US Synthetic unit, and license quartz sensor tech to competitors. Norway's competition authority had already greenlit the deal in April, clearing the last real hurdle. Perenco has wrapped up its acquisition of Woodside‚Äôs Greater Angostura assets in Trinidad & Tobago, securing operatorship of offshore fields producing 50,000 boepd. The deal includes stakes in the 2(C) and 3(A) PSCs plus an onshore terminal, and pushes Perenco‚Äôs T&T output above 100,000 boepd. The move deepens its foothold in the region and boosts gas output to over 500 mscfd. Perenco says it's banking on its expertise in mature fields to extend the life of Angostura while backing T&T‚Äôs economic growth. To access this exclusive content...

Full Content:
Why, pray tell, would the nation‚Äôs biggest public pension fund that also runs its own health insurance program hire a general counsel with no experience whatsoever in investment management, financial regulatory compliance, insurance, government public disclosure and other state agency requirements, and instead had been a private sector criminal defense attorney? Oh, and by credible rumor, one who was looking for a new gig because he wasn‚Äôt generating fees at the level that his law firm expected of partners? Hiring a crook-protector like Matt Jacobs as general counsel sure looked like a statement of CalPERS‚Äô ‚Äòintent to engage in less than savory conduct. Shortly after she joined CalPERS as CEO, Marcie Frost asked to meet us for dinner. She reneged when she realized I intended to treat the discussion on the record. At the time, I told her she should fire Jacobs. The Matt Jacobs rap sheet below shows our recommendation to have been well warranted. These and many more posts document either his complicity in trying to cover up rather than correct CalPERS‚Äô bad actions, or his direct role in dereliction of duty, above all in making sure CalPERS had adequate controls and procedures. So we can take only a tiny bit of comfort from the fact that Matt Jacobs is retiring at the end of this month. It should have happened a long time ago. Remember this is only a partial list. Take note of the range and significance of misconduct: Board Member JJ Jelincic Calls Out CalPERS‚Äô ‚ÄúRoy Cohn,‚Äù General Counsel Matt Jacobs How CalPERS General Counsel Matt Jacobs Violated California Bar Rules Corruption at CalPERS: General Counsel Matt Jacobs as Exemplar of Culture of Casual Lying * * * CalPERS Hired a Fiduciary Counsel Accused of Serious Misconduct Over More Than a Decade, Including Kickbacks, Failure to Disclose Conflicts of Interest CalPERS, CalSTRS, Other Investors Have Indemnified Private Equity Criminal Conduct Even Though Fiduciary Counsels Say No * * * CalPERS Illegally Trying to Hide Its Scheming to Hand Over Private Equity to BlackRock * * * Dow Jones Sent Mother of All Nastygrams to CalPERS Over Its Massive Copyright Infringement; New York Times Called It Outrageous, Brazen, Possibly Unprecedented ‚ÄúHeads Should Roll at CalPERS‚Äù: Who Should Be Held Accountable for Massive Copyright Infringement?

From CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng Resigns Following Our Exposing His False, Felonious Financial Disclosure Filings and Private Equity Conflicts of Interest: CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng resigned effective Wednesday August 5. This was less than three days after we exposed Meng having made multiple felonious1 false statements on financial disclosure forms as well as holding investments in private equity firms when CalPERS was making multi-hundred-billion dollar commitments to them.2 Since Meng was seen in the office in routine internal meetings Wednesday morning, it appears his departure was not voluntary. We were also first to break the story of his resignation, via Twitter; you can read the press release here: We have from two sources that CalPERS CIO Ben Meng has submitted his resignation, presumably due to: https://t.co/mnfZHyd0eG ‚Äî Yves Smith (@yvessmith) August 6, 2020 This outcome was a self-inflicted wound. Remember that the Forms 700 that exposed Meng‚Äôs misconduct went first to CalPERS, which then sends them to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Apparently no one reviewed the documents, much the less suggested Meng correct them, even though CalPERS‚Äô written policy is that the Form 700 is to be submitted in time so that the employee‚Äôs supervisor, which in Meng‚Äôs case was CEO Marcie Frost, can review it. Apparently, no one checked the Form 700 against Meng‚Äôs trading records, which CalPERS should also have on file. Apparently, no one even told Meng to amend his form when CalPERS was about to post it on CalPERS‚Äô site. And we will see when we get the results of our Public Records Act request, but it appears likely that CalPERS did not require Meng to recuse himself on private equity investment pitches from the firms whose stocks he held: Ares, Blackstone, and Carlyle‚Ä¶. CalPERS accelerated its decay when it chose a white-collar defense attorney, Matt Jacobs, as General Counsel in 2014. Despite having sworn an oath to defend the laws of California and having constitutional duties that make protecting beneficiaries paramount, Jacobs clearly sees his job as shielding the executive team. And that has included thwarting board members in making what at any well-functioning institution would be non-controversial inquiries, like getting senior management resignation letters, copies of procedure manuals, minutes of closed session board meetings, and internal audit reports. Jacobs has repeatedly sullied CalPERS by regularly telling falsehoods in public, which is toxic model for an institution‚Äôs top compliance officer. The examples are too numerous to catalogue in full‚Ä¶ Needless to say, this conduct is deeply corrosive. It telegraphs to employees that something is deeply wrong. People whose job it to tell the truth think there is no payoff for doing the right thing, only punishment. This message has been powerfully reinforced by Frost and Meng forcing out some of the few remaining competent executives: Elisabeth Bourqui, apparently for questioning a ‚Äúprivate equity new business model‚Äù that eventually died under the weight of its own contradictions, and then two highly regarded investment professionals, Ron Legnado and Paul Mouchakka. Yet the CalPERS board, unwilling to look at its own culpability in this run of escalating scandals, chooses to blame commies under the bed, um, supposed pension haters. In fact, as we have catalogued, these transgressions were all unforced errors that merely adequate oversight would have prevented. There would be almost no bad stories about CalPERS if CalPERS didn‚Äôt keep generating them. Although CalPEERS has some competition from the disastrously underfunded and deeply corrupt Kentucky Retirement System, CalPERS under Marcie Frost has done more to damage the image of public pension funds in the US than any other force. From Criminality, CalPERS Style: Board Members Misappropriate Public Funds by Signing Blank, Undated Expense Forms: Pictures really can be worth a thousand words. The images below and related evidence demonstrate conclusively that many, perhaps most, CalPERS board members have been filing fraudulent expense forms on a regular basis, some over a period of years. This is a written policy, codified in CalPERS‚Äô board manual and is clearly intended to circumvent California state requirements. The Board Services Unit, which reports to the Board President, asks board members to pre-sign blank sheets of paper with just a blank signature line printed on them. The Board Services Unit later prints onto that signed blank page the body of the travel claim form, with the dollar amounts and date filled in, and submits it on board members‚Äô behalf. Importantly, the form that CalPERS board members have been endorsing in blank requires the signature to certify a statement contained immediately above the signature that validates the accuracy of the information submitted on of the form. As you can see in one of the photos below, that certification is deliberately omitted from the nearly blank page that the board members sign in advance‚Ä¶. As Andrew Silton, former Chief Investment Officer for North Carolina, said by e-mail: There‚Äôs a pretty simple rule in the realm of public pension management. You don‚Äôt sign blank signature pages whether it‚Äôs an investment management contract or an expenditure report. During my tenure as CIO for North Carolina we sometimes had to go to great lengths to get entire contracts and reports into the hands of the State Treasurer (the sole fiduciary) because he had to know what he was signing. Whether he was committing the pension to a multi-million dollar contract or requesting reimbursement for a few hundred dollars of travel expenses, he was drawing funds that belong to the pension trust. His signature, and at times my signature, had to be attached to completed documents. Filling out expenditure reports was often a cumbersome task, and I needed help on numerous occasions to get the figures into the correct boxes on North Carolina‚Äôs expenditure form. So I suppose it would have been convenient to just sign a bunch of blank forms and dump a stack of receipts on someone‚Äôs desk. Aside from violating the law, this would have sent a terrible signal to staff and invited abuse. Travel expenditures are a precious commodity in pension management. They allow fiduciaries and staff to perform proper due diligence. When abuses are unearthed (e.g. padding expense reports) public pensions tend to crack down. Not only is the abuse addressed, but legitimate travel is also curtailed. The board of CalPERS shouldn‚Äôt need any training or lawyers to help them understand the importance of protecting the expenditure process. It‚Äôs amazing to me that all but a few board members at CalPERS seem to have no qualms about signing blank expenditure forms. Once again, it appears that senior staff rather than the board is in control at CalPERS‚Ä¶ On January 15, the day before Margaret Brown‚Äôs first day as a board member at CalPERS, she attended an orientation meeting with fellow incoming board member David Miller. Members of the Board Services Unit, all but one of whom are relatively low-level administrative staff, led the briefing. They gave Brown a raft of forms to sign and hand back to them. This is what she was given: Brown signed them in front of staff before saying she wanted to look at them some more and took the folder with the signed copies with her. She did not return them‚Ä¶. Note that the certification language that sits right above the signature line has been omitted from the blank form Brown was asked to sign: I HEREBY CERTIFY That the above is a true statement of the travel expenses incurred by me in accordance with DPA rules in the service of the State of California. If a privately owned vehicle was used, and if mileage rates exceed the minimum rate, I certify that the cost of operating the vehicle was equal to or greater than the rate claimed, and that I have met the requirements as prescribed by SAM Sections 0750, 0751, 0752, 0753 and 0754 pertaining to vehicle safety and seatbelt usage. And it is no accident that Brown and Miller were asked to sign about 20 copies of each form. This is a page from the CalPERS Board Manual: As the images show, the Board Services Unit instructs board members sign undated forms in blank, with the body of the form, including critically, the certification language removed.1 Staff prints the rest of the form, including the missing certification language, into the pre-signed document when they also fill in expense information and submit it on behalf of the board member‚Ä¶ The implication of the institutionalized practice of: 1) using pre-signed partial forms, 2) using them to fabricate documents that are falsely submitted as complete originals, and 3) using them as the basis for making of payment is that the current Board President, Priya Mathur, her predecessor, Rob Feckner, and members of the Board Services Unit have suborned board members to provide false certifications on an ongoing basis. In addition, both the pre-signing of the travel claim forms and the submission of the false certifications is criminal conduct. Per Title 12 OF CRIMES AGAINST THE REVENUE AND PROPERTY OF THIS STATE, Section 424: (a) Each officer of this state, or of any county, city, town, or district of this state, and every other person charged with the receipt, safekeeping, transfer, or disbursement of public moneys, who either: 3. Knowingly keeps any false account, or makes any false entry or erasure in any account of or relating to the same; or, 4. Fraudulently alters, falsifies, conceals, destroys, or obliterates any account; Section 424(a)3 is colloquially called the ‚Äúmisappropriation of public funds‚Äù statute. Merely providing a ‚Äúfalse account,‚Äù as in false certifications or doctored records, is a crime in and of itself. In addition, Chapter 8 of the California Government Code makes conspiracy a crime, and defines it broadly in Section 182: (a) If two or more persons conspire: (1) To commit any crime. This means that not only have the ‚Äúofficers of the state‚Äù meaning Board Presidents Mathur and Feckner, along with any board members who pre-signed travel expense forms, apparently misappropriated public funds as defined under the law, but they and the members of the Board Services Unit who prepared and submitted the forms also look to have committed an additional felony, that of conspiracy. Summarizing from this detailed post: Brown voiced her concern about this practice to a board member who was also an attorney, who confirmed that no one should ever sign a blank form. Matt Jacobs overheard the discussion, said it was improper and needed to stop, and said he would speak to Board President Priya Mathur about it. Whatever Jacobs said to Mathur was apparently unserious. Rather than Mathur halting the practice and telling board members pronto that new procedures were to be implemented, Mathur scheduled a call with Brown. Brown e-mailed Mathur and told her about the practice and why she was concerned about it. Mathur replied by e-mail she would look into it and get back to Brown. As we described in the post, Brown did not hear back and there was no evidence any corrective action was taken at the time our post ran, months later. So Jacobs couldn‚Äôt be bothered to pressure Mathur to fix something so obviously improper yet easy to remedy. This incident may help readers will understand the disgust with which I view his, Marcie Frost, and many other board members‚Äô lazy, corrupt, and self-serving conduct. And a favorite with some, CalPERS General Counsel Matt Jacobs Violated ‚ÄúZero Tolerance‚Äù Policy via Manhandling CEO Marcie Frost; Will CalPERS Sanction Jacobs or Change the Policy?: As much as we enjoy mining the seemingly bottomless vein of misconduct at CalPERS, we feel compelled to commemorate an incident from last week‚Äôs offsite because it so deeply offended the people who saw it live ‚Äî many of them CalPERS beneficiaries who are retired after decades of honorable government service. This incident, of General Counsel Matt Jacobs literally draping himself over CEO Marcie Frost‚Äôs shoulders for a long tete-a-tete, was a cut-and-dried violation of CalPERS‚Äô Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation Prevention Policy. It epitomizes CalPERS‚Äô hypocritical and two-faced posture toward board members and senior staff, by which members of the power faction are never held to account or even criticized. By contrast, those who are seeking to clean up CalPERS‚Äô misconduct and incompetence are often severely sanctioned, in ways designed to interfere with the performance of their fiduciary duties.1 ‚Ä¶Reports from a half dozen independent sources show that these witnesses were appalled. In fact, the degree of upset was what led one observer to take the pictures above, noting: Matt ‚ù§Ô∏è Marcie. CalPERS Santa Rosa off-site. I was a little slow with my camera, so I missed the minutes-long embrace from the other side ‚Äî because I couldn‚Äôt believe that this was actually happening. I was sitting with a woman from XXX and a woman from YYY who both attend SCORE. There was a third woman who I had just met that day who was a [former government job]. They were freaking-out. It started looking like a casual huddle to whisper, but it lingered on-and-on to the point that the women were saying, ‚ÄúSomebody take a picture, this is completely inappropriate!‚Äù Jacobs had draped himself over both of Frost‚Äôs shoulders with his left arm, his hand casually cupping one of them. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was a ‚Äúpower move‚Äù to dominate her or if there was some sort of creepy mutual cuddle-thing going on, because I couldn‚Äôt see their faces. He‚Äôs huge and she‚Äôs tiny; which made the whole incident even creepier from the peanut gallery. Just a horrible ‚Äúlook‚Äù smack in front of a group of retired female shop-stewards. There‚Äôs also still a soup√ßon of salaciousness. Other reactions, each from additional sources: Audience Member 1: Attorney Mr Jacobs went to CEO Ms. Marcie Frost and proceeded to put his arm around her shoulders to have a private conversation, he then went to board President Mr. Jones and CEO Ms. Frost and repeated this act from the other side. During this interaction the previously mentioned board member [Theresa Taylor] glanced at this interaction and said nothing. I found the interaction as unacceptable staff interaction and the non action of the board member as conflicting‚Ä¶Persons seated near me commented that the interaction appeared to be inappropriate contact between supervisor and subordinate. Audience Member 2: His behavior was unsettling. I don‚Äôt know if he was being controlling or sexual towards little Marcie but it was unprofessional at best and sexual at worst. Audience Member 3: It wasn‚Äôt appropriate For a staff member and his boss. It was sexual harassment. Audience Member 4: It was gross. It looked like it could have been sexual but I doubt that. It reminded me more of a big dog we had. He‚Äôd put his paw on other dogs to show he was the boss. It is noteworthy that most of the individuals above were older women. Generally speaking, older women grew up in an era where sexual banter and flirting in the workplace were seen as acceptable within bounds. The fact that women of this age group were deeply disturbed suggests that young women would have been even more upset. But as the last comment made explicit, they were disturbed by the power dynamic. By putting his hands on Frost and keeping them there, Jacobs was making a big and very public display of his dominance. The State of California and many government bodies in the state trust CalPERS to handle their money, when most candy stores are better managed. While we can lay a lot of blame for the terrible controls, disregard for the law, and persistent preference for cover-ups rather than clean-ups, the buck ultimately stops with Governor Gavin Newsom. If he‚Äôs serious about a Presidential bid in 2028, it would behove him to shake up CalPERS lest some big creepie crawlies emerge during his campaign. Another shocking expos√© on these criminal clowns, but just a heads up Yves that your internal links in this piece are broken (unless a user has WordPress admin access at NC) Oh, hell, it will be a huge process to fix them manually. But I am on to it. Just logging off for the night so just a quick comment. It has not escaped my notice of the colour of those postal notes saying ‚Äòsignature only please. no date.‚Äô Just sayin‚Äô. But now the real fun and games start. CalPERs choosing somebody to fill Jacob‚Äôs shoes. Like with Meng, that have had some spectacular fiascos in choosing new people that would be amenable to the, ahem, mysteries ways of CalPERS. I look forward to the resulting posts on what they do. I would not trust Governor Gavin Newsom to do anything effective in reforming CalPERS. At best he will be theatrical, saying all the right words because he is connected to all the corruption in all levels of California‚Äôs government. As a mediocre white-collar criminal defense attorney tasked with advising the largest public pension trust fund in the country, Jacobs brought a mix of willful ignorance of the law and a stubborn obsession to run roughshod over it in order to push money out the door to the ‚Äúright people,‚Äù no matter the terms. He is emblematic of an over-subscribed legal profession in which lawyers simply bloviate their ‚Äúopinions‚Äù to clients without reference to fact, statutory, or decisional law. Newsom would be wise to pressure his factotums on the CalPERS Board of Administration to appoint a new General Counsel who understands the fiduciary obligations of a pension trust. The mis-doings at CalPERS are about to blow up in his face and it will be a better look for him to fix them (and blame his predecessors) than to persist in trying to cover them up‚Ä¶ My understanding is that the CalPers Board are not direct state employees. Their pay is quite variable. Some double-dip. some don‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs a 2014 article on CalPers by the SacBee newspaper: https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article4071012.html The article is quite long and you‚Äôll discover why the ‚Äòundated‚Äô travel/expense forms are so useful. This has NOTHING to do with what David in Friday Harbor said and comes off as an unwarranted correction/reprimand. And what they get paid or not paid similarly has nada to do with their legal obligation to handle expenses or board matters generally in accordance with the law. Some are automatically on the board as state officers, namely the state Treasurer. and Comptroller. Others are appointed from different candidates for particular seats by the Governor or legislature. Six seats are elected. One seat is for retirees and so is not a current employee and receives only a modest stipend. Ditto the ex-officio members and the gubernatorial and legislative appointees Of the elected seats, the ones that are currently employed do not quit their jobs to serve on the CalPERS board. They instead get ‚Äúrelief time‚Äù, as an a reduction of hours while still receiving full pay, to allow for time spent at CalPERS The issue is that they are all state officers in their capacity as CalPERS board members and subject to various state laws related to that status. Great post! But it also re-raises the question I always ask myself. Namely with so much money being so poorly managed by a state organization over so many years why is this still ongoing and has not been cleaned up? I can‚Äôt help but think that someone benefits by CalPERS being such a mess, but haven‚Äôt a clue who they might be or why (besides greed). Any ideas? The main beneficiaries are the Congressional Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and now Adam Schiff ‚Äî who live off the largesse of high-fee Private Equity and Real Estate managers (even though the GOP probably gets more money from them) ‚Äî the California Democrats and public employee unions ‚Äî who are relieved of fundraising obligations to the DCCC and the DNC as a ‚Äúbehestment‚Äù for CalPERS high-fee largesse ‚Äî and the unions who see high PE and RE fees as a ‚ÄúStockholm Syndrome‚Äù buy-off that prevents Stanford‚Äôs Joe Nation from running a ballot initiative to switch CalPERS to a Pinochet/Thatcher style defined-contribution system. Jacobs was a proteg√© of Barbara Boxer, the former U.S. Senator from Brooklyn via Marin County, who made it her mission to recognize Tribes so that they could open flashy casino gambling dens up and down the Golden State ‚Äî with clumsy kick-backs to her ne‚Äôer-do-well son Doug. Apparently Jacobs‚Äô one job was to keep the money flowing out the door of CalPERS to the ‚Äúright‚Äù people. If you the compare PE and RE management fees that CalPERS pays with the same fees paid by the teachers pension across the river at CalSTRS, you will find that CalPERS pays nearly TRIPLE in fees as a percentage of AUM while generating slightly lower returns. This amounts to over a BILLION dollars every year in excess fees over the decade of Jacobs‚Äô tenure that aren‚Äôt being invested to grow the trust fund. Maybe I have a soft spot for Barbara Boxer as she voted against the AUMF in Iraq while the other CA senator at the time, Feinstein voted for it. But I want to post in Boxer‚Äôs defense. As I recall, as I live in the Sonoma County area, Boxer pushed to recognize the defunct tribe that eventually built the Graton Casino (about 8 miles away from where I‚Äôm writing this) but Boxer had that the tribe would NOT be allowed to do gambling. Her son did lobby for the tribe after the bill passed. From https://indianz.com/IndianGaming/2010/022426.asp ‚ÄúUpdate III: The Hill has determined that their portion of the story has serious factual problems, and was not properly researched. For instance, Boxer did not change the bill to allow gaming; her version of the bill continued the House prohibition on it.‚Äù Here‚Äôs an update about Doug Boxer and his attempted shake-down of the Graton Band: https://consortiumnews.com/2018/11/16/national-exclusive-former-sen-barbara-boxers-son-and-california-powerbroker-found-bilking-indian-tribe/ Crass money-grubbers, if you ask me ‚Äî even if Boxer did come up through the anti-war movement. CalPERS‚Äôs troubles are all about the skim by the politicals. The Repubs were even worse‚Ä¶ Well, thanks for reminding us of all the illegal advice that crook Jacobs brought to CalPERS over a decade ago. Jacobs never gave the Board legal advice, it was legal cover. Matt Jacobs is an expert at justifying the unjustifiable. I remember when Bill Slaton at a public meeting accused me of ‚Äúclear violations of fiduciary duty‚Äù and ‚Äúdisregard for confidentiality of materials or decisions reviewed or made by the Board.‚Äù He could not come up with any examples. However, a month latter Matt Jacobs came up with charges for him. Matt Jacobs labeled his report ‚ÄúAttorney Client Privileged‚Äù so I could not even disclose them nor get my requested public hearing. I still say they are without merit. It‚Äôs worth noting, at my Kangaroo court, Mr. Slaton couldn‚Äôt defend ‚Äúhis‚Äù charges because he said he only knew what Jacobs had written. It‚Äôs also noteworthy that Marcie Frost was given a copy but no Board members were given copies even when they asked. Mr. Jacobs advised the Board that the statutory requirement that security transactions by the staff on behalf of the system be made public was satisfied by reporting the dollar value of transactions by asset class. California law requires that before a state body discusses litigation in closed session ‚Äúthe state body shall state the title of, or otherwise specifically identify, the litigation to be discussed ‚Ä¶‚Äù Mr. Jacobs says ‚ÄúGeneral Counsel‚Äôs Update on Pending Litigation‚Äù satisfies that requirement. Mr. Jacobs seems to forget that as a government attorney he has an obligation to the public. I am not sorry to see him go and hope he enjoys his retirement. Meanwhile, over at UC: University of California fund ditches hedge funds with scathing rebuke ‚ÄúHedge funds are a fantastic business if you‚Äôre on Wall Street, and you can charge a great fee and then you can afford to buy all the art and the private jets and the amazing houses in the world,‚Äù he said. He added: ‚ÄúMy only regret is not the fact that we haven‚Äôt invested in hedge funds, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm not a hedge fund manager.‚Äù https://archive.li/MK7fV CalPERS got out of hedge funds in 2014.

Title: Geopolitical Risks Force Family Offices Into Liquid Alternatives, Cash

Geopolitical uncertainties are forcing family offices out of U.S. equities, diversifying into cash and liquid alternatives, according to BlackRock‚Äôs annual Global Family Office Survey. Global family offices find themselves in ‚Äúrisk-management mode,‚Äù as 68% reported scrambling to diversify their assets. Some 84% of respondents said geopolitical uncertainty is the most important issue for them and is a critical factor in their capital allocation decisions. Alternatives are benefiting from increased allocations and now make up 42% of single-family office portfolios, up from 39% in 2022, according to the data. Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news. ÔÅ° Private credit and infrastructure are the most-favored alternatives. In addition, 32% of family offices reported plans to increase their allocations to private credit, and 30% said they intend to raise their infrastructure allocation in2025-26. Infrastructure is also gaining strong momentum, with 75% of respondents reporting they feel positive about the prospects for the asset class. Armando Senra, BlackRock‚Äôs head of institutional business in the Americas, said with 60% of family offices pessimistic about the global outlook, confidence has been further shaken by new U.S. tariffs. ‚ÄúFamily offices are now prioritizing diversification, liquidity, and structural reassessment of risk as they build resilience in their investment portfolios,‚Äù he said in a statement. Many of the 175 single-family offices surveyed, which collectively have $320 billion in assets, want to collaborate with external partners, especially when it comes to private markets. Many cited gaps in their internal expertise on reporting (57%), deal-sourcing (63%) and private-market analytics (75%). Almost one-quarter (22%) reported using an outsourced chief investment officer or would consider doing so. The majority of respondents said they would also consider using artificial intelligence for a variety of tasks from risk management to cash-flow modelling. Finally, 45% reported being more likely to invest in technology firms building AI solutions, while 51% said they were interested in investment opportunities they believe will benefit from the growth in AI, and 33% reported planning to deploy AI tech internally to improve their investing process.

Title: Ethereum ETF Evolution: BlackRock Aims To Boost ETHA Returns With Proposed ETH Staking
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-evolution/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T13:00:42Z
Full Content:
Spot Ethereum ETFs could be gearing up for a notable shift as crucial efforts are being made constantly to include ETH staking into the exchange products. At the forefront of this key advancement in the ETH spot ETFs is BlackRock, which has recently taken steps to bring this idea into reality. As the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) gain momentum in the crypto sector, BlackRock has taken a bold step to enhance its exchange fund. The largest asset management company has recently filed for an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This move was highlighted in the amended 19b-4 filing submitted by Nasdaq to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Such a move would allow BlackRock‚Äôs fund to use Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake mechanism to increase returns for investors. Thus, the exchange fund could earn rewards by confirming transactions on the ETH network. BlackRock‚Äôs action toward integrating staking in its ETHA marks a pivotal moment for the asset manager and its fund, redefining crypto investment. Should this application get a green light from the US SEC, it is likely to pave the way for a new era of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that combine decentralized financial mechanisms with conventional accessibility. According to TerraNewsEN on the social media platform X, ‚Äústaking in Ethereum ETFs is not new.‚Äù In the X post, the informative platform noted that BlackRock and the US SEC have already discussed this move before the asset manager took a decisive step to submit an application. With positive news swelling around Ethereum, the platform is confident that BlackRock‚Äòs demand for staking will yield promising results, particularly in terms of price. ‚ÄúBlackRock did not acquire ETH for nothing,‚Äù the platform added. While ETH rose to $3,600 mark following the news, TerraNewsEN has highlighted $4,200 as the next critical level for the altcoin to reclaim. If the asset surpasses the $4,200 level, the platform anticipates a massive rally to a new all-time high of $5,000 and beyond. Another exciting news concerning Ethereum that is making headlines in the crypto landscape is GameStop‚Äôs latest attempt to acquire more ETH into its treasury. Filing Tracker reported that the leading retail gaming company could be on the verge of purchasing ETH worth over $70 million. It is worth noting that the $70 million was generated from a public offering where the firm sold about 46,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 each. The report shows that this move is supported by GameStop‚Äôs strategic partnership with Dialectic, a leading crypto native capital management and yield generation.

Title: How the Right Is Waging War on Climate-Conscious Investing
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/leonard-leo-consumers-research-esg-climate/683581/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
A Leonard Leo‚Äìfunded effort to destroy ESG has scared off much of corporate America. In January 2020, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock‚Äîthe world‚Äôs largest asset-management firm‚Äîreleased his annual letter to corporate executives. The letters had become something of a tradition: part investor missive, part State of the Union, dispatched each year from the top of the financial world. This one struck a tone of alarm that would reverberate far beyond Wall Street. ‚ÄúClimate change has become a defining factor in companies‚Äô long-term prospects,‚Äù Fink warned. ‚ÄúWe are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.‚Äù He said that BlackRock would be ‚Äúincreasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress‚Äù on sustainability. The message signaled the degree to which a once-obscure investing philosophy known as ESG‚Äîshort for ‚Äúenvironmental, social, and governance‚Äù‚Äîhad become a boardroom priority. For a moment, it looked like corporate America would weigh carbon emissions alongside profits. More major companies soon announced climate goals and promised new standards of accountability. BlackRock helped lead an effort to elect sustainability advocates to the board of ExxonMobil. A consensus seemed to be forming: Business could be a force for good, and markets might even help save the planet. Now, just five years later, that consensus is crumbling. BP is pulling back on a commitment to invest in renewables‚Äîand is reportedly expanding plans for drilling. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have scaled back their plastic-reduction pledges. Major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, are hedging their climate bets and investing heavily in fossil-fuel companies. Asset-management firms that joined BlackRock in embracing ESG‚Äîincluding Vanguard and State Street‚Äîhave also backed off. And Fink‚Äôs 2025 letter to investors does not even mention the word climate. James Surowiecki: The hottest trend in investing is mostly a sham ‚ÄúThis further exacerbates the problem of slow-walking climate action at a time when the temperature records are being broken and devastating weather events are accelerating,‚Äù Richard Brooks, the climate finance director for Stand.earth, an international environmental-advocacy organization that focuses in part on corporate contributions to climate change, told us. This global retreat has been particularly acute in the United States, where political resistance to ESG has grown into an organized countermovement. The issue is now a fixture in partisan attack ads, Republican statehouse legislation, and right-wing media. The forces arrayed against ESG say they are just getting started. In January, a group of present and former Republican state officials gathered at a posh resort in Sea Island, Georgia, together with conservative leaders, for a two-day lesson in how to dismantle corporate America‚Äôs most ambitious response to climate change. At the Cloister, with its golf courses, tennis courts, and beaches, ESG was denounced as a sinister force undermining free markets and democracy. ‚ÄúI would hope everyone here is pretty much committed to destroying ESG,‚Äù said Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers‚Äô Research, the organization that has led the fight. His group, he said, had spent $5 million running ads ‚Äúeducating consumers‚Äù about the dangers of ESG. Hild spread a similar message at other events this spring, according to transcripts of his remarks that we obtained. ‚ÄúESG is when they use their market share to push a far-left agenda, without ever having to go to voters, without any electoral accountability,‚Äù said Hild at a March meeting of state activists. ‚ÄúThis is not the free market operating. This is a cartel. This is a mafia.‚Äù At its core, ESG investing means integrating nonfinancial factors‚Äîsuch as climate risk, carbon emissions, pollution, and corporate governance‚Äîinto investment decisions, with the idea that these issues could materially affect long-term performance. Firms that offer ESG funds screen out companies that don‚Äôt meet a set of criteria for climate protection, and pitch their products to investors as climate-friendly alternatives to conventional funds. But in the eyes of its critics, ESG investing undermines democratic governance, imposes political priorities through the financial system, and breaches the independence of state financial officers to seek maximum return on investments. ‚ÄúBy applying arbitrary ESG financial metrics that serve no one except the companies that created them, elites are circumventing the ballot box to implement a radical ideological agenda,‚Äù Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in 2023 when he introduced legislation prohibiting the use of ESG investment by Florida pension and other state funds. That narrative has taken hold with a wide swath of Republican leaders. Donald Trump attacked ESG on the campaign trail last year, and in an April 8 executive order, the president said that state-level climate-emissions and ESG laws ‚Äúare fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration‚Äôs objective to unleash American energy. They should not stand.‚Äù The roots of ESG can be traced to faith-based investing of the 18th century, when some religious denominations sought to avoid investment in corporations that promoted trading enslaved people. In the 20th century, the movement called ‚Äúsocially responsible investing‚Äù gained momentum during the civil-rights era and, later, in connection with opposition to apartheid in South Africa. The term ESG was formally coined in a 2004 report by the United Nations Global Compact titled ‚ÄúWho Cares Wins,‚Äù which argued that better corporate integration of environmental, social, and governance factors could lead to more-sustainable markets and better outcomes around the globe. ESG investing grew in the 2010s as the public grew more concerned about diversity, the environment, and executive pay. Major asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street began offering ESG products, and companies competed to establish metrics to track compliance. As the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock played an especially influential role. Because there was no single established metric for meeting climate goals, critics on the left complained that ESG encouraged greenwashing, in which companies claim to be making environmental progress without making an actual commitment. But even critics were forced to concede that ESG brought about increased transparency. In 2018, 34 percent of publicly traded global companies disclosed greenhouse-gas-emission details. By 2023, that share had risen to 63 percent, an increase generally attributable to ESG efforts, according to R. Paul Herman, the founder and CEO of HIP Investor Inc. Although many asset managers noted the difficulties of measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, they embraced ESG as part of their long-term management strategy‚Äîand trillions of dollars flowed to them. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG-fund assets reached around $30 trillion in 2022. The analytics firm forecast in February 2024 that global ESG assets would surpass $40 trillion by 2030. Expectations for ESG have now fallen off dramatically‚Äîand Hild and his three colleagues at Consumers‚Äô Research can claim much of the credit. At seminars such as the one at Sea Island, Hild and his allies armed a network of Republican state attorneys general, state treasurers, and comptrollers with legal and political ammunition. The key funders of such efforts include fossil-fuel-industry executives and Leonard Leo, who is best known for his leadership of the Federalist Society. In recent years, Leo has moved beyond his focus on transforming America‚Äôs courts, vowing in videotaped remarks in 2023 to take on ‚Äúwokeism in the corporate environment, in the educational environment,‚Äù biased media, and ‚Äúentertainment that is really corrupting our youth.‚Äù Beginning in 2021, Leo and his team injected cash into a long-dormant organization that they would use to fight ESG: Consumers‚Äô Research. A spokesperson for Leo told us that ‚Äúwoke companies are defrauding their consumers and poisoning our culture, and Leonard Leo is proud to support Will Hild and Consumers‚Äô Research as they crush liberal dominance in those woke companies and hold them accountable.‚Äù The organization found a receptive audience among Republican state officials eager for a road map to combatting ESG. The group emphasized using leverage that states possess through their management of pension funds to punish investment firms that had signed on to boycott oil and gas companies. Zo√´ Schlanger: The climate can‚Äôt afford another Trump presidency Republican attorneys general from a few fossil-fuel-dependent states, such as Texas and West Virginia, began in 2021 to investigate whether investments tied to ESG guidelines violated state laws. They sent letters of inquiry to major firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard, questioning whether their ESG practices were legally compatible with states‚Äô fiduciary obligations, especially concerning pension funds. That same year, Texas enacted Senate Bill 13, which requires state pension systems and other state endowments to divest from financial institutions seen as hostile to the oil and gas industry. Under that law, the state attorney general‚Äôs office placed more than 370 investment firms on a blacklist‚Äîincluding BlackRock and several divisions of major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The following year, the offensive intensified. A coalition of 19 Republican attorneys general sent a joint letter to Fink, the BlackRock CEO, accusing the company of putting climate goals ahead of financial returns and pressuring corporations to align with international climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement. ‚ÄúBlackRock appears to use the hard-earned money of our states‚Äô citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment,‚Äù the letter warned. It cited proxy-voting strategies and coordination with groups such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative as potential legal overreach. Since 2022, 23 Republican state attorneys general have opened investigations into ESG-focused investment firms. Several of those officials had help from an Arizona-based private firm, Fusion Law, which received $4.5 million from Consumers‚Äô Research in its first two years of existence. One of the firm‚Äôs founders, Paul Watkins, is a former Arizona civil-litigation chief in the state‚Äôs attorney general‚Äôs office‚Äîand was also a legal fellow at Consumers‚Äô Research. ‚ÄúPaul Watkins and Fusion Law have been essential in helping to unravel and document the inner workings of ESG,‚Äù Hild told us. The firm has had contracts to work on ESG-related issues with attorneys general in Tennessee and Utah. Watkins has been a featured speaker at Consumers‚Äô Research events, including the gathering in January. Recently, state-level investigators began probing the question of whether environmental groups, asset managers, and shareholder-advocacy organizations were engaged in collusion, using ESG to restrain trade in fossil-fuel companies, in violation of antitrust laws. The opposition of red-state officials has chilled discussion of sustainable investments at institutional-investor meetings, according to participants, despite accusations of hypocrisy from Democratic officials in blue states. Brad Lander, New York City‚Äôs comptroller, told us that Republicans are distorting investment decisions by putting their thumb on the scale against ESG. ‚ÄúThese are people who once upon a time believed in free markets,‚Äù Lander, a Democrat, told us. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not telling anyone how to invest. I just don‚Äôt want them to tell me.‚Äù Evidence suggests that the Republican push has been costly to taxpayers. A study by the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School of Business found that the Texas law banning municipalities from doing business with banks that have ESG policies reduced the competition for borrowing‚Äîand generated a potential cost of up to $532 million in extra interest per year. Nonetheless, the anti-ESG movement is spreading: What began largely as a state-level attack has now blossomed on Capitol Hill. In mid-2023, House Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, launched a wide-ranging probe into ESG practices. More than 60 entities, including environmental groups, corporations, and financial institutions, were asked to provide information on alleged coordination aimed at limiting fossil-fuel investment. The committee‚Äôs interim staff report, released last year, accused ESG advocates of forming a ‚Äúclimate cartel‚Äù that sought to ‚Äúimpose left-wing environmental, social, and governance goals‚Äù through coordinated pressure campaigns. The report alleged that such efforts amounted to collusion in restraint of trade. During his inquiry, Jordan issued waves of subpoenas targeting organizations such as Ceres, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and the shareholder-advocacy nonprofit As You Sow. Targets of the inquiry were required to turn over more than 100,000 pages of email and other communications as the committee investigated allegations of antitrust violations and collusion in recommending sustainable-investment options. ‚ÄúThe investigation was abusive, and it was chilling,‚Äù said Danielle Fugere, the president and chief counsel of As You Sow, who testified for more than eight hours before Jordan‚Äôs panel last year. ‚ÄúYou cannot defy the reality of climate change and the scientific imperative of acting,‚Äù said Mindy Lubber, the president and CEO of the pro-sustainability nonprofit group Ceres, which has been active in prodding companies into taking part in ESG measures. But, she said, ‚Äúeverybody is afraid of the bull‚Äôs-eyes on their backs.‚Äù Annie Lowrey: If you‚Äôre worried about the climate, move your money Jordan‚Äôs inquiry is continuing this year, with a focus on possible antitrust violations by environmental organizations and asset managers and advisors. The pressure is working as intended. After Jordan launched his inquiry, many high-profile firms exited the Climate Action 100+ initiative. Coalitions of financial institutions that once committed to sustainable investing have collapsed. Several U.S. banks‚Äîincluding JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo‚Äîwithdrew from an influential bankers‚Äô climate coalition, citing legal risk and political pressure. BlackRock and Vanguard pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, leading that group to halt operations. ‚ÄúOur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock‚Äôs practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,‚Äù the company said in a letter to clients. ‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äôs active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.‚Äù The company, which declined our request to interview Fink, referred us to other official statements including one noting that ‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äôs sustainable and transition investing platform is driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets.‚Äù Other asset managers issued similar statements, noting that they would still offer green-investment options. But interest in ESG funds has declined substantially. U.S. investment funds specializing in climate experienced net inflows of $70 billion in 2021‚Äîbut by 2023, the tide had reversed, with money flowing out of the funds faster than it was coming in. Last year, net outflows amounted to $19.6 billion, with the trend continuing into the first quarter of 2025, according to Morningstar Analytics. Proxy initiatives from shareholders interested in sustainable investing have also declined, another casualty of the war against ESG. ‚ÄúThis has been a silent spring,‚Äù William Patterson, a former director for investment for the AFL-CIO who tracks climate-related shareholder action, told us. ‚ÄúInvestor initiatives on climate, which attained broad shareholder support in the past, are barely present‚Äù at investor meetings this year. Meanwhile, the number of anti-ESG proxy proposals more than quadrupled from 2021 to 2024. As of February, a fifth of all shareholder proposals submitted were filed by anti-ESG groups. Despite the precipitous decline of ESG investing, its detractors are not ready to declare victory. Consumers‚Äô Research, for one, is committed to pressing on. ‚ÄúESG is in retreat, but it is not defeated yet,‚Äù Hild told us. ‚ÄúWe have a long way to go before people get rid of it.‚Äù Proponents are not relenting either, and are looking forward to a moment when the political winds shift once more. ‚ÄúWhat I hear, especially in the U.S., is twofold,‚Äù said Daniel Klier, the chief executive of the advisory firm South Pole. ‚ÄúOne message is ‚ÄòKeep your head down,‚Äô but also that climate change will not go away‚Äîand we need to prepare for the decades to come and not just in the next four years.‚Äù

Title: America‚Äôs Worst Polluters See a Lifeline in Power-Gobbling AI‚Äîand Donald Trump

President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House on July 15, 2025, in Washington, as Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt watches in reverence.. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP This story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. AI is ‚Äúnot my thing,‚Äù President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. ‚ÄúYou need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,‚Äù Trump said, recalling a conversation with ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù‚Äîmost likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. ‚ÄúI said, what, are you kidding? That‚Äôs double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.‚Äù At the high-profile summit on Tuesday‚Äîwhere, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods‚Äîcompanies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building ‚Äútitan clusters‚Äù of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania‚Äôs fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country‚Äôs second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice‚Äîwho dubs himself the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs champion of natural gas‚Äù‚Äîmoderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world‚Äôs top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach ‚Äúmulti-decade highs‚Äù over the next few years. A jolt of new demand‚Äîlike the demand represented by massive data centers‚Äîcould revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.‚Äù Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are ‚Äúwhy the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,‚Äù says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast‚Äîresponding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration‚Äôs priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration‚Äôs anti-renewables positions, aren‚Äôt necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn‚Äôt necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate‚Äîmany tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened‚Äîbut rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. ‚ÄúThe waiting list for a new turbine is five years,‚Äù Williams-Derry says. ‚ÄúIf you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‚ÄòI want more solar.‚Äô‚Äù Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an ‚Äúenergy crazy train,‚Äù scoffing at those administrations‚Äô support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant‚Äôs carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We‚Äôre going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive ‚Äú40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,‚Äù while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists‚Äô projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It‚Äôs easy to find any variety of headlines or reports‚Äîoften based on projections produced by private companies‚Äîprojecting massive growth numbers for AI. ‚ÄúI view all of these projections with great skepticism,‚Äù says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.‚Äù In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there‚Äôs ‚Äúa bunch of self-interested actors,‚Äù Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants, and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (‚ÄúDig More Coal‚ÄîThe PCs Are Coming‚Äù was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet‚Äôs energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. ‚ÄúPeople just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,‚Äù he says. There‚Äôs some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. ‚ÄúIt can both be true that there‚Äôs growth in electricity use and there‚Äôs a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it‚Äôs likely to happen,‚Äù Koomey says.

ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management. Nasdaq submitted an updated filing to the SEC to add staking to the iShares Ethereum Trust issued by BlackRock. This came after ETHA saw $499 million in daily inflows, but the price of ETH has not moved much in recent hours. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the 17th of July, BlackRock is looking to upgrade its iShares Ethereum Trust [ETHA] to include staking. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq ‚Äúto permit staking of ether held by the Trust‚Äù. Nasdaq and BlackRock were not the first ETF issuers to push to update their Ethereum spot ETF to include the option for staking. In March, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) group and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) proposed adding ETH staking to Fidelity, Franklin, and Bitwise ETFs. Rival issuers 21Shares and Grayscale have also previously submitted such proposals. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management and saw a $499 million inflow on the 16th of July. Speaking on the topic, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart clarified that staking was ‚Äúnot yet done‚Äú. He said, ‚ÄúStaking is not ‚Äúdone‚Äù. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October.‚Äù Seyffart added, ‚ÄúThe Blackrock filing today won‚Äôt have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25)‚Äù. Vance Spencer, co-founder of crypto-native investment firm Framework Ventures, commented on X: ‚ÄúMaybe you didn‚Äôt expect Lubin and Tom Lee to lead the TradFi bandwagon to ETH, and BlackRock to add staking just as the wheels start to turn. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. There‚Äôs no need to be upset.‚Äù Spencer referred to Joe Lubin and Tom Lee in his post. Lubin is the chairman of SharpLink Gaming, and Lee is a top Wall Street strategist and Head of Research at Fundstrat. SharpLink [SBET] has the largest ETH reserves, surpassing even the Ethereum Foundation. It was reported that SharpLink would offer up to $5 billion of common stock to acquire more ETH. Spencer‚Äôs post highlights TradFi‚Äôs growing interest in Ethereum. He pointed to BlackRock‚Äôs move to add staking to its ETH ETF. This signals rising institutional confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term value. Spencer suggested the shift is already underway, and there‚Äôs no reason to be upset. The price of Ethereum [ETH] has not reacted much since the news came out. The past two hours of trading before the time of writing saw ETH fall 0.53% to $3,409. However, the leading altcoin has outperformed the industry giant Bitcoin [BTC] and its competing Layer 1 altcoin Solana [SOL] comfortably over the past week.

Title: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May‚Äôs Playbook Predicts Another Breakout

After beating the resistance mounted at the $3,000 by bears for months now, the Ethereum price looks primed for a further breakout. Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge. The post highlights the fact that Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways. However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Data from the Farside website shows that Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive net flows for almost two weeks straight now. The likes of BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge with tens of thousands of ETH being bought up daily. Ethereum treasury companies are now the rave of the moment as the likes of SharpLink and BitMine begin accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH. This rise in institutional adoption has become one of the major pushes for Ethereum as investors clamor for new highs.

Title: All-Ireland hurling final: Joe Canning‚Äôs Cork player profiles

Full Content:
Age: 28 Club: Ballinhassig Debut: v Limerick, 2021 His long puckouts to Brian Hayes are a key weapon for Cork, but Collins is good at medium-range deliveries too and his puckouts to Tim O‚ÄôMahony were particularly impressive in the semi-final. In some situations, like for Limerick‚Äôs goal in the Munster final, he needs to stay on his feet longer. Age: 27 Club: Castlelyons Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 O‚ÄôLeary is a no-fuss kind of player: tight and tough. I don‚Äôt think Cork will worry about match-ups in their full-back line. O‚ÄôLeary loves a one-on-one battle and he‚Äôll be trusted to pick up whoever comes into his corner. One of Cork‚Äôs best players in the league, he has carried that form into the championship. Age: 22 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 For many years after Diarmuid O‚ÄôSullivan retired, number three has been a problem for Cork. Downey has nailed down the position now. Occasionally he looks vulnerable in the air, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a weakness. He had a brilliant final last year, but John McGrath‚Äôs movement and intelligence will ask some questions. Age: 29 Club: Inniscarra Debut: v Clare, 2018 Lost the captaincy at the beginning of the year and it looked like he might be under pressure to hold his place. However, O‚ÄôDonoghue has been brilliant this season. Marked Darragh McCarthy in the league final and was lined up to mark him again in the championship until McCarthy was sent off in the first minute. Age: 23 Club: Castlemartyr Debut: v Limerick, 2022 Even though he likes to do a bit of hurling, Joyce is Cork‚Äôs go-to man marker in the half-back line. I expect him to tag Jake Morris and the outcome of that duel will have an impact on the result. Has also done well at centre back during the championship when Robert Downey was injured. Age: 25 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Limerick, 2019 Has had an injury-interrupted season but made an impact off the bench in the Munster final and was commanding against Dublin, especially under the high ball. Andrew Ormond will pose a different test this weekend and I think Tipp will target Downey‚Äôs channel with pace. Age: 27 Club: Blarney Debut: v Wexford, 2016 Had a good final last year and his overall form this season is much better than last year. Very good going forward and delivers quick ball into his forwards, but not as effective going towards his own goal. Sam O‚ÄôFarrell will have defensive duties in his own half, though, and that will suit Coleman. Age: 28 Club: Newtownshandrum Debut: v Clare, 2018 O‚ÄôMahony is the engine of the team and when he‚Äôs going well Cork seem to go well. When he didn‚Äôt have an influence against Limerick in the round-robin game, Cork had no foothold in the middle third. He‚Äôs been outstanding in the last two games, returning to the form he showed in the league. Age: 28 Club: Charleville Debut: v Tipperary, 2017 Cork played him at centre forward for a lot of the year, but I think centre field is his best position. O‚ÄôMahony‚Äôs capacity to break up the play makes him a perfect foil and gives Fitzgibbon the freedom to attack. Had a huge game in the Munster final when Cork really needed their leaders to stand up. Age: 21 Club: Lisgoold Debut: v Clare, 2025 Did exceptionally well in the Munster final and though he‚Äôs a young player in his rookie season, there seems to be no question about his temperament. Had a quieter game against Dublin in the semi-final, but he has a very bright future. Tall, athletic, rangy with a good eye for a score. Age: 24 Club: Blarney Debut: v Dublin, 2020 Was one of the favourites for Hurler of the Year going into last year‚Äôs All-Ireland and came back to that kind of form against Limerick in the Munster final. His shooting was off against Dublin, but even on a day like that he‚Äôs always busy and asking questions. Will force Tipp to think about their options at number six. Age: 27 Club: Fr O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 After a frustrating year with injuries, he came storming back to form in the semi-final against Dublin. He also had a hugely effective semi-final last year but failed to back it up against Clare. That experience will stand to him. Takes the pressure off Patrick Horgan with long-range frees. Age: 37 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary 2008 Deserves to win an All-Ireland and maybe it will finally come on Sunday. Cork don‚Äôt depend on him nearly as much as they have over the years, which is better for everyone. Has not hit his usual percentages with dead balls but still good for a couple of scores from play. Age: 24 Club: Blackrock Debut: v Limerick, 2021 Had a spectacular match against Dublin but he doesn‚Äôt always deliver. He strikes me as a confidence player who needs the first couple of possessions to go well. If that happens, he could be electric. Always thinking about a goal and has scored five against Tipp in his last three games against them. Age: 24 Club: St Finbarr‚Äôs Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 With the biggest game of the year left, he‚Äôs my Hurler of the Year. Everything goes through him in the Cork attack, whether it‚Äôs a long puckout or a ball sent in from the middle third. His improvement over the last 14 months has been phenomenal and nothing seems to phase him. With S√©amus Harnedy not fit to start, he‚Äôs a huge option to come on. As well as him, they have plenty of experience on the bench: Shane Kingston, Conor Lehane and Damien Cahalane have all been around a long time. Pat Ryan (Manager) Donal O‚ÄôRourke, Brendan Coleman, Fergal Condon, Donal O‚ÄôMahony Pat Ryan has never looked for excuses on Cork‚Äôs bad days and he‚Äôs never blamed the players. That‚Äôs a great trait in a manager and the players will appreciate that. The way he has handled himself and the team has been hugely impressive.

Title: Remove statute of limitations to encourage churches and orders to pay sex-abuse redress - expert

In November 2022, when a tsunami of sexual abuse allegations swept into the public domain following the broadcast of the RT√â radio documentary Blackrock Boys, much of the focus was on abuse in Irish schools run by some of the religious orders. However, allegations soon emerged about similar abuse in primary and secondary schools run by the Catholic and Protestant Churches. On many grounds, not least moral, they would appear to be as obliged as the State and religious orders when it comes to contributing to compensation for people abused in their schools. Traditionally, the Irish education system has been run by the churches. Currently, 88 per cent of primary schools in Ireland are Catholic, with 5.7 per cent linked to the Church of Ireland. At second level, of 717 of 722 post-primary schools are run in association with the main churches ‚Äì 338 have a Catholic ethos, 21 are Church of Ireland, 211 are multi-denominational and 147 are inter-denominational. Of the remaining five, two are Quaker-run, while Presbyterians, Methodists and Jews run one each. All schools come within the remit of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee earlier this month. Based on previous inquiries and convictions in the courts, it is known there was sexual abuse in schools other than those run by religious congregations. Yet, recent discussion around redress seems focused entirely on contributions made, or not, by religious orders, which have been found wanting. For instance, all four religious orders involved in running Magdalene laundries refused to contribute to a redress scheme for women who spent time in those institutions. Of the eight religious congregations involved in running the Mother and Baby Homes, just two have agreed to contribute to redress for survivors. Of the approximate ‚Ç¨1.5 billion paid to survivors of residential institutions for children, about 16 per cent has come from the 18 religious congregations that ran them. According to Department of Education figures, the total adjusted offers towards redress from those orders amounted to ‚Ç¨435.53 million, with ‚Ç¨245.24 million realised. Even the controversial 2002 ‚Äúindemnity deal" entered into by the 18 religious congregation has not been fulfilled. Two properties have yet to be transferred, with ‚Ç¨124.94 million of the ‚Ç¨128 million pledged under the deal realised so far. Prof Conor O‚ÄôMahony, director of the Child Law Clinic at UCC, said one possible way of encouraging the orders and the churches to contribute to a redress scheme would be to remove a statute of limitations on survivors taking legal actions against them. ‚ÄúThen it would be in their interest to contribute to a redress scheme, as a way of reducing overall costs.‚Äù O‚ÄôMahony noted, however, that under Article 44 of the Constitution, the orders are entitled to hold on to their property. Where the State is concerned, and repeating what he wrote in this newspaper following publication of the scoping inquiry report last September, he said ‚Äúsurvivors, solicitors, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Child Law Clinic in UCC have spent a decade battling the Department of Education, seeking the full implementation of the O‚ÄôKeeffe judgment, but this has yet to happen". Louise O‚ÄôKeeffe was aged eight when she was abused at Dunderrow National School in Cork in 1973 by principal Leo Hickey. Complaints had been made against him but, in line with Department of Education policy then, these were directed to the local priest. Hickey remained at the school, perpetrating more than 400 counts of abuse against at least 20 victims. Following further allegations, he resigned and moved to another school, where he taught for a further 22 years until his retirement in 1995. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to 21 sample charges relating to the sexual abuse of girls under his care and was sentenced to three years in prison. O‚ÄôKeeffe took legal action for damages, but the courts ruled the department was not liable because the school was under Catholic Church management, even though the State paid Hickey‚Äôs salary. She appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2014 found Ireland had failed to protect O‚ÄôKeeffe from Hickey while at school. It said the State, when relinquishing control of education, should have been aware of the potential risks and put in place safeguards given its obligation to protect children. By failing to put in place adequate child-protection measures until the early 1990s at primary and second level, O‚ÄôMahony said the court found ‚Äúthe Irish State had a stand-alone culpability for breach of convention rights, independent of any other actor‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Irish government interpreted the ruling as meaning it was only liable for damages in cases where there had been a prior complaint against an abuser,‚Äù he said. O‚ÄôMahony said that while O‚ÄôKeeffe was awarded damages, it was unfortunate that the scheme was ‚Äúdesigned from its inception to make it almost impossible to receive compensation‚Äù. ‚ÄúOnly one-third of the budget of ‚Ç¨31 million allocated to the scheme was paid out. Most of the people abused by the same teacher as Louise O‚ÄôKeeffe [was] would not have qualified for payments under the scheme ‚Äì which demonstrates the bizarre logic at work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVery simply, the 2014 O‚ÄôKeeffe judgment demands that every child who experienced sexual abuse in a defective child protection framework in schools be compensated for that abuse. The Government needs to match words with action for the first time on this matter.‚Äù ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto‚Äôs Wild West Era Is Over

For more than a decade, cryptocurrency lived in a regulatory gray zone. Loved by libertarians, feared by bankers, and mocked by lawmakers, it was treated like a side project of the internet, too weird to regulate and too volatile to embrace. That era just ended. The U.S. House of Representatives has officially passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that sets federal rules for stablecoins√¢¬Ä¬îthe digital currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump, making it the first major piece of crypto legislation in American history. It is the moment crypto has been waiting for: real rules, real recognition, and real legitimacy. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are already used to move billions of dollars every day. They‚Äôre the quiet workhorses of crypto√¢¬Ä¬îused to send money across borders, trade on crypto exchanges, and settle payments instantly without touching a traditional bank. But until now, there were no federal laws clearly defining how they should work, what they must be backed by, or who should regulate them. That uncertainty scared away banks, blocked innovation, and left consumers vulnerable. The GENIUS Act changes that. It requires stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves in cash or U.S. Treasury bills. It enforces monthly disclosures. It gives consumers priority if an issuer goes bankrupt. It creates a path for both federal and state-level oversight. In short, it gives crypto the kind of legal foundation that big institutions√¢¬Ä¬îand average Americans√¢¬Ä¬îcan finally trust. This law isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt just about taming crypto. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs about launching the next era of American finance. Stablecoins are already powering instant global payments. In the future, they could be integrated into everyday apps√¢¬Ä¬îused to pay rent, send money to family, or settle business transactions in seconds. With the GENIUS Act, the U.S. is staking a claim to lead that future. At a time when countries like China are racing to launch their own state-backed digital currencies, this law sends a clear message: America won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be left behind. It also opens the door for crypto to leave the speculative Wild West and move into the financial mainstream. Companies like PayPal, Visa, and BlackRock are already building on blockchain rails. Now, they can do it with a legal framework behind them. For years, crypto has been dismissed as a sideshow. Critics called it a scam, a bubble, or a toy for rich tech bros. There was some truth to the chaos. But behind the scenes, a new financial infrastructure was being built: faster, programmable, and radically transparent. With this new law, that infrastructure gets its first real seal of approval from Washington. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not just about price anymore. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs about permanence. The GENIUS Act is just the beginning. More legislation is coming, covering digital asset securities, smart contract standards, and decentralized platforms. But this bill proves Congress can act. That alone is a major shift in the political landscape. In the next few years, you may not even realize you√¢¬Ä¬ôre using crypto. It will just be how money moves: instantly, digitally, securely. And legally. Crypto is no longer knocking on the door. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs walking in. Bitcoinpolicyregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Congress just passed its biggest crypto law ever, and Bitcoin didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt even get a mention. Once the face of financial rebellion, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs now sidelined while stablecoins take the spotlight. The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30√¢¬Ä¬îbut the rules are murky, and the government hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The world√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally. As Brussels moves to regulate AI, the Trump administration is retaliating with steep tariffs, pushing the two powers closer to an all-out trade war that could reshape the global internet.

Title: If Mamdani Sinks the Democrats, So What?

What‚Äôs wrong with New Yorkers electing Zohran Mamdani mayor? Seriously. He‚Äôs a socialist, isn‚Äôt he? He‚Äôll wreck New York City, you say. But didn‚Äôt that process start with Bill DeBlasio? Do you think that process ends electing Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams? Perennial candidate Curtis Silwa is a savior? Hasn‚Äôt socialism been the road Democrats have been traveling for decades? When Mamdani‚Äôs socialist experiment crashes and burns, maybe it‚Äôll persuade New Yorkers to abandon Democrats. Maybe independents decide to swing Republican. JFK-style liberals began vanishing after Kennedy‚Äôs assassination. Mamdani‚Äôs election would make it obvious what should be obvious. Liberalism, progressivism -- call it whatever -- is a ruse. The Democrat Party tilts full Left. Trends are making it more so. Mamdani will pursue an agenda that‚Äôs part utopian drivel, Soviet-style top-down, and plenty of Cuban incompetence leading to dysfunctional public services, higher costs, and increasing scarcity. Dead Russians and living Cubans can testify to what glorious utopia brings. A broken Democrat Party is a public necessity. Big failure means bigger brokenness. Let‚Äôs not hear nonsense from ‚Äúgood government‚Äù Republicans that a healthy two-party system profits the nation. Life isn‚Äôt a civics class. Franklin Roosevelt didn‚Äôt give a damn about anything other than healthy Democrat dominance. Jacksonian Democrats and Lincoln and McKinley Republicans believed no differently. When did Republicans go softheaded? Let dogmatic Democrats stumble in the wilderness for a generation or more. A Trumpian sea change completes in two ways: the president keeps racking up Ws and Democrats continue to misgovern, driven by extreme policies. (Senator Dave McCormick‚Äôs energy and AI summit held at Carnegie Mellon University this past week showcased more huge wins for the president. Colossal benefits are expected for the economy, regionally and nationally.) A busted Democrat party isn‚Äôt just about narrow partisan advantage. Clearing out Democrats is pivotal. MAGA is about the nation returning to its core values‚Ä¶ about building a freer, more prosperous America. Smarter Democrat operatives see their party teetering. From The Hill, July 14: ‚ÄúSadly, Democrats are still stuck in the same mud that they were in six months ago,‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. ‚ÄúWe are still as unpopular as we were when Trump was inaugurated in January.‚Äù An unnamed strategist went further, stating: ‚ÄúThis is a nightmare scenario for the Dems right now,‚Äù the strategist said. ‚ÄúWe better pray long and hard that the country is going to be in a f√¢¬Ä¬ë√¢¬Ä¬ë√¢¬Ä¬ëing depression, because I don‚Äôt know how else we find ourselves out of this mess.‚Äù Mamdani is running mask off. Give the guy credit. Indoctrinated young left-wingers proclaim socialism is the future. How many times before have we heard that? Plenty of these cultists live in the Big Apple. Posted former college professor Newt Gingrich at X, July 15: Mamdani‚Äôs supporters are not the well educated young the media describes. They are the well brainwashed young. The more elite the school you went to the more likely you are to be brainwashed rather than educated. They could vote for Mamdani to turn New York City into Caracas and they would have no idea how much damage they will have done. As Mark Twain said ‚ÄúIt ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.‚Äù Welcome to Mandani land[.] Newt, these young are social inbreds.

Image: AT via Magic Studio What‚Äôs wrong with New Yorkers electing Zohran Mamdani mayor? Seriously. He‚Äôs a socialist, isn‚Äôt he? He‚Äôll wreck New York City, you say. But didn‚Äôt that process start with Bill DeBlasio? Do you think that process ends electing Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams? Perennial candidate Curtis Silwa is a savior? Hasn‚Äôt socialism been the road Democrats have been traveling for decades? When Mamdani‚Äôs socialist experiment crashes and burns, maybe it‚Äôll persuade New Yorkers to abandon Democrats. Maybe independents decide to swing Republican. JFK-style liberals began vanishing after Kennedy‚Äôs assassination. Mamdani‚Äôs election would make it obvious what should be obvious. Liberalism, progressivism -- call it whatever -- is a ruse. The Democrat Party tilts full Left. Trends are making it more so. Mamdani will pursue an agenda that‚Äôs part utopian drivel, Soviet-style top-down, and plenty of Cuban incompetence leading to dysfunctional public services, higher costs, and increasing scarcity. Dead Russians and living Cubans can testify to what glorious utopia brings. A broken Democrat Party is a public necessity. Big failure means bigger brokenness. Let‚Äôs not hear nonsense from ‚Äúgood government‚Äù Republicans that a healthy two-party system profits the nation. Life isn‚Äôt a civics class. Franklin Roosevelt didn‚Äôt give a damn about anything other than healthy Democrat dominance. Jacksonian Democrats and Lincoln and McKinley Republicans believed no differently. When did Republicans go softheaded? Let dogmatic Democrats stumble in the wilderness for a generation or more. A Trumpian sea change completes in two ways: the president keeps racking up Ws and Democrats continue to misgovern, driven by extreme policies. (Senator Dave McCormick‚Äôs energy and AI summit held at Carnegie Mellon University this past week showcased more huge wins for the president. Colossal benefits are expected for the economy, regionally and nationally.) A busted Democrat party isn‚Äôt just about narrow partisan advantage. Clearing out Democrats is pivotal. MAGA is about the nation returning to its core values‚Ä¶ about building a freer, more prosperous America. Smarter Democrat operatives see their party teetering. From The Hill, July 14: ‚ÄúSadly, Democrats are still stuck in the same mud that they were in six months ago,‚Äù Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. ‚ÄúWe are still as unpopular as we were when Trump was inaugurated in January.‚Äù An unnamed strategist went further, stating: ‚ÄúThis is a nightmare scenario for the Dems right now,‚Äù the strategist said. ‚ÄúWe better pray long and hard that the country is going to be in a f√¢¬Ä¬ë√¢¬Ä¬ë√¢¬Ä¬ëing depression, because I don‚Äôt know how else we find ourselves out of this mess.‚Äù Mamdani is running mask off. Give the guy credit. Indoctrinated young left-wingers proclaim socialism is the future. How many times before have we heard that? Plenty of these cultists live in the Big Apple. Posted former college professor Newt Gingrich at X, July 15: Mamdani‚Äôs supporters are not the well educated young the media describes. They are the well brainwashed young. The more elite the school you went to the more likely you are to be brainwashed rather than educated. They could vote for Mamdani to turn New York City into Caracas and they would have no idea how much damage they will have done. As Mark Twain said ‚ÄúIt ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.‚Äù Welcome to Mandani land[.] Newt, these young are social inbreds. Their parents‚Äô money has insulated them from life‚Äôs grittier realities. U.S. history has been spoon-fed to them by radical leftist teachers and professors. America is evil.

Title: Anti-DEI Shareholder Proposals Are Failing, But Not Because Of Politics
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/07/17/anti-dei-shareholder-proposals-are-failing-but-not-because-of-politics/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T23:46:18Z
Full Content:
ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order to appoint Chris ... More Rocheleau as the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump also signed a memorandum ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety and ordering an elevation of what he called ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù over ‚ÄúD.E.I.‚Äù (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Shareholders are overwhelmingly voting down proposals to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at top companies. The rejection of anti-DEI proposals is emboldening advocates who view it as a clear statement by investors that they are rejecting conservative policies and as an admonishment of President Trump. However, the rejections were not about politics, rather about the process and nature of the shareholder votes. Simply, the proposals were doomed to fail. Republicans in the U.S. have taken a strong stance against DEI programs, calling them discriminatory. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Justice has made it clear they view DEI programs as illegal and will be using the office to prosecute violators, stating the ‚ÄúDepartment of Justice‚Äôs Civil Rights Division will investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector‚Ä¶‚Äù This creates a clear threat of legal liability against companies wishing to engage in DEI practices. Conservative groups are also taking the issue directly to companies During the 2025 proxy season, the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, submitted the majority of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals in 2025. The proposals referenced a series of cases, including Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that ruled race-based admissions are unconstitutional. As I noted in 2023, the Court‚Äôs opinion was a major blow to ESG and DEI, even though it did not directly address those issues in the corporate world. Other cases and the actions by the DOJ are connecting DEI as illegal discrimination. While there may be legal merits to some of NCPPR‚Äôs arguments, the format of the shareholder proposal made passage nearly impossible. This has caused confusion as to the intent of corporate management versus their actions, causing activists to find false hope. However, a look at the type of proposals provides needed context. Proposals submitted to the shareholders for approval come in the form of management proposals and shareholder proposals. Management proposals originate from the board of directors of the company. They have been vetted and worked through a clear process. As a result, those tend to have a high passage rate. Shareholder proposals originate from individuals or organizations that own shares in the company. Each company has its own process for how a shareholder can introduce a proposal for approval by the shareholders. Typically, shareholder proposals are only a small fraction of the total proposals. Shareholder proposals also have a much lower passage rate. According a BlackRock report, only 867 shareholder proposals were voted on in the 2023 - 2024 proxy year, compared to 168,400 management proposals. During that year, BlackRock only voted in favor of 99 of the shareholder proposals, approximately 11.4% of them. This has been consistent as BlackRock states they generally follow management for the direction of a company, while shareholder proposals tend to be in conflict with management proposals. A study by Cooley of the 2025 proxy season showed similar results, stating that 3000 companies received 830 shareholder proposals in the 2025 proxy year. Looking at overall support, not passage rate, shareholder proposals relating to governance issues only received 35% support, environmental proposals received 13% support, and social proposals received 12% support. No DEI proposals passed, either in support or in opposition of the programs. The lack of support for shareholder proposals is institutional and driven by the large financial management companies, like BlackRock, that tend to support management proposals at a much higher rate, while overwhelming rejecting shareholder proposals. This has led to confusion of policies as people attach meaning to the vote that is not tied to the stated rationale. This misunderstanding of the shareholder proposal votes is not new. I wrote about this issue in August 2024, when BlackRock was accused of pulling support of ESG. The accusations were based on BlackRock‚Äôs votes against shareholder proposals that called for a larger focus on ESG. In BlackRock‚Äôs 2024 Global Voting Spotlight, released in August 2024, the company stated ‚Äúour analysis indicates that a relatively small number of shareholder proponents and advocacy groups filed the majority of proposals at U.S.-based companies ‚Äì with fewer than 10 filing approximately 80% of proposals in the 2023-24 proxy year. Based on our review of proxy materials, these proponents often filed similar proposals at multiple companies, regardless of the specifics of their sectors or business models.‚Äù The BlackRock report also stated, ‚Äúwe still observed many poor-quality proposals come to a vote, particularly on proposals that attempted to address climate and natural capital or company impacts on people-related issues. Consistent with last year, we found the majority of proposals addressing these topics were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value. A significant percentage were focused on business risks that companies already had processes in place to address, making them redundant.‚Äù The same rationale was offered in opposition of the anti-DEI proposals. In response to a proposal made to Apply by NCPPR, management stated the proposal ‚Äúis unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program. The proposal also inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple‚Äôs ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.‚Äù Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods offered a similar response, stating ‚Äúwe already have well established compliance and risk oversight programs and processes‚Ä¶‚Äù Others used similar language. The argument by management is simply that this is an issue that should not be adopted by shareholders. Instead, it is a risk and compliance issue that should be addressed by management. As the legal landscape changes, the company needs to be able to adapt without the confines of a shareholder vote. While DEI advocates will use the failure of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals as a sign that the tide is shifting against Trump, the data shows that is is just business as usual.

Title: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit Record $726M‚ÄîBlackRock Alone Drew $500M

Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have just seen their biggest day of inflows, driven largely by demand on BlackRock and Fidelity. According to data from Farside Investors, July 16th was a big day for the US Ethereum spot ETFs, with total inflows crossing the $726 million mark, a new all-time high (ATH). The spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this means that ETF holders don‚Äôt have to manage digital asset wallets or navigate exchanges. For traditional investors, this fact can make spot ETFs a convenient way to explore the market. Ethereum spot ETFs gained approval in the US nearly one year ago. Since then, demand has varied, but the asset has lately been on a positive run of inflows, with the most recent numbers showing momentum is only accelerating. Below is a table that shows how the netflow related to the various Ethereum spot ETFs has looked during the last couple of weeks. As is visible, notable daily inflows of around $200 million or more were already happening into the US Ethereum spot ETFs during the past week, indicating that demand from institutional entities was solid, but with the latest record-breaking day, things have clearly kicked into an even higher gear. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA saw the largest share of July 16th inflows at almost $500 million. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH was a distant second, purchasing about $133 million in the cryptocurrency on behalf of its users.Capital has poured into the spot ETFs as Ethereum has seen a breakout above the $3,000 level, which has so far brought it to $3,400 for the first time since January. Following this rally, institutional investors aren‚Äôt the only ones paying attention to ETH, as data from the analytics firm Santiment shows a spike in retail interest. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the Social Dominance, an indicator that tells us about the discussion share that Ethereum occupies on the major social media platforms relative to other cryptocurrencies. Since retail investors far outweigh the larger holders in terms of numbers, this metric ends up reflecting the behavior of the small hands. From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that the ETH Social Dominance has seen a huge spike alongside the price surge, with 13.4% of all digital asset discussions on social media now involving the coin. Clearly, retail is taking note of the asset now, but historically, overhype among the crowd is something that has tended not to end well for cryptocurrencies, so this trend could be one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,400, up more than 23% over the last week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Here are the latest news items and commentary on current economics news, market trends, stocks, investing opportunities, and the precious metals markets. In this column, JWR also covers hedges, derivatives, and various obscura. This column emphasizes JWR‚Äôs ‚Äútangibles heavy‚Äù investing strategy and contrarian perspective. Today, we look at the LMBA‚Äôs nascent silver short squeeze. (See the Precious Metals section.) The Comex shorts did their best to hold down the price of silver again this week. But the Asian traders kept bidding it back up into the $38.20 to $38.50 USD range. The word is out that the LBMA has nearly exhausted its supply of physically warehoused silver available for delivery. The exchange now holds less than 160 million physical ounces. Keep in mind that more than 200 million ounces worth of silver contracts are cleared there, daily. But most of those are ‚Äúpaper for paper‚Äù transactions ‚Äî not physical deliveries. What happens if and when more buyers start to demand delivery? This could get ugly. (For the Shorts, that is. Not for us silver stackers. We are now sitting pretty.) ‚Äì JWR o o o At Gold-Eagle.com: The Key Breakout for Many Markets Including Gold. o o o Scottsdale Mint: US Metal War: Silver Becomes Strategic as Premiums Explode.

Title: Trump Prepares To Allow Crypto Investments In $9 Trillion Retirement Market

President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to open the $9 trillion retirement market to a range of alternative investments, including crypto, gold, and private equity. According to the Financial Times, this initiative is expected to be formalized through an executive order as early as this week. It seeks to diversify the investment options available within 401(k) plans, which have traditionally been limited to stocks and bonds. Trump‚Äôs forthcoming executive order will direct regulatory agencies to explore the necessary adjustments to facilitate the inclusion of these alternative asset classes in professionally managed retirement funds. According to insiders familiar with the plan, this shift aims to enable American workers to invest their retirement savings in a broader spectrum of opportunities, including digital assets, metals, and funds that focus on private loans and corporate takeovers. This executive order marks a significant acceleration in Trump‚Äôs efforts to mainstream cryptocurrency investments. His administration has already taken steps to ease regulatory burdens, notably by reversing a Biden-era policy that discouraged the inclusion of crypto options in retirement accounts. The recent passage of three crypto-related bills by the House, which Trump has vocally supported, further underscores his commitment to bolster the digital asset industry. The implications of opening the retirement market to private equity are vast. Major capital groups, including Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, have expressed keen interest in gaining access to 401(k) funds, which they view as a potential source of hundreds of billions in new assets. However, the push to integrate less liquid private investments into retirement plans carries inherent risks. Higher fees and reduced transparency regarding asset valuations may pose challenges for plan administrators and investors alike.

Adding staking functionality to the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) would allow the product, which debuted last July, to earn yield by using the held ETH to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, according to the 19b-4 proposal. Multiple issuers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and 21Shares, are also seeking to include staking in their funds. The SEC is due to issue decisions in October on similar requests for staking submitted by Cboe and the NYSE. It has an April deadline to weigh in on ETHA, although Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote in an X post Thursday that he doubted "it will take that long for a potential approval." "We think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25," Seyffart also wrote. Staking is not ‚Äúdone‚Äù. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won‚Äôt have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25) https://t.co/QWn9L2DVPA ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 17, 2025 The feature has been controversial, with proponents saying it would increase returns while critics raise concerns about security vulnerabilities and market manipulation. Prospectuses for ETHA and the other eight Ethereum funds currently trading indicated that the products would not include staking, but the 19b-4 filing proposes deletes that passage and proposes new language allowing for it. "In consideration for any staking activity in which the Trust may engage, the Trust would receive all or a portion of the staking rewards generated by the staking provider, which may be treated as income to the Trust," the new language states. BlackRock's Ethereum fund has been the most successful in this category, generating more than $7 billion in net inflows, more than double the total of any other, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. It was recently trading at just below $26, up nearly 1% as of the close of trading Thursday. Ethereum ETFs have been surging in recent weeks, adding more than $2.2 billion in net investments over a nine-day streak. On Wednesday, they hit a record daily high with $726.6 million in inflows, including nearly $500 million from ETHA alone.

Title: Ethereum: Is this the start of a 2017-style ETH rally? ‚Äì Data suggests‚Ä¶

Ethereum rallies 8%, with institutional buys boosting momentum. Could ETH mirror its 2017 breakout to $6,200? Ethereum was setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. With the dwindling supply of ETH on CEXs at 13.4% lower than that of Bitcoin, a rally could be imminent. Can institutions make this happen? Ethereum [ETH] was trading at $3,435 at the time of writing, with the altcoin up about 8% in the last 24 hours. The daily trading volume was about $52M at the time of writing, about $20M short of what Bitcoin [BTC] had. As the altcoin continues to rally, analysts are betting on it to repeat previous successes. Can Ethereum do it? Analyst Mister Crypto on X, formerly Twitter, predicted that a rally for ETH was coming. The prediction came from the analysis that showed Ethereum could repeat its 2017 pattern. Mister Crypto‚Äôs prediction suggested that ETH could surpass $6,200, which would coincide with the high of $385 in 2017. His tweet read; ‚ÄúETH is setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. If history repeats, a massive rally is imminent here!‚Äù Looking at the current price action, the chart confirms the potential outlook. Price had consolidated since mid-June to mid-July but had swept liquidity on both sides with false breakouts. Meanwhile, the volume bars were increasing as ETH pumped higher. Source: TradingView Ethereum‚Äôs continued price rise is boosting confidence that it could mirror its 2017 breakout. Analysts and institutions are closely watching the altcoin, with deeper research revealing they‚Äôre actively contributing to the rally‚Äôs momentum. BlackRock has added 159,101 ETH worth $499 million, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to 2.021 million ETH, valued at approximately $7 billion. This sizable accumulation places BlackRock firmly on the radar of Ethereum‚Äôs potential rally. Source: Whale Insider/X Still, Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Finance (WLFi) joined this purchase trail. While backing this potential surge, Ted Pillows reported that WLFi bought $4.99M worth of ETH. Ted Pillows also backed the bullishness, saying; ‚ÄúThis is the worst time to be bearish on Ethereum.‚Äù WLFi added another batch of ETH, bringing its total purchases for the day to $10 million. Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming acquired 10,850 ETH, pushing its total Ethereum holdings to $1.03 billion. Combined, these moves raised the total ETH held in strategic reserves to 1.6 million ETH. This buying spree coincided with signs of a looming Ethereum supply crunch. According to Glassnode, ETH‚Äôs supply on exchanges dropped to 13.4%, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 14.5%, indicating stronger demand for Ethereum. If this trend continues, Ethereum could be on track to mirror its explosive 2017 rally. Source: Glassnode Ethereum‚Äôs shrinking supply is partly due to its growing staking market cap, which continues to climb. This trend may accelerate as banks increasingly choose Ethereum as the foundation for deploying their stablecoins, boosting demand even further.

Title: BlackRock moves to add staking to Ethereum ETF amid surge in inflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-moves-to-add-staking-to-ethereum-etf-amid-surge-in-inflows/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T19:45:03Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has filed to incorporate staking into its iShares Ethereum Trust (ticker: ETHA), the largest Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by assets under management. The move, disclosed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, follows growing institutional interest in Ethereum staking products and comes amid record-breaking net inflows into ETH ETFs. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq under SEC Rule 19b-4, which national securities exchanges follow to propose new fund structures. BlackRock is the latest asset manager to pursue staking capabilities for its Ethereum fund, joining a competitive field that includes Grayscale, 21Shares, and others with similar proposals already in the pipeline. BlackRock‚Äôs filing outlines that the trust may stake ‚Äúall or a portion‚Äù of its ETH holdings through one or more trusted staking providers. The proposal specifies that the ether held by the trust will not be pooled with other entities, nor will the trust assume risk on behalf of others from slashing or network forks. Coinbase, currently acting as custodian and prime execution agent for ETHA, is expected to serve as the fund‚Äôs staking partner. The filing comes at a moment of surging interest in Ethereum investment products. On Wednesday, ETH ETFs recorded their highest single-day net inflow since launch, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA accounting for $499 million of that sum. So far in July, ETH ETFs have attracted over $2.27 billion in net inflows, marking the strongest monthly inflow to date, according to data from SoSoValue. ETHA was approved in July 2024, as part of a group of spot Ethereum ETFs greenlit by the SEC shortly after it approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. ETHA currently holds over $7.9 billion in assets, underscoring BlackRock‚Äôs leadership position in Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. BlackRock‚Äôs Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, has previously signaled that staking would be the ‚Äúnext phase‚Äù for crypto ETFs. Thursday‚Äôs filing appears to make that vision concrete, at a time when regulatory momentum and investor interest are aligning. BlackRock‚Äôs move comes shortly after the SEC approved the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, the first US-based staking ETF, earlier this month. That product was approved under the more stringent Securities Exchange Act of 1940. In contrast, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA staking proposal falls under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, under which no staking ETF has yet been approved. However, SEC officials have indicated growing openness to staking ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X (formerly Twitter) that ‚Äústaking is not done,‚Äù predicting that approval for Ethereum staking ETFs may arrive as early as Q4 2025. While BlackRock‚Äôs latest filing may not receive a final decision until around April 2026, the broader outlook for staking products appears favorable. As Ethereum‚Äôs price hovers near $3,399‚Äîstill below its 2021 all-time high of $4,878‚Äîthe prospect of yield-generating, regulated staking products could further fuel institutional adoption. With competitors also eyeing staking ETFs for assets like Cronos, Tron, and Injective, BlackRock‚Äôs move signals an increasingly diverse crypto ETF landscape taking shape.

Canary Capital's staked Injective ETF aims to grant investors regulated on-chain yield access amid the evolving regulatory landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Canary Capital has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the first-ever staked Injective (INJ) exchange-traded fund, aiming to provide institutional investors with regulated access to native on-chain yield. The proposed Canary Staked INJ ETF would actively stake its INJ holdings on the Injective proof-of-stake network, passing staking rewards, currently estimated at 10% to 12% annually, directly to shareholders. It also signals growing market confidence in Injective‚Äôs ecosystem, which has attracted strategic backing from firms like Google Cloud and T-Mobile. Injective Labs is also actively engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. regulators to define compliant pathways for decentralized finance. The INJ ETF is part of a larger push by Canary Capital, a firm led by former Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg, to bring high-yield digital assets into traditional market structures. Canary has already filed for ETFs tied to Solana, XRP, Hedera, Sui, and the Pudgy Penguins NFT project. Several of these applications include staking components, such as its Marinade-powered Solana ETF, positioning the firm as a leader in staking-integrated investment products. Canary established a Delaware statutory trust to support the INJ fund, mirroring its previous filings and signaling intent to meet the SEC‚Äôs evolving expectations around custodianship, validator selection, and yield treatment. The proposal lands during Crypto Week 2025, as lawmakers debate multiple bills that could define the legal framework for staking and other crypto-native activities. With SEC leadership now more open to structured yield products, Canary‚Äôs timing reflects a calculated bet on a regulatory shift. Several issuers are looking to include staking in upcoming ETFs. Some have also filed to activate staking for spot Ethereum ETFs that are already live, including BlackRock.

Title: Nasdaq applies to include staking in BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF as SEC weighs broader industry requests
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/nasdaq-applies-to-include-staking-in-blackrocks-ethereum-etf-as-sec-weighs-broader-industry-requests/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T18:46:06Z

BlackRock now joins a list of similar requests from issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21shares. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The rule change would add a detailed ‚Äústaking‚Äù section permitting BlackRock to stake Ethereum (ETH) directly or through one or more trusted staking providers. BlackRock would treat received rewards as income, and the firm must hold the staked coins in arrangements consistent with a May statement by the SEC Division of Corporation Finance on certain protocol staking activities. Notably, the asset manager must also obtain either a counsel opinion or US government guidance on federal tax treatment before it starts. Furthermore, in the event of slashing or forking, BlackRock will not subsidize or absorb incoming losses. Nasdaq stated that its proposal would enable ETHA to capture returns while operating under defined constraints intended to protect shareholders and the market. BlackRock joins a queue of issuers that have asked regulators to let their US-based spot Ethereum products earn protocol rewards. Cboe seeks authority for Fidelity‚Äôs FETH, Franklin Templeton‚Äôs EZET, Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs QETH, and 21shares‚Äô CETH. On NYSE Arca, Bitwise seeks approval to stake the ETH held in its ETHW. At the same time, Grayscale seeks the same approval for its ETHE and mini trust. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reacted to the Nasdaq submission on X, saying it was ‚Äúabout time.‚Äù The first final deadline for prior filings is in October, while the deadline for Nasdaq‚Äôs filing on BlackRock‚Äôs ETF is in early April. However, Seyffart believes it is unlikely for the SEC approval to take that long. US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $726 million in net inflows across nine funds on July 16, marking a daily record. ETHA led allocations with $499.2 million, marking a record for daily inflows into the fund, representing nearly 69% of the total. The heavy inflows may indicate that institutional investors are betting on Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals, such as its infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenized assets.

Title: BlackRock, Nasdaq seek SEC approval to add staking to BlackRock‚Äôs spot Ether ETF
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/staking-spot-ether-etf/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:45:26Z
Full Content:
Share this article Nasdaq has proposed a rule change with the SEC to enable staking capabilities for BlackRock‚Äôs spot Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, also known as ETHA. According to a new 19b-4 filing, the fund would be able to stake all or a portion of ETHA‚Äôs Ether through one or more trusted staking providers if granted approval by the securities regulator. The proposal also indicates that staking rewards would be treated as income. With this move, BlackRock officially joins a number of fund managers pursuing permission to incorporate staking into their Ethereum funds. These include 21Shares, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Cboe BZX Exchange filed, on behalf of 21Shares, to seek comments regarding permitting the staking of Ether held by the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the filing in February. In March, the exchange filed a proposal to enable staking for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET). NYSE Arca submitted a proposal on behalf of Grayscale to enable Ethereum staking within its ETFs, specifically the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Before the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, industry leaders such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco/Galaxy had sought to offer staking as part of their Ethereum ETFs. This feature would have allowed fund managers to stake the underlying Ethereum holdings, generating additional yields for investors through the Ethereum network‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. However, the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, raised concerns that staking-as-a-service offerings could be classified as unregistered securities. The regulator previously targeted firms offering staking services, like Coinbase and Kraken. In response to the SEC‚Äôs position, these firms amended their Ethereum ETF applications and removed the staking provisions. The removal of staking capabilities was speculated to influence ARK Invest‚Äôs decision to withdraw its Ethereum ETF plans. Without staking, the ETFs would only track Ether‚Äôs price, excluding the approximately 3% yield available through staking rewards. This makes the product less attractive to investors seeking growth in their holdings through staking rewards. Share this article Sign in to your account Don‚Äôt have an account?
