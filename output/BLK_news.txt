Hyperinflation from unchecked money printing (like Weimar Germany) or a deflationary debt spiral causing mass defaultsâboth threatening the U.S. dollarâs stability. A global elite scheme to confiscate wealth via centralized controls, including CBDCs that could restrict spending and freeze dissentersâ funds under the guise of "stability." BlackRock and others are hedging with Bitcoin, while stablecoins (e.g., Tether) and privacy coins (Monero, Zcash) may become lifelines if traditional banking collapses. Exit fiatâhold self-custodied Bitcoin, precious metals, and use decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Secure off-grid essentials (food, water, energy) before financial controls tighten. June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rolloutâurging immediate action to decentralize assets.

June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rolloutâurging immediate action to decentralize assets. In a chilling warning on Decentralized TV, investment strategist Chris Sullivan outlined two catastrophic economic collapse scenariosâhyperinflation from unchecked money printing or a deflationary spiral triggering mass debt defaults. His most alarming revelation? The looming threat of the "Great Taking"âa global elite scheme to confiscate wealth through centralized financial controls. Sullivan, a seasoned financial expert with decades of experience, urged viewers to "exit fiatânow" and embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, including Bitcoin, privacy coins, and precious metals. His insights reveal that institutional investors are already hedging against systemic failure by quietly moving into crypto, while stablecoins like Tether could become lifelines if traditional banking collapses. The Two Economic Doomsday Scenarios Sullivan warned that the U.S. dollar system faces two potential death spirals: Hyperinflation â The Federal Reserveâs endless money printing could render the dollar worthless, mirroring Weimar Germany or modern-day Venezuela. Deflationary Collapse â A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isnât going to even know theyâre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional bankingâwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" â A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assetsâhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, youâve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoptionâeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivanâs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivanâs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out.

June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out. Watch the full episode of the "Decentralized TV" with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, Todd Pitner and Chris Sullivan as they talk about Deflation vs. Hyperinflation.

His advice? Self-custody assetsâhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, youâve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoptionâeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivanâs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms.

Title: Why is China angry about a plan to sell two ports on the Panama Canal?

Beijing’s displeasure over conglomerate’s plans highlights tightening business environment in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison, one of the largest conglomerates in Hong Kong, earlier this month announced plans to sell its stake in two ports on the Panama Canal to a group of US investors led by BlackRock. The plan, part of a $22.8bn megadeal that would grant the consortium control over more than 40 ports in 23 countries, followed complaints by United States President Donald Trump that the key shipping route was under Chinese control. CK Hutchison shares soared following news of the deal on March 4, but plunged less than two weeks later when Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-run newspaper in Hong Kong, accused the company in two op-eds of “spineless grovelling” and cutting a deal “that betrayed and sold out all Chinese people”. With an April 2 deadline to sign the deal looming, CK Hutchison is now in the crosshairs of both Washington and Beijing. Why would China want to stop the deal? Editorials in Ta Kung Pao, which is controlled by Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong through a subsidiary, are often read as signals from the upper ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kong leader John Lee, who was elected as the sole candidate in an election tightly controlled by Beijing, has criticised the CK Hutchison deal, saying it deserves “serious attention”. The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. On Friday, China’s market regulator said on its official WeChat account that it would carry out an antitrust investigation “in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. Following the news, local media, including the Sing Tao Daily and the South China Morning Post, reported that CK Hutchison would not go forward with the deal this week. What is Beijing’s relationship with CK Hutchison? The proposed sale has also highlighted longstanding tensions between Beijing and CK Hutchison and its 96-year-old billionaire founder, Li Ka-shing. Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. In 2015, Li raised eyebrows when he restructured his business interests and registered them in the Cayman Islands. Around this time, he also began to divest from China. In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. While analysts have offered differing opinions on whether the Li family tacitly supported calls for democracy in Hong Kong, there is broad agreement that it is less visibly pro-Beijing than many of the city’s other business dynasties. “Compared to other family offices of his generation – such as the Fok and Pao family, who invested in the mainland as early as the 1980s, or the Tung family, who are active in Sino-American relations and Hong Kong governance – Li and his sons position themselves as businesspeople who invest globally and distance themselves from politics,” Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute, told Al Jazeera. Can Beijing stop the sale from going ahead? Chan said Beijing is relatively constrained in terms of formal regulatory authority to stop the deal. “In strict legal terms, it will be quite difficult for Beijing and Hong Kong to call off the deal, given the companies and the ports involved are not ‘legally’ located within the jurisdiction of China and Hong Kong,” he said. Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong barrister and member of the city’s Executive Council, said the antitrust investigation could be seen as a “deterrent” against CK Hutchison moving forward with the deal. Tong said Chinese regulators typically do not step in to block Hong Kong business deals, but are within their rights to investigate. “If people carry on their business activities contrary to the law, they ought to be investigated to see whether they have fallen afoul of the law,” Tong told Al Jazeera. Experts quoted in the South China Morning Post said that Chinese regulators could claim legal jurisdiction over the deal by arguing that BlackRock’s acquisition of so many ports would give them a monopoly over regional trade routes. Proving that the deal would have an adverse impact on competition, however, could be more difficult, while invoking national security concerns could be challenging as BlackRock is a private company, the experts quoted by the Post said. Martina Fuchs, a business correspondent for the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, said she expects the deal to be delayed or called off as it has become “highly politicised.” “China’s criticism of CK Hutchison’s move to sell the ports business also reflects its strategic interests in the region on the one hand side, and the growing pressure from US President Donald Trump to curb China’s influence as well as worries about national security on the other,” Fuchs told Al Jazeera. “CK Hutchison being thrust into the crosshairs in the midst of the once-again escalating China-US trade war reflects how both powers are battling for control of the strategic waterway,” she said. What other pressure can Beijing apply? Even without going through formal legal channels, Beijing could apply pressure in other ways. CK Hutchison’s affiliate companies and business interests in the mainland are a point of vulnerability, according to an analyst who covers China’s economy, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of the issue. While CK Hutchison has wound down its investment in China, it still earns about 12 percent of its revenue from China – representing more than $300m in 2024. Its sister company, CK Asset Holdings, still owns dozens of properties in mainland China, which means it is also very exposed to Beijing, the analyst said. Foreign and local companies in Hong Kong will be closely watching to see what happens next, he said. “The wider Li family group of companies still has a meaningful amount of assets on the mainland, such as CK Asset’s property holdings. They are almost certainly aware that they could be exposed to retaliation from Beijing,” the analyst said. Kevin Yam, a lawyer who specialised in financial services and commercial litigation until he left Hong Kong in 2022, said Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma. After criticising China’s regulators in 2020, Ma was forced to cancel the IPO of Ant Financial, a financial subsidiary of Alibaba. Since then, he has only rarely been seen in public. “Hong Kong being Hong Kong, chances are they won’t cut the Li family down to size to the same extent as they did to Jack Ma, but I reckon ultimately whichever way this thing is going to go … it won’t be directly about the deal,” Yam, who is wanted by Hong Kong police over his participation in the 2019 protests, told Al Jazeera. Beijing has not shied away from using extrajudicial methods against prominent citizens in the past. In 2017, Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua – then one of China’s wealthiest people – vanished from the luxury hotel where he was living in Hong Kong, with multiple media outlets reporting that he had been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. Xiao’s exact whereabouts remained unknown for five years until 2022, when a Shanghai court sentenced the tycoon to 13 years imprisonment for allegedly embezzling $8bn. In 2023, Bao Fan, an influential Chinese tech banker, went incommunicado amid a crackdown on the financial services industry. Bao, whose firm announced his resignation last year, has not been publicly heard from since. What’s next for the CK Hutchison deal? With just a day to go until the April 2 deadline, the fate of the sale is unclear. While Chinese regulators are looking into the deal, the Hong Kong government has yet to investigate, according to Tong, who sits on the cabinet of Hong Kong’s chief executive. On the Chinese mainland, the government appears to be making use of both the carrot and the stick. Last week, Li’s son Richard was invited to the China Development Forum, a high-profile business summit held annually in Beijing. While Richard is not involved in the management of CK Hutchison, the markets interpreted his invitation as a positive sign for the company’s relations with Beijing, sending its shares 3.4 percent higher last Monday. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg reported that Beijing had issued a directive to state-owned enterprises to hold off on new business with CK Hutchison and its affiliates, citing people familiar with the matter. While it is still uncertain whether CK Hutchison and BlackRock will go ahead with the deal, a delay would not necessarily stop it in its tracks. The deal reportedly includes a 145-day exclusivity clause for negotiations, after which time CK Hutchison would be free to sell its assets to another party, according to the Post. The Post said neither party had revealed “the start or end” of the exclusivity period. Tong said it was difficult to say more without official word from CK Hutchison or BlackRock. “Very few facts are known to the public,” he said. “[CK Hutchison] is keeping mum, saying nothing at all, so people can only venture to guess what is happening.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: BlackRock, at centre of Panama ports deal, has nearly US$16 billion in Chinese stocks

SHANGHAI — BlackRock, the asset manager at the centre of a deal to buy US$23 billion in port assets from Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings, has about $15.5 billion invested in Hong Kong and mainland-listed stocks through its China-focused funds, with its portfolios concentrated on technology and financial companies. According to its website, the world's largest money manager has at least seven funds dedicated to Chinese stocks; five are passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and two are actively managed. The funds' top holdings as of the end of February included Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and China Merchants Bank, according to fact sheets. Alibaba owns the Post. The largest is the $7.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, which tracks the FTSE China 50 Index. The iShares MSCI China ETF, which tracks the MSCI China Index, ranked second with $6.3 billion in assets. The BlackRock China Fund is the larger of the two actively invested funds, with $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The BlackRock China A Opportunities Fund, which targets yuan-denominated stocks in mainland China, had $15.7 million in AUM. BlackRock also manages other funds with regional or global scopes that may also be invested in Chinese equities. Earlier in March, CK Hutchison said it would sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock for US$23 billion. The deal triggered a backlash and on Friday, Beijing said it would launch an antitrust probe into the sale. US President Donald Trump, who had lobbied for the canal to be freed from what he called Chinese control, hailed the deal, amid trade-based tensions between Beijing and Washington. The New York-based asset manager did not reply to an email from the Post seeking comment. A BlackRock building is seen in New York, the United States. (File photo: Reuters) At the end of 2023, BlackRock had AUM of US$10 trillion with US$5.3 trillion invested in stocks worldwide, according to its latest annual report. The firm's iShares China Large-Cap ETF is up 18% this year and its iShares MSCI China ETF has risen 16%. Both have benefited from a stock market rally triggered by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's release of two powerful but cost-effective large language models. The BlackRock China Fund, managed by Lucy Liu and Ada Zhang, has gained 14% so far this year. Tencent was the fund's top holding, accounting for 9.2% of its assets, followed by Alibaba at 8.5% and Xiaomi at 6.5%. The firm's China A Opportunities Fund has underperformed with a 3.2% rise this year, though it bested a 1.2% loss for the CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks over the same period. Its top three holdings were EV battery maker CATL, China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance. As of March 17, BlackRock funds held a combined 984.8 million shares of Alibaba, representing a 5.2% stake, according to data from Hong Kong's stock exchange. It also held 47.4 million Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE, a maker of telecoms equipment, representing a stake of 6.2%. BlackRock also recently held a 5.09% stake in CK Hutchison. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has said after his meetings with global financial leaders, investors were saying they would increase their exposure to Chinese stocks. And global investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised their targets for major China stock indices this year, citing appealing valuations and the positive impact on earnings from DeepSeek's breakthrough. For its part, BlackRock has said it was cautious about the outlook for Chinese stocks. "We are modestly overweight," the BlackRock Investment Institute said in its latest weekly commentary on March 24. "We think AI and tech excitement could keep driving returns, potentially reducing the odds of much-anticipated government stimulus. We stand ready to pivot. We remain cautious given structural challenges to China's growth and tariff risks."

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a "predictable” business environment, China’s market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing’s deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to "protect public interests.” Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing Li's CK Hutchison Holdings of acting "in concert with U.S. hegemony” over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the U.S. president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock as America "reclaiming” the famed waterway.

Title: Less than half of Irish workers feel ready for ‘comfortable retirement’, survey shows

Many families are still feeling the affects of the cost-of-living crisis.. Stock image A new survey has found that less than half of Irish workers believe that they can live a comfortable life after retirement. Financial advisers BlackRock surveyed 400 workers in Ireland, 300 of whom participate in Defined Contribution (DC) schemes – workplace plans where both employer and employee contribute a certain amount. “The 2025 survey highlights the importance of pensions in securing a comfortable retirement,” said Tim Hodgson, head of DC platforms and retirement solutions at BlackRock. “Retirement readiness remains a significant concern for many workers, with less than half (41pc) of survey participants feeling on-track for a reasonable standard of living in retirement. “This concern is particularly acute among those without DC workplace pensions, with only 26pc feeling prepared.” Next September, Irish workers who are not already enrolled in a pension plan will be automatically added to the My Future Fund or the auto-enrolment plan. Under the scheme, employees aged between 23 and 60 earning above €20,000 will be automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, unless they decide to opt out of it after six months. While participants showed interest in the scheme, the survey noted that there was a lack of understanding about the new pension plan and concerns about its affordability. In December, a report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) found that just one in 10 employees eligible for the auto-enrolment plan were aware of it. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment, it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” Mr Hodgson said. Out of the people surveyed who were not part of an existing pension plan, more than two-thirds said they would opt in to the scheme in year one but had concerns about affording it. The survey also noted generational differences in people’s attitude towards retirement. “Pre-retirees [people aged 60 to 69] and Gen X [those aged 45 to 60] ranked saving for retirement among their top-three financial priorities, whereas millennials [29-44] ranked it last in their financial priorities,” it said. “The introduction of auto enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement,” Mr Hodgson said.

Title: In Annual Letter, BlackRock’s Larry Fink Omits Climate Change, DEI, And ESG

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan Contributor. Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, ... More Switzerland, on Friday, Jan. 24, 2025. Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg On March 31, BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink released his annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors. After years of advocacy, in 2024, Fink began rolling back support of environmental, social, and governance as a priority. In 2025, ESG, sustainability, climate change, and DEI were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Managing over $11.6 trillion in assets, BlackRock Inc. is the world’s largest asset manager, giving them a large voice in international policy and reactions from businesses. Fink, BlackRock’s founder and CEO, was an early advocate for ESG and stakeholder capitalism, an approach to fiduciary duty that considers broader repercussions to the community and environment in making business decisions. However, conservatives took issue with climate policies and diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially as it relates to LGBTQ+ issues. As conservatives began pushing back on ESG in 2023, criticism of BlackRock and Fink quickly escalated. In response to the conservative backlash, Fink stated he will no longer be using the term ESG, as it had become too political. In the 2024 Chairman’s Letter to Investors, Fink avoided the phrase ESG, opting instead for the terms stakeholder capitalism, sustainable investing, or climate investing. However, none were mentioned in the 2025 letter, indicating a further separation from the issue. In the 2024 letter, Fink introduced a new term — energy pragmatism. Fink explained that there is a balance between “energy transition” to renewable energy as part of the global push to address climate change, and the need for “energy security” spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. By 2025, the the focus on energy shifted to the need for more development, specifically targeting the overly burdensome regulatory requirements and permit process. "In both the U.S. and the EU, it usually takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than to construct them. A high-voltage power line can take 13 years to get approved— something China does in a quarter of the time." “We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix.” Fink goes on to say, "Without massive investments in energy generation and transmission—and the electricians and engineers to build them—we’re going to face an unacceptable tradeoff: Who gets the electricity—people or machines? And a society that chooses to cool its servers while its citizens swelter—or freeze—has fundamentally misplaced its priorities. We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix. "Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can’t reliably keep the lights on. In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down. Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear." Fink’s focus on increased energy production and the adoption of new energy sources that may not align with the climate agenda is a notable shift to the right. This may be a result of his relationship with President Donald Trump or just a smart business move as the climate movement struggles globally. His criticism of overly burdensome regulations also aligns with recent actions by the European Union to simplify sustainability reporting requirements. The President of the European Commission is currently pushing a series of simplification measures, including the Omnibus Simplification Package, aimed at easing the regulatory burden on businesses in the EU. Whether Fink is driving the debate or simply reacting, the omissions in the annual letter are worth noticing.

Title: Goldman Sachs Flags 35% Recession Risk — What This Means For Crypto

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets edged lower Monday following a stark warning from Goldman Sachs, which raised its 12-month US recession probability to 35%, citing rising tariffs, weakening growth, and deteriorating sentiment. The reassessment follows the firm’s second upward revision in March to its 2025 US tariff expectations, signaling an increasingly fraught macroeconomic environment with direct implications for risk assets — including cryptocurrencies. In the note titled “US Economics Analyst: A Further Increase in Our Tariff Assumptions”, Goldman economists Alec Phillips, Tim Walker, and David Mericle outline their rationale: “We now expect the average US tariff rate to rise 15pp in 2025 […] almost the entire revision reflects a more aggressive assumption for ‘reciprocal’ tariffs.” Goldman anticipates that President Trump will announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2. Adjusted for product and country exclusions, the effective rise in average tariffs is expected to be around 9 percentage points. The impact on the macro outlook is stark: Goldman has downgraded its 2025 US GDP growth forecast by 0.5pp to 1.0% (Q4/Q4), lifted its year end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5% (+0.5pp), and increased its unemployment projection to 4.5% (+0.3pp). These revisions reflect a stagnating growth environment paired with inflationary pressures — a combination that constrains monetary stimulus options. The bank attributes the rise in recession probability to three key factors: a lower growth baseline; deteriorating household and business confidence; and “statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.” Despite historically poor predictive power from sentiment measures, Goldman writes: “We are less dismissive of the recent decline because economic fundamentals are not as strong as in prior years. Most importantly, real income growth has already slowed sharply and we expect it to average only 1.4% this year.” While digital assets have long been viewed as uncorrelated to traditional macroeconomic variables, that narrative has evolved. Bitcoin, in particular, has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions — particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields. As the yield curve inverts once again — a classic recession signal — macro analysts are warning of a unique policy dilemma. As @ecoinometrics noted on X: “The yield curve is inverting again, a traditional recession signal. But unlike past cycles, the Fed is unlikely to rush to QE due to inflation concerns. This creates a double challenge for Bitcoin: potential risk-off pressure without the stimulus relief that typically follows. Bitcoin is very much driven by macro these days. It is behaving like a high-beta play on the NASDAQ 100.” However, not everyone agrees that a recession poses a net-negative risk for crypto. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, offered a nuanced view of Bitcoin’s macro sensitivity: “Economic fears. I mean, I don’t know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin […] It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession. It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus. That tends to happen in a recession.” Mitchnick acknowledges the short-term constraints — the wealth effect, reduced disposable income, and high correlations with equities — but maintains that structurally, Bitcoin benefits from the long-term consequences of recessionary policy responses. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system… and to some extent over just fears of general social disorder […] that too, unfortunately, is something that can come up in a recession.” He adds that current market reactions may not reflect Bitcoin’s true positioning: “The market has almost, it seems, gotten this in some ways not particularly well calibrated… but that’s where the opportunity comes in for education in a market and an asset class that’s still very nascent.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,230.

Title: Larry Fink Calls for ‘Democratization of Investing’

Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock Inc., wants to expand investor access to alternative investments and warned that too few Americans are saving for retirement in his annual chairman’s letter. Fink writes that the assets that will “define the future”—including data centers, ports, power grids and the fastest-growing private companies—are out of reach for most investors, only accessible by institutions and high-net-worth individuals. “The reason for the exclusivity has always been risk. Illiquidity. Complexity. That’s why only certain investors are allowed in,” Fink wrote. “But nothing in finance is immutable. Private markets don’t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate.” For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  Fink highlighted BlackRock’s recent acquisitions of private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, infrastructure manager Global Infrastructure Partners and alternatives data firm Preqin, pushing the firm beyond being a traditional asset manager. “BlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we’ve been—first and foremost—a traditional asset manager,” Fink wrote. “That’s who we were at the start of 2024. But it’s not who we are anymore.” The 50/30/20 Portfolio and Infrastructure Fink’s letter suggested the standard portfolio of the future will include allocations to stocks, bonds and private assets, the latter acting as a diversifier, with infrastructure playing an important role. He described a new standard allocation of 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% alternatives. The traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio may well be a thing of the past. “Generations of investors have done well following this approach, owning a mix of the entire market rather than individual securities,” Fink wrote. “But as the global financial system continues to evolve, the classic 60/40 portfolio may no longer fully represent true diversification.” Fink noted three benefits of including infrastructure in a portfolio; inflation protection, volatility protection and strong historical returns. According to BlackRock, adding infrastructure to both a 60/40 portfolio and a pension portfolio increases returns and decreases portfolio volatility. Also according to BlackRock, $68 trillion in infrastructure investment will be needed between 2024 and 2040, which Fink described as the equivalent of building the U.S. interstate highway system and its transcontinental railroad every six weeks for 15 years. But for infrastructure investments to make sense for individuals and for retirement accounts, Fink called for the deregulation of infrastructure permitting. “We can’t democratize investing if it takes 13 years to build a power line,” Fink wrote, noting that it typically takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than it takes to build them. “Giving retirement investors access to infrastructure matters less if the infrastructure never gets built. That’s often the case today.” Investing for Retirement According to a January BlackRock survey, 33% of Americans have no retirement savings, 51% are more worried about outliving their savings than about dying, and one-third of Americans would have a hard time paying an unexpected $500 bill. One way to fix the “retirement gap” is to increase access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, according to Fink. “We’re going to need better ways to boost portfolios,” Fink wrote. “As I wrote earlier, private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns. Pension funds have invested in these assets for decades, but 401(k)s haven’t. It’s one reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year.” According to BlackRock, that additional 0.5% every year, when compounded over 40 years, will result in 14.5% more money in a 401(k) plan by the time of retirement. “Or, put another way, private assets just bought you nine extra years hanging out with your grandkids,” Fink wrote. Still, there is a long way to go before alternative investments become ubiquitous in employer-sponsored defined contributions plans. While the number of plan sponsors implementing alternative strategies in their plans has increased, sponsors are often faced with lawsuits by plan participants alleging that such investments are violating the plans’ fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The illiquidity of these assets is another issue. “When you invest in private assets—like a bridge, for example—the values of those assets aren’t updated daily, and you can’t withdraw your money whenever you want,” Fink wrote. “It’s a bridge, after all—not a stock.” But Fink is confident that alts will play a role in the retirement accounts of the future. “Asset managers, private-market specialists, consultants, and advisers all play a role in guiding 401(k) providers. That’s part of the reason I’m writing this letter—to cut through the fog,” Fink wrote. “We need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They’re beneficial. And they’re becoming increasingly transparent.” Another important financial wellness tool for American, Fink wrote, is expanding emergency savings. “No one invests for retirement if they’re worried about paying for a flat tire or ER visit tomorrow,” Fink wrote. He called the emergency savings provision of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 “just a start” and suggested, “We can simplify the rules further, raise contribution limits, and enable automatic enrollment in standalone emergency accounts.” Related Stories: BlackRock More Than Doubles Private Credit Business With HPS Investment Partners Acquisition BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter Tags: Alternative Investments, BlackRock, Larry Fink, Retirement « Temasek Asset Management Unit Seviora Opens Shop in Abu Dhabi

Title: BlackRock CEO warns US dollar could lose global reserve status to Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-03-31T18:33:39Z

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink issued a stark warning in his 2025 annual letter to investors, saying that the United States risks losing its global reserve currency status to Bitcoin. “If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if the deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote in his 2025 annual letter to investors. His comments come as BlackRock’s own actions echo this conviction. Since launching its spot Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has accumulated over 575,000 BTC, cementing its position as both the largest asset manager and the largest holder of Bitcoin in the ETF space. Fink’s remarks and the firm’s Bitcoin strategy signal that BlackRock views Bitcoin as the dominant digital asset class poised to lead the financial future. Although he emphasized his support for digital innovation, he warned that the same technology could erode America’s edge if investors begin viewing Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the dollar. Recent developments have underscored the urgency of Fink’s warning. Earlier this month, Moody’s downgraded its outlook on US debt to negative, citing rising concerns over former President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs and unfunded tax cuts. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Policy Center has projected that the US could default on its obligations as early as July if Congress fails to intervene. Fink’s warning on US debt came alongside an optimistic outlook on innovation. He described tokenization as one of the most transformative shifts in modern finance. Arguing that converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens would revolutionize investing by enabling instant settlement, democratized access, and better yields. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” he wrote. “If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” The key challenge, he said, is identity verification, which remains a technical and regulatory bottleneck for tokenized markets. Fink cited India’s Aadhaar system as a potential model for the digital financial infrastructure needed to scale such solutions globally. Despite the anxiety voiced by clients and leaders worldwide, Fink expressed long-term optimism in capital markets, calling them one of the most powerful human systems ever created. Yet even that system, he warned, may not be enough to preserve US dominance if Washington fails to get its fiscal house in order. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Issues US Dollar Warning, Says Greenback at Risk of Losing World Reserve Status to Bitcoin

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that the US dollar may be losing its reserve status to Bitcoin (BTC). In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened – not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” BlackRock heavily invested in Bitcoin in 2024 with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which would ultimately become the most successful exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch of all time. Fink, who oversees $11.5 trillion in assets at BlackRock, notes how the world’s financial system runs on “plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,” opening the door for smoother, faster technology like blockchain-based tokenization. The CEO says, “If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself.” “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Blackdog1966/Andy Chipus Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock CEO: 'Protectionism Has Returned With Force'

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink didn't mention President Trump by name in his widely read letter to shareholders in the world's largest asset manager—but days ahead of the rollout of Trump's latest tariffs, he noted that "protectionism has returned with force." "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," Fink wrote. "I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out." Treading cautiously. Fink "treads cautiously" in the influential letter this year, Axios notes. In previous years, calls for BlackRock to do more to tackle climate change and improve workplace diversity led to a backlash from Republicans, reports Reuters. But with the rollback of diversity policies and a deal to buy Panama Canal ports from a Hong Kong-based company, the firm is back in the GOP's good books. "Not everyone has shared in this wealth." Fink said more people are investing in the US stock market, "but not everyone has shared in this wealth," the Financial Times reports. He said that while globalization lifted a billion people around the world out of poverty, "it also held back millions in wealthier nations striving for a better life." "The unspoken assumption is that capitalism didn't work and it's time to try something new," he wrote. "But there's another way to look at it: Capitalism did work—just for too few people." Leveling the playing field. Fink, whose firm oversees more than $11 trillion in assets, called for the "democratization" of investing, saying individuals should have greater access to the private assets that have delivered large returns to big investors like pension funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Assets that will define the future—data centers, ports, power grids, the world's fastest-growing private companies—aren't available to most investors," he wrote. "They're in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants." The full letter, which touches on subjects including bitcoin, nuclear power, and artificial intelligence, can be seen here. (More Larry Fink stories.)

We translate Global Voices stories to make the world's citizen media available to everyone. Panama Canal. Screenshot from YouTube HISTORY channel. Fair Use. The Hong Kong-listed CK Hutchison corporation became the target of China's ire after the corporation seemed poised to make a multibillion-dollar port deal with a US-led international consortium, selling 43 ports with 199 berths in 23 countries. The deal was initially set to be signed on or before April 2, 2025, but it is now on hold due to Beijing's opposition. The agreement, which was announced on March 4, 2025, took Beijing by surprise as among the 43 ports are the two biggest ports in Panama, Cristobal and Balboa. The buyer is the US investment firm BlackRock Inc., along with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an infrastructure investment firm recently acquired by BlackRock, and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), a terminal operator owned by a Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company. Once the deal was made public, US President Donald Trump hailed victory for “reclaiming” the Canal, while Hong Kong-listed CK Hutchison was quickly blamed for China's diplomatic setback. Eventually, China's State Administration for Market Regulation stated it would review the deal to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, and the Hong Kong-based multinational had to defer its plan. It’s now uncertain if the deal will go through at all, even though the package did not include any ports from China and Hong Kong. Geopolitical scientists pointed out that Beijing's reaction was related to its interest in maintaining the country's global trade network: #Panama: Why did #China pressure Hutchison Port Holdings to delay the @BlackRock deal? Hutchison was the single largest Chinese company in the business. A deal for 43 ports in 23 countries — 199 berths — would have meant one-third of #PRC‘s global port network wiped out instantly. pic.twitter.com/fYxyAqV8R1 — Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD) March 28, 2025 However, its decision has now both jeopardised Hong Kong's image as a free-trade center and also seemingly verified Donald Trump's accusation that Hutchison was acting as an extended arm of China to control the artificial canal that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. The foreign interference allegations could become an excuse for the US to take control of the Panama Canal by force under the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, which was signed in 1977, when the US handed the Canal over to Panama. It guarantees that the Canal shall be permanently neutral to vessels of all nations both in time of peace and in time of war and that the US could use its military to defend the Panama Canal against any threat to its neutrality. In fact, Donald Trump threatened to take over the Canal soon after his presidential inauguration. He accused China of foreign interference in Panama and described the Canal transit fee as “exorbitant”. The Chinese government rebuked the accusation, stressing that “China does not take part in managing or operating the Canal. Never ever has China interfered.” Panama also denied the Chinese interference claim, but under US pressure, the country eventually quit China’s Belt and Road Initiative in early February 2025 and has been strengthening ties with the US: REPORT: Panama will now allow United States Navy ships free passage through the Panama Canal, saving the United States millions of dollars a year. The development comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip to Panama. “U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama… pic.twitter.com/jACxs1sK6o — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) February 6, 2025 And, on the legal front, Panama’s attorney general backed the claim that concessions with Hong Kong’s Hutchison Ports on the Panama Canal are “unconstitutional”. Caught in the crossfire between Beijing and Washington, CK Hutchison’s deal was initially well-received by the market, as reflected in its stock price surge. The USD 22.8 billion sell-off could generate USD 19 billion in cash and could prevent further political pressure from the US government, which might result in the nullification of Hutchison’s port contract with Panama. Since 1997, Hutchison has invested over USD 2 billion in the two port facilities, and in 2021, the concession was extended for another 25 years. However, China is not happy. Although the Chinese foreign ministry still stuck to the political line that the allegation concerning China’s control over the Canal was a lie and protested “economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying” after the agreement was released, Hong Kong-based Chinese propaganda slammed CK Hutchison’s deal as a betrayal of the “motherland” through a series of commentaries which were republished on the website of Beijing’s top office on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. The patriotic opinion pieces were first published in China's state-funded Ta Kung Pao on March 14. The first piece rejects CK Hutchison’s explanation that the deal was a purely commercial decision. It describes Blackrock’s role as an expanding US port operator that would repress China’s international trade upon taking over CK Hutchison’s port and concludes the deal was an act of betrayal: …網友普遍對這個交易和長江和記公司提出強烈質疑和批評，認為這是沒有腰骨的跪低，是唯利是圖、見利忘義，漠視國家利益、民族大義，背叛和出賣全體中國人。 [Social media users] in general strongly criticise the deal and CK Hutchison for being spineless, grovelling and profit-seeking. [Such an act] trades away one’s integrity for personal gains, disregards national interests, and betrays all Chinese people. The second commentary praises other Hong Kong business leaders, including Henry Fok Ying-tung and Yue-kong Pao, for staying loyal to the party and, in particular, highlights Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei’s role in safeguarding the technological sovereignty of the Chinese telecommunication industry. It urges Chinese businessmen to safeguard China’s national interest. The third and fourth pieces were written in a similar manner, stressing the need for the business sector to serve national interest and demanding that CK Hutchison suspend the deal. Pro-Beijing influencers also relay China’s discontent. @Hnbhger17, for example, argued on X that CK Hutchison should prioritize selling its port to Chinese corporations, or the deal would negatively impact China's national security. Many media outlets interpreted the propaganda messages as a sign that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, was angry about the deal. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s top leader, John Lee, stressed: We oppose the abusive use of coercion, of bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations […] the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law. Eventually, China said it would scrutinise the port deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. Yet, since CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the port deal has not included any port in Chinese territories, both Hong Kong and China have a relatively weak legal position to challenge the agreement. Though, as law expert Kevin Yam pointed out, the Hong Kong’s National Security Committee still has the power to give legally binding directions to the Li family or the Hong Kong-based multinational to procure the halting of the Panama port deal, adding that such an act would be a “nuclear option” that could cause immense harm to the business sector. CK Hutchison’s retired founder Li Ka-Shing has faced many rounds of political criticism in the past decade — in October 2014, he was criticised by China's state-owned Xinhua News for not vocally denouncing the pro-democracy Umbrella Protests. The state-owned news outlet again criticised Li for moving his investment offshore to the Cayman Islands after a major corporate restructuring in 2015. Li dismissed the so-called “Cultural Revolution style” criticisms. In 2019, during Hong Kong's pro-democracy protest movement, Li faced similar criticism as he did not use strong words to condemn the street protests. Li Ka-Shing retired in 2018 and handed over his businesses to his son, Victor Li. The 96-year-old tycoon remains a legendary figure. He built his business empire from scratch after his family fled to Hong Kong in 1940 amid the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). He was among the first batch of Hong Kong businessmen who brought foreign capital into Chinese special economic zones after former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping adopted the Open Door Policy in the 1970s. While China's interest in the port in Panama makes sense, the dispute could very well scare foreign investments and multinationals away from Hong Kong. Beijing’s public pressure campaign against the Hong Kong-listed firm CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control the city's independent business interests. https://t.co/08jcdaudmR pic.twitter.com/2cpzWMFOoe — The Diplomat (@Diplomat_APAC) March 28, 2025 Global Voices stands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.

Title: China blocks $23B sale of Panama Canal ports to US-backed consortium led by BlackRock

Full Content:
China has held up the $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide — including two key ports in the Panama Canal — to a group led by US investing giant BlackRock after President Trump expressed concern about Beijing’s sway over the strategic shipping lanes. On March 4, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. China President Xi Jinping is reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s plans to sell its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand, according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal — spearheaded by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a longtime Trump confidante — called for an agreement to be signed by April 2, though it now is likely that the Wednesday deadline will be missed. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told The Post. Insiders say Chinese leadership had hoped to leverage the port issue in its talks with the Trump administration, only to be caught off guard by the deal’s sudden progress. Trump hailed the development as a strategic win over China — casting Panama as a key battleground in the broader US-China struggle for global influence. In response, an op-ed published in the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao condemned the sale as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” The timing of the deal’s announcement, coming just before the start of the “two sessions,” China’s most significant annual political and economic gathering, only deepened the offense for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Panama Canal — used extensively by both the US and China — has reemerged as a flashpoint in global politics after President Trump renewed his pledge to assert American dominance over the waterway. Beijing’s move to influence the affairs of CK Hutchison reinforced concerns among global observers about China’s diminishing distinction between private and public sectors as well as its aggressive encroachment into Hong Kong’s affairs. Trump has claimed that the canal is controlled by China and operated by its military. In reality, CK Hutchison, the company at the heart of the port sale, is headquartered in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region historically afforded a high degree of operational independence from Beijing. The dispute over the canal’s ports arises at a sensitive moment as China faces ongoing tensions from a US trade war. This week, Trump is expected to announce a new round of so-called “reciprocal tariffs.” Advertisement

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo (Bloomberg) — President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a “predictable” business environment, China’s market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing’s deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to “protect public interests.” Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of acting “in concert with US hegemony” over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the US president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock Inc. as America “reclaiming” the famed waterway. Beijing’s attempts to influence the operations of a private firm in Latin America risk undercutting Xi’s bid to bolster confidence in the world’s No. 2 economy, where foreign investment last year fell to the lowest level in decades. Derailing the deal could also give credence to the US leaders’ claims CK Hutchison is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party — a perception with implications for private Chinese companies worldwide. “This flies in the face of the charm offensive for private firms,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Center, formerly chief economist at UBS. “Beijing has, in effect, told the world there is no real difference between private and public in the Chinese Communist Party’s eyes.” CK Hutchison shares dropped the most in more than a week after resuming trading Monday. Work on the Panama ports deal is continuing, though the parties won’t be able to sign the definitive agreement by the original target of April 2, people familiar with the matter said. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing opposed coercion at a regular briefing Monday in Beijing, referring to Trump’s efforts to pressure the Panama government to curb Chinese influence. The State Administration for Market Regulation didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. The Panama Canal, used mainly by the US and China, became a geopolitical lightning rod after Trump vowed to retake it. The US president has falsely said the canal is operated by the Chinese and controlled by the Chinese military. CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous former British colony where companies are given wide berth to operate free from Beijing’s control. The spat over the ports comes at a delicate time, as China grapples with a US trade war that will likely this week see Trump unveil new so-called reciprocal tariffs. For Xi, there are few good options: Blocking the Panama deal risks more retaliation from Washington, while letting it go ahead removes a potential bargaining chip once negotiations between Chinese and US officials finally get underway. The dilemma also comes as the Chinese leader tries to build on DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough spurring a revival in animal spirits, with Xi’s recent embrace of Jack Ma signaling to CEOs the era of regulatory crackdowns is over. “Beijing won’t hesitate to intervene if it believes a Chinese company is being pressured by a foreign government to sell its assets to foreign investors,” research firm Trivium China said in a note. Until a formal agreement on the port deal is signed, China’s ability to directly block the transaction is limited. That could explain why Beijing is ramping up pressure through less formal channels, hoping that Li will walk away from the deal. Opening a probe into a deal spanning 43 facilities over multiple continents would mark the latest example of Beijing extending the long arm of its statecraft toolkit. That comes after China last year expanded its export control regime to include a ban on selling some goods to the US by applying it to companies both inside and outside China. Beijing has precedent for influencing deals overseas when the companies involved have a major presence in China. Chinese officials effectively scuttled Intel Corp.’s $5.4 billion bid for Israel’s Tower Semiconductor Ltd. in 2023 by delaying approval as US-China tensions rose. The year before, DuPont de Nemours Inc. scrapped a proposed $5.2 billion acquisition of Rogers Corp. after failing to get timely clearance from Beijing. China sales accounted for more than a third of Rogers’ 2021 revenue. China could even frame its action as a countermeasure to foreign sanctions, invoking a new law that gives Beijing broad power to strike back at perceived foreign meddling, according to Winston Ma, adjunct law professor at New York University. “The countermeasure could have far-reaching implications for cross-border transactions and the various parties involved,” Ma said. After years of deleveraging from China, CK Hutchison now gets more than 80% of its revenue from overseas countries including the UK, Canada and Australia. That means Beijing has limited scope to influence Li directly. But his two sons are more exposed. CK Asset — the company’s property arm now headed by Li’s older son Victor — has one-fifth of its long-term rental investment property portfolio by area on the mainland. Richard Li’s insurance company, FWD Group Holdings Ltd., has stated its ambition to expand into mainland China in financial documents, which would likely require partnerships with Chinese companies. For the Hong Kong conglomerate caught in the crossfire, there are downsides to both outcomes, according to Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics. If the deal goes ahead, Li’s affiliated companies in China “could be exposed to a substantial fine,” he said. “If the deal collapses, the risk is that the company will now be seen as part and parcel of Chinese interests abroad.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Could Threaten Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status, BlackRock’s Larry Fink

Still a big fan of digital assets, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink nevertheless said he's not blind to the possible risks to the U.S. from Bitcoin's (BTC) rise to prominence. “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades," said Fink in his annual letter to shareholders.But that’s not guaranteed to last forever … If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” "I'm obviously not anti-digital assets," Fink continued." But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink’s letter comes at a time of high market uncertainty and anxiety among investors about the economic state of the country amid policy changes set in place by U.S. President Donald Trump. To balance out the national deficit, Fink said, investors should diversify their portfolios to add private market assets in addition to stocks and bonds. Doubling down on his commitment and belief in digital assets, Fink said he believes that tokenized funds will be as well-known among investors as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), provided that the industry can create a better infrastructure for digital identities, which Fink believes to be a hurdle in getting institutional investors from fully embracing decentralized finance. “Every stock, every bond, every fund— every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,” he wrote. “ If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.” BlackRock, in January 2024, became one of the issuers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Their product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), became the most successful ETF in the history of the asset class. As of today, the fund handles nearly $50 billion in assets, with half of that coming from retail investors. The asset manager has also issued a tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which is on track to cross $2 billion in assets by April, making it the largest tokenized fund currently on the market.

Title: Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock — this time in private markets

BlackRock was founded as a "traditional asset manager," and it became the largest by disrupting that industry by offering cheap ETFs to the masses. But, as the firm's cofounder and CEO, Larry Fink, wrote in his annual letter, "It's not who we are anymore." "We've transformed our company," Fink wrote about the $11.6 trillion juggernaut. The firm's private-market ambitions are no secret — BlackRock spent $28 billion last year buying up Global Infrastructure Partners and HPS Investment Partners as well as Preqin, a data provider that focuses on private markets. Fink and fellow executives have spoken at length about their ambitions in the area on earnings calls and more. Still, it's rare for any company to pivot away from what has been its bread-and-butter profit engine, much less the industry leader. BlackRock's business lines in public markets, from its overwhelming iShares ETF line to its fixed-income mutual fund products, manage trillions of dollars, produce billions in revenue each year, and have fundamentally changed the way markets and investors behave. But Fink wrote that he is eyeing something bigger with BlackRock's next phase: the "$68 billion investment boom" coming in privately funded infrastructure, the continued explosion of private lending, and eventually, the indexing of private markets. "In some ways, this moment feels like a bookend to how BlackRock started," Fink wrote. When the firm was founded 37 years ago, Fink wrote, it changed the asset management industry thanks to its risk management software known as Aladdin. The firm's ETF business — which manages more than $4 trillion — brought down fees industrywide in both active and passive funds, squeezing asset manager margins in ways they'd never been before. "Decades from now, we might reflect on 2025 as another pivotal moment, when the financial landscape shifted once again," he wrote. And it is shifting to the private markets because the 60-40 portfolio that had investors split assets between public equities and bonds will become the 50-30-20 portfolio, with a fifth of capital going "assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit," Fink wrote. That type of portfolio for the typical individual investor — the ones not in the upper tiers of the tax bracket, but instead saving for retirement with BlackRock index funds — has been unobtainable, Fink wrote, thanks to high minimums and other restrictions on private-market investing. "The divide between public and private markets is a tough problem — but it's solvable. In fact, BlackRock has solved market challenges like this before," Fink wrote, comparing it to the divide between active and passive investing in the public markets. "We see an opportunity to do for the public-private market divide what we did for index vs. active," he said. While Fink's letter has some political undertones, addressing wealth disparities and how markets and capitalism have exacerbated them, it does not mention ESG investing or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Fink was a leading voice on both issues prior to the new US administration, but BlackRock has joined others in the corporate world in toning down past statements. The manager's latest annual report reframed its DEI section as "connectivity and inclusivity," Business Insider previously reported. Fink, who wrote that he started on Wall Street in the 1970s with "long hair, turquoise jewelry, and the world's ugliest brown suit," is nonetheless optimistic despite the political turmoil. He closed his letter stating that the firm "entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point, and I see greater opportunities ahead for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders than ever before."

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink confirms Bitcoin could replace US dollar as global currency amid rising US debt

BlackRock chairman warns that unchecked U.S. deficits could pave the way for Bitcoin to become a global reserve currency. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink officially recognized in his 2025 annual letter to shareholders that Bitcoin can challenge the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. The letter explicitly frames Bitcoin as both a disruptive innovation and a geopolitical risk should the U.S. government fail to rein in debt and deficits. Fink wrote in the firm’s March 2025 letter, “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” The comment marks a clear acknowledgment from the head of the world’s largest asset manager that digital assets could represent an alternative to the U.S. dollar in global markets. Fink mentioned Bitcoin by name seven times throughout the letter while referencing the dollar eight times. The significance of this parallel frequency in Fink’s annual letter cannot be overstated. A few years ago, who would have thought that Larry Fink would spend as much time talking about Bitcoin as the US dollar in an annual letter to investors? The BlackRock letter outlines a split view that while DeFi is praised as “an extraordinary innovation,” the firm cautions that its growth could undermine America’s financial primacy. The risk emerges if investors begin treating Bitcoin as a more stable long-term store of value than the U.S. dollar, particularly given ongoing federal deficits and sovereign debt levels. This framing positions Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset or store of value and as a macro hedge against sovereign instability. The implications parallel similar arguments made in recent years by institutional investors treating digital assets as insurance against monetary debasement or geopolitical volatility. As Fink emphasized, “two things can be true at the same time,” referring to the coexistence of innovation and risk in digital asset development. BlackRock’s internal positioning on Bitcoin is not purely theoretical. The letter disclosed that its U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF became the largest product launch in the history of the ETF industry, reaching over $50 billion in assets under management within its first year. It also ranked third in net asset inflows across all ETF categories, behind only S&P 500 index funds. Retail adoption was a key driver, with more than half the demand for the firm’s Bitcoin ETP coming from individual investors. Notably, three-quarters of those participants had never previously owned an iShares product, suggesting Bitcoin is acting as an onboarding mechanism for a new demographic of investors. The firm has also expanded its ETP offerings into Canada and Europe, signaling cross-border growth in institutional-grade Bitcoin investment vehicles. Beyond Bitcoin, Fink’s letter advanced a broader thesis that tokenization could transform capital markets in ways comparable to the shift from postal mail to email. Drawing a comparison to the SWIFT network, Fink argued that tokenized asset infrastructure could bypass traditional financial intermediaries by enabling instant, peer-to-peer asset movement. BlackRock sees tokenization as a foundational shift in asset ownership, mainly through fractionalization, improved voting systems, and increased access to high-yield investment instruments. According to the letter, these developments could democratize capital markets by lowering the operational and legal barriers that have historically limited retail investor participation in certain asset classes. The firm also emphasized the need for updated digital identity systems, citing India’s model as a benchmark. According to the letter, over 90% of Indians can securely verify smartphone transactions, positioning the country as a leader in the digital infrastructure necessary for tokenized economies. The inclusion of Bitcoin as a potential replacement for the dollar reflects a material shift in institutional perception. While mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as “digital gold” has grown in recent years, BlackRock’s language points to a deeper economic thesis—one in which macroeconomic policy failure could accelerate a pivot to decentralized monetary systems. By citing both tokenization and Bitcoin within the same strategic outlook, the letter presents a framework where digital assets are possible systemic alternatives to fiat. For policymakers, the message is implicit but pointed: the U.S. must modernize its financial systems and manage its debt trajectory to maintain monetary leadership.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged over the last year, with the bitcoin price soaring to record highs as a perfect storm of Washington DC and Wall Street collide. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of $110,000 per bitcoin reached in January ahead of U.S. president Donald Trump’s return to the White House (and hit by fears of a mystery new threat). Now, as top traders bet on a looming Federal Reserve flip, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has warned bitcoin could be “eating away” at the U.S. dollar’s world’s reserve currency status. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the most bullish Wall Street voices on ... More bitcoin and crypto, helping push the bitcoin price to record highs last year. "The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever," Fink wrote in his BlackRock annual letter, pointing to ballooning nation debt that’s seen this year’s interest payments alone top $952 billion. “By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like bitcoin.” U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024 before climbing over $35 trillion just a year later, with Covid-era stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." “To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it),” Fink wrote, pointing to his plan to “democratize” access to finance and markets with crypto technology. "But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink’s warning echos similar sentiment expressed by the likes of Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, who last month called the climbing U.S. debt clock “terrifying" and last year repeatedly warned of U.S. financial collapse while on the campaign trail for Trump. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen from its all-time high but remains well above its 2024 levels. Earlier this month, Fink warned Trump’s trade policies will see a return of inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

Title: Mindshare-driven, high-momentum bets are the future of crypto VC investing

Leveraging fast-paced, narrative-based strategies helps VCs navigate the shifting crypto landscape and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post and opinion of Hatu Sheikh, the founder of Coin Terminal. The traditional crypto VC investing model has failed. VC firms have returned to their drawing boards to strategically reorganize and optimally allocate funds in a highly competitive market. Driven by cyclical market conditions, VCs have realized their success doesn’t depend on following a fundamental conviction. Instead, it hinges on investing in projects with dominant mindshare, strong narratives, and successful go-to-market (GTM) execution strategies. Inspired by the recent rise of mindshare-led investments, VC investing is shifting from long-term to short-term, high-momentum bets. Crypto VCs, who once shaped industry narratives with large capital reserves, have become weaker in recent years. Multiple internal and external factors have been responsible for the subdued VC landscape. According to a JP Morgan research report, regulatory uncertainty under the Joe Biden administration and enforcement actions against major companies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had kept away VCs. Further, the growth of crypto ETPs and institutional capital inflows from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have diverted capital away from VC firms. Large investors like hedge funds and endowment agencies have gained exposure to crypto via liquid financial instruments rather than early-stage VC investing. High interest rates have also lowered VCs’ risk appetite. This compromises investments in high-risk products with greater ROIs, although speculation and volatility are intertwined with crypto — they’re features, not bugs. To top it off, standardized VC crypto funding is inherently broken. The massive failure of VC-backed firms that funded projects in 2021-2022 has cautioned generalist VCs. The failure reflects a lack of a proper investment strategy rather than a dismissal of the industry itself. Overall, capital allocation to venture funds has declined over the years. Crypto VC fundraising was the lowest in 2024 in the last five years, with just $5.1 billion raised. Despite a bull market in 2024, VC investments have been inversely proportional to the success of the crypto markets. The liquid crypto market added $1.6 trillion to its total market cap in 2024, rising 88% YoY to $3.4 trillion. Yet, VCs invested just $11.5 billion in crypto startups. The stark difference represents VCs’ pessimism and failure to understand the essence of crypto markets. While chasing fundamentals, VCs have forgotten to tap into the hottest meta and dominant market narratives. In turn, their shrinking capital reserves have flown into white elephant projects without substantial returns, making VC investing entirely unprofitable. On the contrary, retail users who invested in categories occupying the highest mindshare and actionable real-world use cases have been immensely successful. VCs have a lot to learn from this retail-led investment strategy. The JP Morgan report noted that several crypto startups have avoided token sales to VCs and turned to community-driven fundraising strategies in 2024. Community, the centerpiece of crypto, has thus reclaimed its space and shown VCs how to stay buoyant in cyclical market narratives. Per a CoinGecko report, memecoins led the market mindshare and were “the most popular crypto narrative in 2024”. The memecoin market cap rose to $137 billion in December 2024, driven mainly by retail investors. Critics have dismissed memecoins as a speculative fad. But memecoins have powered retail crypto adoption as a survey shows over 40% of people were first-time Trump and Melania tokens investors. AI tokens, the second-most popular narrative in 2024, captured 16% of investor mindshare as retailers deployed capital for building futuristic financial technology. The AI token market capitalization can reach $60 billion in 2025, and early investors have an edge as the industry matures. VCs have traditionally preferred fundamentals over mindshare-based investing because they believed the former translates to long-term dividends. As the data suggests, this is not necessarily the case. The crypto industry moves quickly. Blindly following fundamental convictions without updating and acclimatizing to changing market conditions leads to a dead end. VCs have finally realized their mistakes and are ready to shift gears. They’re now leveraging mindshare-based investment strategies to identify disruptive sectors and deploy capital for their growth. Once VCs take cues from the dominant mindshare in a cyclical market, they can invest early in projects with robust GTM plans. Consequently, VCs can book profits when the sector develops and the projects launch consumer-facing apps with real-world uses. Bloomberg suggests the “fintech winter” ended when VC funding was down due to high interest and strict regulations. With more regulatory clarity during the Trump regime, crypto VC funding will pick up pace with an estimated $18 billion in fresh capital inflows. VCs should be wise enough to know how to use these funds. Instead of channeling them into dead fundamentals, they must follow a mindshare-driven investing approach to support early-stage innovations for profitable balance sheets. As multiple narratives compete for limited mindshare in the crypto industry, VCs must know how to utilize their capital reserves. Mindshare-based investing offers a symbiotic alternative, benefitting the industry and VCs simultaneously. Hatu Sheikh is the founder of Coin Terminal. He previously co-founded DAO Maker.

Title: US, China raise the stakes in Panama Canal ports row

Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison this month sold 43 ports in 23 countries -- including operations in the vital Central American canal -- to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. After two weeks of rhetoric, Beijing hardened its response on Friday and confirmed that antitrust regulators will review the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned. Speaking before the review was announced, experts told AFP that the deal allowed US President Donald Trump to claim credit for "taking back" the canal as part of his "America First" agenda. "The US (created) a political issue at China's expense and then has been able to declare victory," said Kurt Tong, managing partner at The Asia Group and a former top US diplomat to Hong Kong. "That doesn't feel good in Beijing." Some of the ports being sold are in nations that participate in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- a global development framework championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Ports are crucial to that network and China "has been notably successful in this area", said Henry Gao, a trade law expert at the Singapore Management University. Last month, Panama formally exited the BRI following a visit from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "There is indeed a growing trend of 'weaponising' ports and trade infrastructure as tools of geopolitical leverage," Gao said. - 'Nightmare' scenario? - On March 4, CK Hutchison sent shockwaves through China's shipping industry by announcing a deal of "unprecedented scale", according to Xie Wenqing, a port development researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. Chinese shipping firms questioned whether they could ensure neutral passage once the ports changed hands, he told AFP. "There are concerns about additional costs for Chinese ships or discriminatory treatment in terms of queuing orders," he added, highlighting the long-arm jurisdiction of US authorities. The deal -- coupled with recent US tariff hikes -- could undermine China's manufacturing dominance, argued Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China. "Increased inspections and additional docking costs would erode China's competitive edge and disrupt global supply chains," he noted. The United States has used various justifications to target key infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative "to strip away these assets and weaken China's position as the world's factory", Wang added. John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said the deal would not serve China's interests but said some concerns were "overblown". Port operators such as CK Hutchison are commercial entities constrained by law and cannot decide matters of national sovereignty, for example whether a ship could visit a port or not. "If (operators) were to blatantly favour one company over another, that would generally speaking... be illegal," Bradford said. "Most countries have laws which say you have to treat different customers similarly, so the nightmare scenarios are not particularly realistic." - Hong Kong's role - Beijing's next steps in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, according to analysts. "This whole Panama ports issue has refocused attention on the question (of) whether Hong Kong is a good place to put assets or to do business," said Tong, the former diplomat. "Certainly the foreign business community operating in Hong Kong is watching this issue very closely." CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. That did not stop the State Administration for Market Regulation from announcing the antitrust review on Friday. Jet Deng, a senior partner at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons, said China's antitrust laws can be applicable outside its borders, similar to those of the United States and the European Union. Once a deal meets China's reportability threshold, a declaration is required even if the transaction takes place abroad, as long as the parties involved had substantial operations in mainland China, he said. Firms that fail to declare may be fined for up to 10 percent of their operating income from the preceding year, Deng added. Hung Ho-fung, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said Beijing risks spooking "cautious" foreign firms that have already lowered their business exposure in Hong Kong. If the deal crumbles under Chinese pressure, people may believe that Hong Kong is converging with mainland China where "national security considerations are of utmost importance in any business deal", Hung said. ll-hol/je/rsc/fox BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News After two weeks of rhetoric, Beijing hardened its response on Friday and confirmed that antitrust regulators will review the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned.

Last month, Panama formally exited the BRI following a visit from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "There is indeed a growing trend of 'weaponising' ports and trade infrastructure as tools of geopolitical leverage," Gao said. - 'Nightmare' scenario? - On March 4, CK Hutchison sent shockwaves through China's shipping industry by announcing a deal of "unprecedented scale", according to Xie Wenqing, a port development researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. Chinese shipping firms questioned whether they could ensure neutral passage once the ports changed hands, he told AFP. "There are concerns about additional costs for Chinese ships or discriminatory treatment in terms of queuing orders," he added, highlighting the long-arm jurisdiction of US authorities. The deal -- coupled with recent US tariff hikes -- could undermine China's manufacturing dominance, argued Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China. "Increased inspections and additional docking costs would erode China's competitive edge and disrupt global supply chains," he noted. The United States has used various justifications to target key infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative "to strip away these assets and weaken China's position as the world's factory", Wang added. John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said the deal would not serve China's interests but said some concerns were "overblown". Port operators such as CK Hutchison are commercial entities constrained by law and cannot decide matters of national sovereignty, for example whether a ship could visit a port or not. "If (operators) were to blatantly favour one company over another, that would generally speaking... be illegal," Bradford said. "Most countries have laws which say you have to treat different customers similarly, so the nightmare scenarios are not particularly realistic." - Hong Kong's role - Beijing's next steps in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, according to analysts. "This whole Panama ports issue has refocused attention on the question (of) whether Hong Kong is a good place to put assets or to do business," said Tong, the former diplomat. "Certainly the foreign business community operating in Hong Kong is watching this issue very closely." CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. That did not stop the State Administration for Market Regulation from announcing the antitrust review on Friday. Jet Deng, a senior partner at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons, said China's antitrust laws can be applicable outside its borders, similar to those of the United States and the European Union. Once a deal meets China's reportability threshold, a declaration is required even if the transaction takes place abroad, as long as the parties involved had substantial operations in mainland China, he said. Firms that fail to declare may be fined for up to 10 percent of their operating income from the preceding year, Deng added. Hung Ho-fung, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said Beijing risks spooking "cautious" foreign firms that have already lowered their business exposure in Hong Kong. If the deal crumbles under Chinese pressure, people may believe that Hong Kong is converging with mainland China where "national security considerations are of utmost importance in any business deal", Hung said. ll-hol/je/rsc/fox BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News Some of the ports being sold are in nations that participate in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- a global development framework championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

"Most countries have laws which say you have to treat different customers similarly, so the nightmare scenarios are not particularly realistic." - Hong Kong's role - Beijing's next steps in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, according to analysts. "This whole Panama ports issue has refocused attention on the question (of) whether Hong Kong is a good place to put assets or to do business," said Tong, the former diplomat. "Certainly the foreign business community operating in Hong Kong is watching this issue very closely." CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. That did not stop the State Administration for Market Regulation from announcing the antitrust review on Friday. Jet Deng, a senior partner at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons, said China's antitrust laws can be applicable outside its borders, similar to those of the United States and the European Union. Once a deal meets China's reportability threshold, a declaration is required even if the transaction takes place abroad, as long as the parties involved had substantial operations in mainland China, he said. Firms that fail to declare may be fined for up to 10 percent of their operating income from the preceding year, Deng added. Hung Ho-fung, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said Beijing risks spooking "cautious" foreign firms that have already lowered their business exposure in Hong Kong. If the deal crumbles under Chinese pressure, people may believe that Hong Kong is converging with mainland China where "national security considerations are of utmost importance in any business deal", Hung said. ll-hol/je/rsc/fox BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News Port operators such as CK Hutchison are commercial entities constrained by law and cannot decide matters of national sovereignty, for example whether a ship could visit a port or not.

Title: Fractional Dreams: How Tokenisation is Unlocking Assets in Emerging Markets (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

Imagine a young professional in Nairobi buying a digital slice of a new apartment building, a cattle farmer in Bolivia selling tokens backed by his herd, or a street vendor in Mumbai investing in a fraction of a tech company’s stock – all through a smartphone. This isn’t sci‑fi finance; it’s the promise of fractionalisation and tokenisation. These buzzwords are redefining who gets to own assets and how, especially across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In this long read, we’ll demystify what tokenisation and fractionalisation really mean, explore why they matter for financially underserved populations, and dive into real‑world examples in real estate, equities, and even livestock. The goal: help you understand (and maybe even get excited about) how a fractional future could unlock wealth and opportunity in emerging markets. Demystifying Tokenisation and Fractionalisation Let’s start with the basics. Tokenisation is essentially turning an asset or a right into a digital token – a kind of digital certificate of ownership recorded on a blockchain. Think of a token as a digital deed or share that proves you own something of value. It could be a token representing a square meter of land, a share of stock, or one cow in a herd. Once created, these tokens live on a blockchain, making their ownership records immutable and tamper‑proof. In practical terms, tokenisation often uses smart contracts (self‑executing code on the blockchain) to automate the process of splitting and managing ownership. For example, a property could be divided into digital shares via a smart contract so that investors can buy or sell parts of it by trading tokens. These tokens can be designed to carry information like ownership rights, dividend or rental entitlements, and transaction history – all baked into code. Fractionalisation, on the other hand, is the process of splitting an asset into smaller pieces (fractions) so that multiple people can own a portion of it. It’s a concept as old as joint ownership, but blockchain‑based tokenisation turbocharges it. If tokenisation is turning an asset into a tradable digital form, fractionalisation is what lets many people hold a piece of that digital asset. An easy analogy is slicing a big pizza: Instead of one person devouring a whole pie, it’s cut into slices so a group can each enjoy a piece. In finance, this means a million‑dollar asset can be split into, say, a million $1 tokens. Each token holder owns a tiny slice. By combining tokenisation with fractionalisation, almost any asset can be divided and distributed to many owners quickly and with low friction. A simple example: imagine a $100,000 real estate property represented by 100,000 tokens – each token might represent a $1 stake in the property’s value and any corresponding rental income. You could buy 50 tokens for $50 and legitimately claim 0.05% ownership. Thanks to blockchain’s transparency, everyone’s fractional ownership is securely recorded and easily verifiable. The beauty of this “power couple” of finance is that it brings automation, security, and trust to shared ownership. Blockchains operate 24/7, so these tokens can be traded peer‑to‑peer at any time, without the heavy paperwork of traditional asset sales. Transfers are near‑instant and don’t rely on a parade of middlemen for clearing or settlement, which reduces costs and friction. Smart contracts can even handle things like distributing dividends or rental income to token holders automatically (no accountant writing 1000 cheques). In short, tokenisation turns assets into programmable pieces and fractionalisation ensures even the “little guy” can hold a piece. Why Tokenisation Matters for Emerging Markets So, why should someone in an emerging market care about these fancy concepts? Because they have the potential to democratize finance and unlock access in places where traditional systems haven’t fully delivered. In many emerging economies, large segments of the population are underserved by banks or excluded from investing. Owning property or stocks is often a luxury reserved for the wealthy or well‑connected. Meanwhile, many people store their wealth in informal assets – cash stashed under a mattress, gold jewelry, or livestock in the field – because formal investments feel out of reach. Tokenisation directly tackles some of these barriers: All these reasons boil down to one big theme: financial inclusion. By breaking big assets into bite‑sized digital pieces, tokenisation and fractionalisation extend the investing club to far more people. Importantly, this isn’t just theoretical. It’s already underway in various forms across emerging markets. Let’s delve into three key asset classes – real estate, equities, and livestock – to see how it works in practice and why it matters. Real Estate: Owning Property One Token at a Time Real estate is often seen as a stable way to build wealth, but owning property traditionally requires huge upfront capital and involves plenty of red tape. In cities from Lagos to Lahore, property prices can be stratospheric relative to local incomes, meaning the vast majority can only ever dream of owning a piece of prime real estate. Tokenisation is starting to change that equation by dividing bricks and mortar into bits and bytes. Take Kenya, for example. The Kenyan government is building a high‑tech new city called Konza Technopolis, with a hefty budget running into billions. It’s the kind of large‑scale project that typically only big investors or funds would have a stake in. But imagine everyone being able to own a slice of that city’s development through fractional tokens. Kenya’s regulators are already looking ahead by admitting blockchain‑based real estate platforms into controlled regulatory sandboxes. These pilots use smart contracts to automate splitting property into digital shares, letting investors buy and sell fractional ownership. The authorities see these models as an “important stride” toward enhancing retail participation in the real estate market, giving ordinary Kenyans access to a highly coveted asset class that was previously out of reach. Other African nations are dipping toes in as well. South Africa has seen tokenised commercial property deals, and Nigeria is exploring tokenised real estate in Lagos to attract retail investors. Even where formal projects are still nascent, the interest is high. In Uganda, for instance, innovators have crunched the numbers on how fractional ownership could work. Consider a commercial building valued at a significant sum; it could be tokenised into hundreds of thousands of tokens, each representing a tiny ownership stake. An investor buying a modest number of tokens would own a small percentage of the building and earn a proportional share of the rental income. And when the investor wants out, they could sell their tokens to someone else, rather than having to endure a months‑long property sale. It effectively transforms a brick‑and‑mortar asset into a liquid investment. The benefits for the broader market are significant. By lowering the barrier to entry, tokenised real estate can tap into pools of capital that were previously sidelined. A middle‑class family in Accra or a collective of school teachers in Lima could pool funds to back a housing development via tokens. This democratises funding for projects – potentially helping address housing shortages. Liquidity is another plus: real estate usually can’t be sold quickly, but token markets promise more fluid trading. It’s not just startups and crypto enthusiasts pushing this. Even major global players are on board, lending credibility. Firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have launched initiatives in tokenised assets, indicating that a significant chunk of assets may shift on‑chain in coming years. That institutional vote of confidence bodes well for emerging markets adopting similar tech. And regulators, while cautious, are increasingly open‑minded. Beside Kenya’s sandbox, jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Thailand are actively updating laws to accommodate tokenised real‑world assets. The upshot for a banker or regulator in an emerging market is clear: this trend is real and it’s not going away. Embracing it offers a way to mobilise local investment while expanding access. Equities: Stocks for the People If real estate tokenisation is about broadening property ownership, tokenised equities are about making stock ownership more accessible and versatile. Equities (shares in companies) are already “fractional” in the sense that owning a tiny percentage of a large company is common. But historically, buying stocks required a brokerage account, compliance with local rules, and often a hefty sum of money to get started. In many emerging markets, stock market participation is very low – only a small fraction of the population invests in equities. Barriers include lack of awareness, limited disposable income, and sometimes a dearth of local companies that people feel connected to. Furthermore, if someone in Bangladesh wants to invest in a U.S. tech giant, the hurdles are enormous under traditional finance. Tokenisation can knock down these walls. By creating digital tokens that represent shares (or economic interests in shares) of a company, you can enable people to buy and trade those tokens globally, 24/7, with just a mobile app. Consider a young entrepreneur in Jakarta who idolizes big tech – maybe he can only spare $50, nowhere near enough to buy a full share at market price. But a token platform might offer a fractional token of that stock, so his $50 could get him a piece of a share. Multiply that by millions of aspiring investors and you have a recipe for much broader equity ownership. It’s essentially the “stocks for everyone” idea that some fintech brokers have popularised, now supercharged by blockchain. The technology angle also adds benefits beyond fractional share sizes. Blockchain‑based stock tokens could be traded instantly, 24/7 (no waiting for stock exchange hours) and settle immediately, rather than enduring the typical multi‑day settlement cycle. This always‑on market means investors in different time zones aren’t left behind. It also means that if there’s breaking news at night, you could react immediately instead of waiting for the exchange to open next morning. Enhanced liquidity and improved price discovery are just part of the package. For emerging market investors, such a system could be a lifeline during volatile periods – allowing quick adjustments in response to local or global financial shifts. Beyond global giants, tokenised equities could help local businesses and startups raise capital. Traditional stock exchanges in frontier markets often have few listings and strict requirements. But imagine a promising local company issuing security tokens to the public as an alternative to an IPO. This would let the community invest in a local business easily. Essentially, it’s equity crowdfunding 2.0 on blockchain. For instance, a farmer’s cooperative in Indonesia could tokenise shares in their processing plant; villagers could buy tokens and collectively fund a project that also gives them ownership stake. It blends community finance with modern tech. From a bank’s perspective, tokenised equities might trigger some caution – questions about investor protection, custody, and compliance are real. However, they also represent an opportunity. Banks can act as custodians or issuers for these tokens, bridging trust by holding the underlying stocks and issuing tokens to customers. This approach, if paired with sound regulatory oversight, could bring the benefits of digital-native experiences to a broader investor base while preserving the stability of traditional systems. Livestock: From Pastures to the Blockchain Ledger Imagine a pastoral scene where cows and goats, long cherished as markers of wealth and social standing, are transformed into digital assets – tradable on a blockchain as easily as shares of a company. In many emerging markets, livestock isn’t just an asset; it’s a way of life. It’s used for dowries, as collateral, or as a store of value. Yet livestock is an illiquid asset – you can’t easily sell 1/10th of a cow when you need cash. Enter tokenisation. Pilot projects have shown that tokenising livestock can be both practical and beneficial. In Latin America, an innovative venture launched a token to fractionalise the revenue stream of a cattle ranch, effectively selling shares in the ranch’s output. Investors worldwide could buy tokens representing a small stake in the ranch, sharing in the proceeds when cattle are sold, all without ever touching a cow. This model enables farmers to raise capital without liquidating their herd and allows small investors to access an asset class traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Over in Argentina, a project called BitCow has taken a bold step by backing each token with a real, live cow. When you buy a BitCow token, you effectively own a stake in an actual cow managed by a farming company. As the cow produces calves, token rewards are issued to token holders – much like receiving dividends in the form of additional tokens. In regions where livestock represents a significant economic and cultural asset, such innovations can make the difference between exclusion and empowerment. Now picture similar ideas applied in Africa or Asia. In Kenya or Tanzania, owning cattle is a sign of wealth. A platform could allow local farmers to tokenise parts of their herds, letting investors from around the world purchase tokens equivalent to, say, one goat or a fraction of a cow. Farmers get much‑needed cash flow while token holders gain a tradable, fractional asset. This system could also facilitate novel insurance or lending mechanisms – a farmer might pledge livestock tokens as collateral for a loan, rather than risking the sale of the actual animal. Such models extend traditional practices of shared community livestock ownership into the digital age. Tokenising livestock also introduces greater transparency and oversight in sectors often marred by opaque records. With each animal tokenised and its history recorded on blockchain, stakeholders can verify health records, pedigree, and performance. This can improve food safety and attract more investment into agriculture – a sector vital to many emerging economies. The View from the Regulator’s Saddle (and the Banker’s Desk) No discussion of financial innovation would be complete without touching on regulation and the role of incumbent institutions. It’s understandable that the idea of freely trading tokens representing cows, condos, or company shares might initially raise eyebrows among regulators and bankers. Questions abound: How do we ensure tokens aren’t misused? What legal rights do token holders have? And how do we manage taxation and investor protection? The good news is that regulators in many regions are engaging with these questions. Controlled regulatory sandboxes in countries like Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia, and beyond are allowing fintech experiments under watchful eyes. This approach lets innovation proceed in a limited way to gather data, while containing risk. From a bank’s perspective, tokenisation isn’t a threat but an opportunity. Banks can partner with fintech companies to offer tokenised products, act as custodians, and even provide advisory services around digital assets. With proper frameworks and transparency, tokenisation can be integrated safely, unlocking new revenue streams and expanding financial inclusion. Embracing the Fractional Future In emerging markets, where the need for financial inclusion and efficient capital allocation is most acute, fractionalisation and tokenisation present a compelling way forward. We’ve seen how a single cow can be divided among many owners, or how a building can be owned by a thousand people. These aren’t just gimmicks – they reflect a future where finance is more inclusive, assets are more liquid, and innovation bridges cultural traditions with modern technology. For the everyday user, this means opportunity. Small investors can diversify and participate in economic growth like never before, whether it’s owning a bit of farmland in Latin America, a flat in an Asian metropolis, or a share of a thriving Nigerian business. For asset owners, it means new ways to unlock the value of what they hold without having to sell it all at once – transforming illiquid assets into spendable wealth incrementally. And for the broader economy, it means mobilising dormant capital into productive uses. There are, of course, challenges – technology risks, education gaps, and the need for robust trust frameworks. Yet emerging markets have a history of leapfrogging outdated systems, much like the success of mobile money in Africa. With the right approach, tokenisation and fractionalisation can do for asset ownership what mobile money did for financial inclusion. The future of finance might very well be fractional – a future where everyone, regardless of income or location, can own a piece of what builds our economy. And that’s a revolution worth embracing.

Title: Institutions Embrace Bitcoin While The UK Falls Behind

BySusie Violet Ward BySusie Violet Ward Contributor. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 29: People pass through the Bank area of the City of London on May 29, 2024 in ... More London, England. In recent months, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reportedly met with the boss of Shein, the Chinese-founded fashion retailer, to encourage the company to launch its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. London's reputation as a global financial hub has suffered in the wake of Brexit, compounded by an industry-wide slowdown in public offerings due to high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Photo by Carl Court The UK has a proud history of excellence and innovation in both financial services and in computer science. But its regulatory approach to bitcoin, which sits at the intersection between these disciplines, is undermining that position. The Financial Conduct Authority has created uncertainty, driven businesses offshore, and is damaging the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Regulatory uncertainty, restrictive policies, and a risk-averse approach have put the UK at a disadvantage as institutions elsewhere move forward. While other jurisdictions recognize Bitcoin’s role in institutional finance, UK regulators have created an environment that stifles progress. The Bitcoin for Institutions event, held recently in London at The Law Society, brought together investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to assess bitcoin’s growing significance. The consensus? The rest of the world is advancing while the UK remains stuck in bureaucratic inaction. Bitcoin for Institutions at The Law Society. Allen Farrington, co-founder of Axiom, a bitcoin-native investment firm focused on capital deployment in the bitcoin economy, captured the shift in institutional thinking. He described bitcoin as “forming the basis of a viable institutional asset class.” However, despite bitcoin being the best-performing asset of the decade, UK institutions remain hesitant. The FCA, tasked with ensuring financial stability, has instead become a barrier to innovation, and the result is that businesses have been driven out of the UK, driven out by regulatory hostility or simply deciding that the cost of compliance with poorly thought-out regulation is too high. While the UK stalls, the U.S. moves fast. One message was repeated throughout the event. Ignoring bitcoin is now seen as a career risk. https://x.com/Blockstream/status/1903109220393750840 In the U.S., pension funds, corporate treasuries, and asset managers are integrating bitcoin into their portfolios. In recent months, the largest buyers of bitcoin have not been retail investors or hedge funds, but institutional funds. Andrew Hohns, founder and CEO of Newmarket Investment Management, described the contrast, “Many U.S. companies have started incorporating bitcoin into their financial planning, and many others are well down the road. In the UK, institutional awareness of the benefits of bitcoin is more nascent, but the topic will move closer to center stage as corporate and sovereign game theory quickly take hold." Dominic Frisby summed up the cost of inaction: "Given the potential of bitcoin, and its record, the risk is not so much owning bitcoin as not owning it." In dialogue with Izabella Kaminska, Steve Baker, who served as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office until July 2024, commented on U.S. policymakers’ proactive stance, stating, “It’s great that the US is governed by a group of people who understand this.” In contrast, jurisdictions like the U.S., UAE, and Singapore are attracting capital by implementing frameworks that distinguish between bitcoin and speculative cryptoassets. The FCA has created a framework that treats bitcoin the same as speculative crypto tokens, ignoring its distinct characteristics as a decentralized monetary network. Adrian Cannon from Musqet pointed out this fundamental mismatch, "Bitcoin is revolutionary in ideas and concepts and that doesn’t fit within regulation and banking." Beyond the FCA’s misclassification of bitcoin, the UK’s broader regulatory structure is also a barrier to institutional adoption. Baroness Claire Fox, who sits in the House of Lords, told the audience about a recent government initiative called the Regulatory Innovation Office, which was implemented with the intention of reining in regulators. However, the reality is a system of self-replicating bureaucracy, as she described a quango of regulators where no one has accountability. This structure discourages innovation, shields regulators from scrutiny, and blocks new market entrants, creating a system that protects incumbents while deterring progress. While regulators insist their approach is about protecting investors, the reality is that businesses are being forced offshore, limiting choice and harming competitiveness. Beyond regulatory concerns, institutional adoption has also been slowed by misconceptions about bitcoin’s environmental impact. Discussions at the event highlighted how bitcoin is being used to stabilize energy grids, reduce waste, and improve sustainability. One panel on social benefits discussed bitcoin’s growing role in advancing financial inclusion and human rights - and the fintech products being built to enable this. In regions affected by financial repression, bitcoin is being used to bypass restrictions, support activist movements, and provide stable value transfer in fragile economies. In areas with poor access to banking, whether in sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, or refugee communities, bitcoin offers a way to receive donations, store value, and operate independently from centralised financial institutions. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 30: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of Bitcoin in London, ... More England. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, which has been in use since 2009. Photo illustration by Edward Smith Recent data indicates that over 50% of bitcoin mining is now powered by renewable energy sources. Miners are increasingly co-locating with wind, solar, and hydro projects, acting as flexible demand-response partners and absorbing excess energy when supply outpaces demand and powering down during peak consumption to relieve pressure on the grid. In the UK, this model could deliver substantial savings, especially given that electricity prices here are among the highest in the world. Reducing energy costs could offer a vital boost to both households and businesses facing mounting bills. According to the National Grid ESO, curtailment of wind power alone cost British consumers over £800 million in 2023, as renewable generators were paid to shut down during periods of oversupply, with the tab being picked up by households. If this curtailed energy were redirected to bitcoin mining, an approach already implemented in parts of the U.S., Scandinavia, and Africa, it would reduce these costs and provide an additional revenue stream for renewable operators. Instead of paying producers to switch off, excess energy could be monetised in real-time, and customers would see immediate savings on their bills. Bitcoin mining is also being used to capture vented methane from oil fields and repurpose landfill gas into electricity, turning environmental liabilities into economic opportunities. These developments challenge legacy thinking and position bitcoin as an energy solution. The discussion repeatedly returned to one key issue, namely that the UK is falling behind. While British firms continue debating whether bitcoin should be included in institutional portfolios, U.S. asset managers and corporate treasurers are already executing their bitcoin strategies. Dominic Frisby captured the financial risk of inaction, "The risk is not owning it." At the same time, institutional investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are increasing their exposure. In recent months, institutional funds have been the largest single buyer of bitcoin. This shift was largely due to BlackRock and Fidelity launching U.S.-approved bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, an institutional milestone that the UK has yet to match. What’s more, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in early March 2025 to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning bitcoin as a strategic asset within the U.S. financial system. ​ The tension between legacy finance and emerging alternatives was clear throughout the event, which was described as a clash between Wall Street and Main Street. The real risk for the UK is not that bitcoin will fail but that it will succeed elsewhere and leave the UK institutions scrambling to catch up. If the UK wants to remain a serious player in global finance, it needs to adapt before the next wave of innovation settles elsewhere. Baroness Claire Fox offered a blunt assessment of the current state of affairs and the path to change, “Rebellion is the way forward.” The Bitcoin for Institutions event clearly demonstrated an unavoidable truth: that UK institutions must act. Regulatory paralysis is not stopping bitcoin’s adoption. It is simply pushing progress elsewhere. While the U.S., UAE, and Singapore create supportive policies, the UK remains locked in bureaucratic complexity. Without a course correction, UK financial firms will be left behind in the next phase of institutional finance. Bitcoin is no longer an emerging trend, it is a financial transformation already in motion. And transformations do not wait for governments and regulators to catch up. This event was held under Chatham House Rule. All participants quoted in this article gave permission for their remarks to be used.

Title: Four in five workers in Ireland not aware of State’s auto-enrolment pension details

Four in five Irish workers are still not aware of the details of the incoming compulsory workplace pension regime just six months out from the launch date, according to a survey carried out by US investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock is understood to be among asset managers lining up a bid to manage part of the so-called auto-enrolment pension pot. The scheme will capture up to 800,000 workers between the ages of 23 and 60 and earning more than €20,000 who are not currently part of a pension plan, at the end of September. BlackRock’s 2025 Ireland Read on Retirement report also said that only 41 per cent of Irish workers feel they are on track for a reasonable standard of living on retirement. This falls to 26 per cent across individuals that do not have a defined contribution (DC) workplace pension. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment in the Republic of Ireland it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” said Tim Hodgson, of BlackRock’s UK & Ireland DC Platforms and Retirement Solutions. “Irish workers face similar challenges to those encountered by retirement savers around the world. The introduction of auto-enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.” The Department of Social Protection launched a long-delayed official search for three companies to manage the investment of contributions that will be made by employers, employees and the State into the auto-enrolment pot. Each will have to provide fund options of low, medium and high risk. Investment managers interested in the business have until April 7th to pitch for it. BlackRock is expected to compete alongside Amundi, Irish Life’s investment management arm, State Street Global Advisors and others for one of the three contracts. The “request for tender” document says that there may be €21 billion in assets under management in the My Future Fund – the name given to the auto-enrolment scheme – within 10 years. The document, filed on the Government’s eTenders website, sets a cap on any all-inclusive annual management charge of 0.1 per cent of the assets under management. Under auto-enrolment employers and employees will both contribute 1.5 per cent of their gross earnings to it initially, with the State adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions of all parties will gradually increase, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively by 2034. The BlackRock survey results reflect an international trend of poor retirement readiness. BlackRock’s UK Read on Retirement published in 2024 found that nearly three-quarters of UK DC pension savers feel they are not on track to achieve a reasonable standard of living in retirement while 60 per cent of workers who participated in a US study said they feared outliving their retirement savings.

Title: Sustainable investing the new standard

ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard. The strategy is considered sustainable, measuring environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact. Environmental factors can include carbon emissions, waste management and sustainability efforts. Social factors involve employee treatment, workplace diversity and community relations. Governance factors value leadership decisions, transparency and business ethics. With growing investor interest and regulatory support, ESG investing is becoming a mainstream approach to building sustainable and profitable portfolios. Research suggests ESG-focused investments often outperform traditional ones, offering competitive returns with less risk. At the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), ESG investment is being prioritised and support is provided to listed companies to align with international ESG standards. Many Thai listed companies received global ESG scores and emerged as industry leaders, recognised by S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025, which evaluates and awards companies for outperforming their peers in sustainability. GROWING POPULARITY Global ESG fund investments have been increasing, with assets under management now exceeding US$40 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Reports from Morningstar and MSCI indicate ESG funds tend to outperform conventional funds in the long term. During the pandemic, global ESG funds recovered more quickly than the overall market. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns. Sustainable businesses are more likely to survive and grow in the long term due to improved risk management in ESG aspects, according to these reports. Governments are introducing regulations on net-zero policies, carbon taxes and ESG standards, affecting companies that fail to adapt. Companies reliant on fossil fuels or lacking ESG policies may face rising costs due to fines, environmental fees, and higher energy costs. Institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Norges Bank emphasise ESG criteria and require companies they invest in to uphold clear sustainability standards. Recognising this trend, the SET supports Thai listed companies in enhancing sustainability. Soraphol Tulayasathien, senior executive vice-president and head of sustainable market development at the SET, said the bourse is driving ESG adoption among listed companies through various initiatives, including the development of the SET ESG Ratings and SET ESG Index. The SET utilises its ESG Ratings to compile the SET ESG Index, which has been published on the SET's website since Nov 6, 2023. The SET ESG Ratings are based on a voluntary sustainability assessment that evaluates companies across ESG dimensions. The assessment is reviewed annually to align with evolving sustainability trends at both global and national levels. To be included in the SET ESG Ratings, listed companies must score at least 50% in each ESG dimension and meet specific criteria, such as corporate governance reporting (CGR) quality, net profit performance, shareholder equity, and adherence to ESG-related compliance standards. Any companies failing to meet these criteria are excluded from the ratings. ESG IN THAILAND More than 100 Thai ESG funds manage some 30 billion baht in assets. Chavinda Hanratanakool, chairwoman of the Association of Investment Management Companies, said firms are encountering greater risks across the global business landscape. "ESG information will be an important tool investors should use to make investment decisions," she said. "Companies that take into account ESG issues can see their business risks reduced, while investors are also focusing on managing their risks." To serve the growing popularity of ESG investments and to prop up a struggling bourse, the government endorsed the Thai ESG Extra (ESG X) fund category last month, designed to encourage investment in sustainable and high-growth equities through substantial tax incentives. Investors can transfer existing holdings from long-term equity funds maturing this year, estimated at 180 billion baht, to Thai ESG X funds to qualify for a tax deduction of up to 500,000 baht. Investors can claim 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, with the remaining 200,000 baht available for deduction in subsequent years at 50,000 baht a year. New investments in Thai ESG X funds are also eligible for a separate tax deduction of 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, provided the units are purchased between May and June. The SET listed 242 stocks for inclusion in Thai ESG and Thai ESG X funds, consisting of 228 companies with SET ESG Ratings and 14 companies disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data. Whether other stocks can be included depends on the individual fund policies. The bourse announced Thai ESG X funds must invest at least 65% of net asset value in securities listed on the SET or Market for Alternative Investment that meet one of the three following sustainability criteria. First, securities that have a good SET ESG Rating or international ESG rating, such as from the FTSE Index or MSCI Index. Second, companies that disclosed greenhouse gas emissions data, and third companies that have a CGR score from the Thai Institute of Directors of at least 90 and disclosed data on at least 85% of their items on the SET ESG data platform. RATINGS BENEFITS Mr Soraphol said an ESG rating serves as a tool for improving sustainable business practices and risk management. Companies receive scores and recommendations in order to enhance their ESG performance, he said. ESG scores allow companies to compare their sustainability performance against peers, while companies gain visibility among sustainable investors, facilitating better access to capital, said Mr Soraphol. "An ESG credit rating benefits investors and analysts, providing a benchmark for comparing companies' ESG performance," he said. For analysts, the rating supports stock valuation and investment decision-making. In addition, the rating helps fund managers develop ESG-focused investment products, said Mr Soraphol. The rating also serves as a tool for investor engagement and corporate ESG advocacy, he said. In 2024, 228 listed companies clinched a spot on the SET ESG Ratings, echoing the growing wave of sustainable investments locally and globally. There are 242 listed companies on the list. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP S&P Global recently launched the Sustainability Yearbook 2025 to recognise top-performing companies in sustainability. The assessment is based on the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which evaluated 7,690 companies on economic and ESG factors. S&P global CSA scores range from 0 to 100 and categorise companies into the top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% globally: The top 1% comprises companies with the highest CSA scores worldwide. The top 5% covers companies ranking just below the top 1%. The top 10% comprises the highest-ranked 10% of companies in each industry. Beyond ESG stocks, investment themes such as climate change, green bonds and carbon credits are gaining traction. The SET partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group through FTSE Russell to enhance ESG assessments in Thailand, aligning SET ESG Ratings with global standards. The assessment methodology, which is used for more than 8,000 securities worldwide, ensures Thai listed firms can be benchmarked against global peers, strengthening investor confidence. A pilot assessment is planned for 2024-2025, with full public ESG score disclosure by 2026. NET-ZERO COMMITMENTS As the SET enters its 50th year, the bourse is driving sustainable capital market development and aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of these efforts, it is developing the SET Carbon system to disclose climate change management data about the capital market, aiming to enhance climate data disclosure and streamline corporate greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The first phase of SET Carbon is available to interested companies in the first quarter of this year. In collaboration with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the bourse is also integrating listed companies' energy consumption data. The SET recently obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognised authority on science-based target setting. The validated targets include a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050. With this distinction, the bourse becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets, alongside Bursa Malaysia, the Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group. "ESG investing is more than just an option, it is the new global investment standard," said Mr Soraphol. Investors prioritising ESG will unlock superior opportunities, while companies committed to sustainability will attract greater investor attention and achieve long-term growth potential, he said.
