John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Honeywell says that 20% of the company’s software code is written by GitHub Copilot and other AI-assistant coding tools. But, does that mean that the industrial giant’s embrace of AI has corresponded with a 20% reduction in that team’s workforce? No, according to Suresh Venkatarayalu, the chief technology officer and president of the company’s software-focused division, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. “What has changed is the type of developer skill sets,” said Venkatarayalu at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference held last week in Park City, Utah. With less time needed to write code, Honeywell’s software developers can perform more complex work, including spending more time in the field with customers to solve their system integration needs. For decades, the industrial sector has been embracing automation technologies that have made it easier to move goods across the factory floor, perform quality control inspections, and monitor machinery to predict when a fix may be in order before any breakdowns occur. Workers have also gotten more access to AI-enabled tools, helping recommend when supplies need reordering, predict demand from customers, and help handle repetitive back-office tasks. AI represents yet another new way to rethink manufacturing automation. Many are still early in their adoption journey, with only 29% using AI or machine learning at the factory or network level, and just one out of four having deployed generative AI at that scale, according to a survey of 600 executives from large manufacturing companies by consultancy Deloitte. Jaime Mineart, SVP and CTO of construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, joined Venkatarayalu during the panel discussion and shared leaders need to change how their workers engage with technology. That might include classes in prompt engineering, so they know how to get the most out of large language models, specialized training in how to work alongside robots, or lessons on how to glean insights from the data streaming from a more connected manufacturing ecosystem. “It’s huge change management,” Mineart said. The biggest challenges that they will need to solve will be related to both labor capability and labor availability, she added. Venkatarayalu sees things slightly differently. In the U.S. and other developed markets, he believes that there is a labor shortage. But in higher growth regions, the problem is more focused on the skills gap. “The only way to offset the labor shortage and a skills shortage is to augment with something, and that something is AI,” said Venkatarayalu. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers last year found that nearly 60% of manufacturers report that their inability to attract and retain employees is their top challenge. A separate study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute last year showed that 1.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs could go unfilled over a decade if the talent woes aren’t addressed. Meanwhile, the median tenure of a manufacturing worker has slipped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mineart said automation and AI can help move workers away from less safe, duller, and more repetitive tasks. “Those are jobs that robots, robotics, and technology can really do very, very well, alongside that human capability and that human creativity to get more productivity and safer work sites,” she said. Caterpillar and Honeywell share some similarities in that they are both over a century old and are on the Fortune 500 (Caterpillar at 64, Honeywell at 119). But their AI journeys are evolving in different ways. Honeywell, which is in the process of splitting itself into three different companies, has launched new generative AI features for customers including an AI assistant to automate tasks for operators and production workers and has inked partnerships with Google, Chevron, and Qualcomm to collaborate more on AI innovation. Caterpillar’s revenue is getting a boost from the data center boom that’s leading to stronger sales of the company’s generators. It has also pledged $100 million over the next five years to upskill workers on evolving technologies, including AI. “When you think about bringing manufacturing back into the United States, we have to reimagine how we are going to do that,” said Mineart. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Momentum continues to build for quantum. While the most promising advancements for quantum computing look to be at least a few years away, excitement for the developing field is accelerating as seen by a Wall Street Journal report last week that quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raised $1 billion from investors including BlackRock and Nvidia’s venture-capital arm to bring the company’s total valuation to $7 billion. There’s been quite a bit of funding action in the space in recent weeks, with Honeywell’s quantum computing company, Quantinuum, and Europe’s IQM Quantum Computers both disclosing funding rounds earlier this month. WSJ also separately reported on IBM’s efforts to lead in the space, which includes a partnership with chip maker AMD to develop “quantum-centric supercomputers.” Automation is more popular than augmentation for Anthropic’s Claude. Anthropic, the AI startup whose CEO warned that the technology could wipe out 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in five years, published a broad report this week that found that 77% of enterprises’ usage of Claude AI software was focused on automation, with just 12% for augmentation (which includes improved collaboration and learning). Peter McCrory, head of economics at Anthropic, told Bloomberg that it wasn’t clear whether the increase in automation was due to “new model capabilities that are expanding the set of things that get automated, or if it’s people being more comfortable with large language models and becoming more willing to delegate certain tasks to Claude.” As OpenAI spends big, questions begin to swirl on the startup’s monetization strategy. Wall Street cheered the news of Oracle’s $300 billion cloud deal last week, an OpenAI halo that’s also lifting the valuations of key investor Microsoft, AI chip maker Nvidia, and Broadcom, the latter seeing a stock pop after it was reported that OpenAI placed a $10 billion order for its custom AI chips. The thesis of all this investment is that enterprises and individual customers will spend on AI at exponentially higher rates than they are today, to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars that OpenAI is putting into AI infrastructure. That’s not necessarily a guarantee, with studies and surveys beginning to call into question the success of generative AI pilots and very few paying individual customers. While nearly two billion individuals use AI, only 3% of them are paying for premium services, which includes ChatGPT, according to a study by Menlo Ventures. AI skills are becoming a job requirement A report on the Group of 7 nations found that 78% of all tech roles now include at least some AI skills and that seven of the 10 fastest-growing tech roles are related to AI. The highest in-demand roles that saw the largest year-over-over growth are AI risk and governance specialist (234%), NLP engineer (186%), AL/ML engineer (145%), AI business consultant (134%), and AI infrastructure engineer (124%), according to a study published by the AI Workforce Consortium, a group of ten large employers that includes Google, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, and SAP. Beyond merely hiring new talent for those roles, AI Workforce Consortium is also advocating for more upskilling, saying that tech skills like prompt engineering, conversational AI, and generative AI require “immediate” intervention to cater to the job market demand. “I think there has been a gap, for quite some time, between higher education and corporations,” Fran Katsoudas, Cisco's chief people, policy and purpose officer, tells Fortune. Those gaps were initially focused on soft skills, including learning how to collaborate on a project or respectfully disagree. Now, corporations will need to take that same college-to-work skills gap playbook and apply it to AI. “Part of the challenge is when companies think about training or education, we make it very individualized,” adds Katsoudas. “Enterprise education has to be more team- and roll-based.” Courtesy of The AI Workforce Consortium Hiring: - Jefferson Center for Mental Health is seeking a CIO, based in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Title: End Quarterly Earnings Forecasts But Not Quarterly Reporting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2025/09/17/end-quarterly-earnings-forecasts-but-not-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T18:53:00Z

ByMichael Posner, Senior Contributor. President Donald Trump has proposed reducing the frequency of corporate financial reporting requirements from four reports a year to two. He made the same suggestion in 2018. Trump justifies this idea by saying, “This will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He is only half right: the reduced reporting will indeed save companies money. But at the same time, it will reduce transparency, denying investors, government regulators, and the public access to essential information that is of broad public concern. This is yet another example of the administration’s efforts to roll back data collection and dissemination on a wide range of topics. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required publicly traded companies to file quarterly financial reports since 1970. These reports provide a snapshot of financial performance, a collection of unaudited financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These numbers help investors assess a company's growth, profitability, and financial health. But in the wake of the president’s announcement, the SEC now says that it is prioritizing his proposal “to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.” This is the latest in a series of administration steps aimed at reducing government oversight of corporate actions. It’s important to separate the two different aspects of the corporate reporting process. The first is the role these reports play in generating data that investors use to make quarterly earnings forecasts. These forecasts reinforce the investment model for many on Wall Street, prioritizing the maximization of short-term shareholder profits at the expense of a company’s long-term value. Extending the reporting period from three to six months will do very little to correct this investor-driven short-termism, which disincentivizes C-suite executives who wish to invest in environmental and social safeguards. In 2018, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, which rightly called for the end to quarterly earnings forecasts. They wrote, “in our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.” But they also stressed that this “should not be misconstrued as opposition to quarterly and annual reporting.” Rather, they emphasized that, “[tr]ansparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets.” Dimon and Buffett are not alone in this assessment. FCLTGlobal, a non-profit that began as a joint initiative of BlackRock, McKinsey, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Fund, and others, also promotes longer-term thinking in finance. A report they published in 2017 argues that the publication of “[q]uarterly earnings remains essential in providing investors with the transparency they need and in keeping management teams accountable for their performance.” FCLTGlobal suggests that instead of reducing reporting requirements, companies should be encouraged to incorporate long-term goals in their public reporting and to discuss the progress they are making toward these goals each quarter. The second reason for doing these reports, called 10-Q filings, is to provide investors and the public with information on a range of topics that enhance corporate transparency and provide a measure of accountability. This is more important than ever in the current political moment, when the Trump administration is relaxing federal ethical standards and enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On their own, quarterly financial reports cannot reverse this current trend, but they can provide a hedge against the most egregious conduct. To paraphrase former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”10-Q reports are divided into two parts. The first includes financial statements, disclosures about market risks, analysis of the company’s financial situation by management, and discussion of its internal controls. These disclosures give individual and institutional investors the information they need to make informed investment decisions. The second part of these reports covers a range of other topics that helps investors and the public identify potential risks, such as whether there are legal or default proceedings pending against the company, or the unregistered sales of equity securities. Not surprisingly, this is information that company leaders often are not eager to disclose. Under the law, they must. This provides all of us with an important source of accountability. As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the President’s proposal is likely to meet resistance from investors. The Journal wrote, “Institutional investors such as pension funds and hedge funds typically crave more information on the companies they follow, not less.” And as T. Rowe Price has observed, even longer-term investors benefit from quarterly reports, “because these short-term progress reports increase our confidence in our ability to predict a company’s long-range outcome.” In an era of increasing corporate power and declining regulatory oversight, maintaining robust quarterly reporting requirements isn’t just good policy—it’s essential for market integrity and public accountability.

Title: Rick Rieder Overhauls BlackRock Bond Team as HPS Clout Grows

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is revamping its massive fixed-income division around new investment strategies and artificial intelligence, as the unit’s leveraged finance business moves under an executive team from the firm’s newly acquired HPS Investment Partners. The changes mark a new vision for the group and reflect the credit market’s “dramatic and transformative” evolution, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The move also underscores the growing clout of the private financing solutions group led by HPS’s top executives — a key business for the firm as it expands in private and alternative credit and competes with the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. BlackRock’s leveraged-finance business will remain under the stewardship of David Delbos and Mitch Garfin, but will be folded into the PFS business from global fixed income, according to the memo. The PFS franchise is overseen by Scott Kapnick, Scot French and Michael Patterson, the HPS leaders who completed the $12 billion sale of the private-credit specialist to BlackRock in July. A representative for the company declined to comment. It’s the latest move in a sweeping plan to re-wire BlackRock. Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink is staking a big part of his company’s future on private markets and his ability to combine them with the public stock and bond strategies and ETFs that have powered the firm’s rise. BlackRock has spent billions to become a major player in alternative and private assets and data, and the HPS purchase turned it into a private-credit behemoth nearly overnight. Rieder, who met last week with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the role of Federal Reserve chair, laid out new investment plans for BlackRock’s fixed-income group in the memo. It will build out core fixed-income portfolios and plans to develop a so-called core-plus-related solution that is “more powerful,” he said. As part of the changes, Rieder said Russ Brownback will become deputy CIO of global fixed income. David Rogal, meanwhile, has informed the company that he intends to explore opportunities outside the firm, Rieder said. Bank of America Corp.’s David Koh will join BlackRock in a newly created role as chief investment strategist, he added. Rieder’s group plans to start a fixed-income hedge fund dubbed TriaXial, he said. It also intends to develop a higher-income version of BINC, a popular active bond ETF with $12.3 billion in assets that Rieder manages. He is responsible for roughly $2.4 trillion in total, according to the firm’s website. “Technology will be a significant part of the work,” said Rieder. “The ability to use AI, machine learning and new data” will help develop new tools to improve investment returns. --With assistance from Laura Noonan and Jeremy Hill.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The world’s largest asset manager is exploring putting exchange-traded funds on chain, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Property prices rose in the 12 months to July this year, up 7.5pc compared to the same time a year ago, but the pace of increases has moderated. In the 12 months to the end of June, prices were up 7.9pc. The latest Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows the greatest slowdown was in Dublin. House prices in the capital were 6pc higher at the end of July than a year earlier, versus up 6.8pc in the 12 months to the end of June. The CSO Residential Property Price Index shows property prices outside Dublin were 8.7pc higher in July 2025 when compared with a year earlier, a slight decrease, from 8.8pc in the year to June 2025. Dublin city prices were up 7.7pc at the end of July. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which has some of the highest average prices anywhere, the pace of increase has moderated significantly, with a rise of 4.7pc in 12 months. However, double-digit price hikes are still being felt outside Dublin. House prices in the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) are up 10.9pc, and the Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) they rose 10.3pc. Both the South-East, which comprises Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) had an 8.1pc rise in house prices. 80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 17th Households paid an average price of €374,999 for a dwelling on the residential property market in the 12 months to July 2025, the CSO said. The region with the highest median price in the year to July was Dublin, with median prices of €490,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the average price was €675,000. The least expensive region within Dublin was Fingal at price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €451,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, the CSO said. The least expensive regions over the last 12 months were both Donegal and Leitrim, where the standard price paid for a dwelling was €195,000. In the year to July, the Eircode area with the highest price for household dwelling purchases was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin), with an average price of €795,000. The Eircode area with the least expensive median price within Dublin was D10 (Dublin 10), where the median price was €314,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was A98 (Bray, Wicklow), with a median price of €549,999. The least expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon), coming it at €150,000, the CSO said. The total value of dwelling purchases by households at market prices filed with Revenue was €2.1bn in July 2025, representing a 6.6pc increase compared with the €1.9bn worth of purchases in July 2024 and a 20.8pc increase compared with the €1.7bn worth of purchases in June 2025. “While the slight fall in the rate of annual house price growth will be welcomed by aspiring buyers, this is not unusual for the summer, often a quiet time for house sales,” said Trevor Grant, chairman of Irish Mortgage Advisors. “However, this easing could be short-lived and we could well see the rate of house price growth pick up for September and October, often busy months for house sales.” The price indices for new and existing dwellings are produced on a quarterly basis and at the national level only.

Title: Annual property price growth slips to 16-month low - CSO
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0917/1533940-cso-residential-property-prices/

Eleanor Burnhill Dublin City Council has said it is working with the Department of Housing, the Land Development Agency and Approved Housing Bodies to build as many homes as possible for first-time buyers and those on the housing waiting list. Assistant CEO for Housing at DCC Mick Mulhern said the council is "working to deliver as many homes as possible in the quickest time frame possible" and is now working across 100 different sites to deliver 12 thousand homes, which he said could take a number of years. He said of the 169 new homes launched today at Rathborne Crossing close to Ashtown station, DCC would take 86 of those. "There'll be social houses in one and two beds as part of this new development, which also includes a new creche and amenity space." It comes as residential property price growth slipped to a 16-month low of 7.5% in July, down from 7.9% in June, new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show. The CSO said that property prices in Dublin rose by 6% in July and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7% compared with the same month last year. Lord Mayor of Dublin Ray McAdam said there was a significant pipeline of development by Dublin City Council in terms of housing delivery taking place in the city at the present. "But obviously I fully acknowledge that we need to do more, and we are doing more." He said a decision would be taken before the end of this year in terms of reviewing who gets priority from the council's housing list. He said the Strategic Housing Policy Committee was looking at this. He acknowledged there were too many families and individuals experiencing homelessness and he said: "What we're working to do is to ensure that we ramp up supply, to ensure those, those families, have an opportunity to move in, into permanent accommodation." Reacting to the figures, the Minister for Housing James Browne said supply was key, but the Government was working to deliver as many homes as possible. "I'm very conscious that's a very significant increase. It is affecting affordability. "We need to get the apartments and the homes built. People need to be able to afford them, and that's why we're taking as many measures as we can. "But the key to getting house prices stabilised, and actually at an affordable price, is supply. That's why everything I've been doing for the first six months as Minister for Housing is making those key decisions, often difficult decisions, often decisions are being criticised, but they will actually deliver the supply that we need." In terms of numbers, he said there had never been a 50,000 target for delivery. "There won't be 50,000 this year, but it was never intended to be 50,000 homes this year. "What we want to see is an increase in the homes last year, and continue to build on the momentum that is there. In the last government we went from 19,000 homes to well over 30,000 homes actually in the lifetime of Housing For All, we actually exceeded the targets." 'Significant step change' - Browne Speaking today, Minister Browne said the government is starting from further behind this year in terms of delivering housing that would have been expected. He said he expected to see housing targets and delivery accelerate as the years go on but he would not be drawn on how many houses will be delivered by the end of this calendar year. "We accept there has to be a significant step change," he said. He said a little over 30,000 homes were delivered last year but the hope was that would have been higher. "That was a real disappointment and it does mean this year and in the near future we're probably starting from further behind what we would expect," he said. He said important decisions were being taken to accelerate delivery including making the country a national rent pressure zone, giving more security of tenure to tenants and what he hoped would be more certainty for international investors. "We need international finance to finance the construction sector in this country to deliver," he said. He said with the ebb and flow of construction, a few apartment blocks being completed in December, slipping into January could fundamentally change annual numbers. "I've never been in the business of forecasting but my business is to ensure we maximise every opportunity to deliver as many homes as possible." In terms of homelessness figures he said this was being looked at a granular level to look at the different reasons for it and trying to address those. Asked about a downturn in planning applications and comments from the Labour Party that he was seeking to blame local authorities for this, he said: "We've seen a 35% increase in building delivery in the second quarter. You're always going to have when you're dealing with something like building variations of commencements, planning, the delivery." He said he will keep an eye on looking at how more planning we can be accelerated working with the local authorities, ensuring they have the resources they need. "It also means having the land zoned that we need as well. "This is not about the blame game. This is about ensuring that we have the homes delivered where we need to build, the communities that everybody deserves," he said. Housing Activation office 'up and running' Minister Browne says the new Housing Activation Office will have a lead or a head, but will not have a housing 'tsar'. "All of the specialists from utility companies are now in place, and the specialists from the local authorities as well. "We are engaging with local authorities, writing out to them soon to identify the key areas. So that work is ongoing, and we will be identifying that lead. I don't give it any particular moniker, but it will have a lead, and we're making that final decision as to how exactly that would be implemented," he said. The CSO figures show that house prices in Dublin rose by 6.2% while apartment prices increased by 5.3%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Dublin City at 7.7% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 4.7%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.7% and apartment prices rose by 7.5%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) at 10.9%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) both saw increases of 8.1%. The median price of a home bought in the 12 months to July 2025 was €374,99, the CSO added. Today's figures show that the highest median price for a home in the 12 months to July was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €195,000 in both Donegal and Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area in July was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €795,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the lowest price of €150,000. Today's CSO figures also show that a total of 4,712 home purchases were filed with Revenue in July, a decrease of 0.2% when compared with the 4,723 purchases in July last year. The total value of transactions filed in July was €2.1 billion - made up of 3,567 existing homes with a value of €1.5 billion, and 1,145 new homes with a value of €550.7m. Today's figures mean that Dublin residential property prices are 6.8% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 23% higher than their May 2007 peak.

Title: Altcoin season’s here. These three drivers are seen to fuel the rally

About us Copy link Altcoin season has arrived. It kicked off earlier in September as 75% of the top 50 coins had performed better than Bitcoin over the past 90 days, according to Blockchain Center, the crypto data company. The list excludes stablecoins. The term altcoin season refers to a period when cryptocurrencies that aren’t Bitcoin outpace the biggest crypto when it comes to upside price action. The rotation from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies will accelerate from here thanks to booming corporate treasuries, cheaper capital and regulatory tailwinds, analysts say. Shane Molidor, founder of crypto investment bank and advisory firm Forgd, told DL News that the cyclical nature of Bitcoin and altcoin markets means investors “will likely rebalance incrementally, allocating capital to altcoins.” The comments come as Bitcoin has dominated this cycle with roaring record prices and hype on Wall Street. Investors have ploughed almost $10 billion into Bitcoin exchange-trading funds so far this year, according to SoSoValue. Those funds are run by the likes of investment behemoth BlackRock. Yet, the top crypto’s dominance has slumped by almost 6% over the past six months to take up 58% of the $4 trillion market, according to TradingView. At the same time, CoinMarketCap’s alt season index is at 71, up from just 44 last month, while Coinglass’ tracker reached 80 out of 100, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum. The data seemingly punctures hedge fund managers’ assumption that Bitcoin will dominate the market for some time yet. Here are the top three drivers behind the altcoin rally. The altcoin bullishness comes as the US Federal Reserve is set to slash interest rates on Wednesday. Investors see an interest rate cut as all but certain, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That will inject fresh liquidity into the global financial system. Lower borrowing costs incentivises investors to bet on risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, which tend to pump their prices. As risk appetite grows, “we are likely to see a drill-down approach, whereby the top-ranking layer 2 and ecosystem tokens by TVL, volume, and protocol revenue become prime candidates for [treasury] inclusion,” Molidor said. While most traders are betting that the US central bank will slash borrowing costs by 0.25%, there is a small chance that it goes even deeper with a 0.5% cut. A bigger cut may trigger “a significant rally in crypto since no one is truly expecting it,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV global, said in comments shared with DL News. Crypto treasury companies have emerged as leverage engines of this cycle, sucking in billions in institutional capital. By issuing debt and buying crypto, digital asset treasuries, or DATs, create a reflexive flywheel for price action, Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, said. Annabelle Huang, founder of execution layer Altius, told DL News that momentum behind altcoin treasuries “will likely continue for high quality altcoins with sustainable revenue, at least as long as the DATs themselves have a sound structure, and continue to have access to cheap funding.” Treasury firms are likely to pick tokens from battle-tested blockchains with sustainable tokenomics, an active ecosystem, and healthy user metrics, Huang argued But “momentum will fizzle quickly for firms that don’t meet these two requirements,” she added. The alts most likely to benefit from treasury firms seeking to capture extra upside are household-names like “Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Sui, along with their top performing ecosystem tokens,” Molidor said. Last week, crypto got its biggest endorsement yet from the US government. Paul Atkins, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declared that “crypto’s time has come” and vowed to end years of hostility from the oversight agency. The SEC’s Project Crypto initiative “will clarify that most crypto tokens are not securities, create a unified regulatory umbrella for trading, lending, and staking platforms,” dispelling years of controversy on altcoins. The agency is currently reviewing more than 90 exchange-traded products, including altcoin applications for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. The SEC’s decision deadline for several of those applications begins in mid-October, with analysts like Balchunas predicting high approval chances for major altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Some of those deadlines have been moved to mid-November. The SEC’s commitment to creating more crypto rules comes on the back of US President Donald Trump’s embrace of digital asset and him championing pro-industry policies. For a full-scale altcoin rally like in past cycles, both profit rotation and confidence are key, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. “Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively,” he said.

Title: Drama at the Fed has CEOs worrying about the health of its reputation

She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. I remember the days when a raised eyebrow from Ben Bernanke would spark hours of debate over the then Fed chair’s mindset about the state of the economy. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, bragged about learning to “mumble with great incoherence.” The model of the inscrutable U.S. central banker illustrated the power and prestige of the Fed, evoking a need to be flexible and deflect any market reaction to anticipated interest rate shifts that might not come to pass. Fast forward to today and, as one Fortune 500 CEO told me this week, “it’s a circus over there.” Later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce the central bank’s first interest rate cut since December. In discussions this week, I casually asked some leaders about what they thought the Fed might do. Their reaction was quite different from the days of yore. There was concern about the Fed’s ability to manage inflation and maintain a stable financial system. “They didn’t act fast enough on inflation under Biden and they’re not acting fast enough on a shift in the labor market under Trump,” observed one. This moment feels particularly fraught. There is, of course, the hope that a 0.25 percentage point cut might boost consumer confidence, corporate spending, homebuying, investing, hiring, and all the other good things that lower interest rates are meant to do. The challenge for leaders there, is that there are so many other variables creating volatility in those areas, from tariffs to technology. But recent drama at the Fed has made some leaders worry about the health and reputation of the institution itself. President Trump has threatened to fire Powell, unsuccessfully tried to oust Governor Lisa Cook on unproven allegations of fraud, and appointed White House advisor Stephen Miran (who Fortune profiled back in May) as a governor earlier this week while continuing to push the Fed to cut rates. If there is a rate cut, the President could claim victory, making “the credibility of the Fed further erode.” Most of the leaders I spoke to thought the best time to assess the impact of all this may not be today, but rather in the days and weeks ahead. One common belief that I certainly share in this climate: Bond yields, stock prices, hiring, borrowing, buying or any other metric may not move in a predictable pattern, no matter what the Fed decides to do. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump defamation lawsuit has “no merit,” NYT says The New York Times responded to Trump’s lawsuit against the paper by saying, “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.” The suit—which you can read here—claims the paper tried to influence the 2024 election by, among other things, publishing an article which said, “[i]t is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump.” Trump vowed to crack down on “The Radical Left Media”: “We are going to stop them at each and every level!!!” White House considering plan to label opponents as “terrorists” The Trump administration is considering a plan to designate non-profit organizations that oppose the president as terrorist organizations, a classification that would automatically revoke their tax-exempt status, the NYT reports. George Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation are two institutions under scrutiny. Firings continue for employees who comment on Charlie Kirk A number of high-profile figures have been fired for their comments following the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, and the list is rapidly growing across industries. The wave of terminations is causing employers to reconsider how much they want to regulate employees' opinions as instances of political violence accrue.

He arrives bearing a coterie of deals, worth multiple billions according to CNBC, from companies including BlackRock, Alphabet, and Blackstone, in addition to a series of new energy partnerships that include nuclear power. TikTok ban deadline moved to December 16 Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration has extended the deadline for TikTok to reach a deal that would offload its U.S. operations from its Chinese parent. Potential buyers include a consortium including Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake Management. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to discuss the deal later this week. Under Armour CEO’s defense of micromanagement Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is unapologetic about supporting micromanagement, calling the leadership style “underrated” and insisting that “the right answer will save us a lot of time.” Plank said in a recent YouTube interview that he wants his relationships with employees to reflect the relationship between him and his young adult children, based on mutual accountability and “modeling the behavior that I expect from my teammates to live by.” Epstein contact book released The House Oversight Committee released a tranche of new documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case, including the late billionaire sex offender’s contact book.

Title: OpenAI is giving its nonprofit $100 billion. Critics aren't convinced.

Time Published: 2025-09-17T09:00:01Z

Critics aren't convinced by OpenAI's latest restructuring plan. OpenAI said last week it will hand its nonprofit over $100 billion in stock, or 20% of the company's latest $500 billion valuation. It's part of the artificial intelligence giant's plan to restructure itself — it is technically a nonprofit, not a startup — so it can raise billions more from investors. Dozens of civil society groups, which want to ensure the benefits of AI are spread in the public interest, say they're pressuring regulators to protect OpenAI's nonprofit mission. They argue the nonprofit isn't fully independent from OpenAI and that $100 billion might even be a lowball given the company's prior commitments. These critics' voices matter because they're driving the pressure on California and Delaware regulators to keep investigating OpenAI over its restructuring. OpenAI's ability to do so and thus secure billions in new funding hinges in part on the outcome of this probe. As OpenAI inches toward its new structure, it's also racing against the clock. Its complex structure has already prevented it from reaching many potential investors, and the funding it secured is conditioned on near-term structural changes, it said in a letter this May. OpenAI stood behind its nonprofit's independence in comments to Business Insider. It also said that its existing nonprofit will remain in control of its for-profit entity as part of any changes. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings is looking into the $100 billion giveaway as part of her investigation into OpenAI. "We look forward to examining the details of this agreement as part of our continued review of OpenAI's plans, in keeping with our ongoing responsibility to safeguard the interests of its public beneficiaries," she said in a statement to Business Insider. California's attorney general declined to comment as OpenAI is under an active investigation. Advocacy groups have called for regulators to keep OpenAI true to its charitable mission, with over 50 joining a coalition called EyesOnOpenAI. They say that OpenAI's nonprofit isn't truly independent from the company, especially since the board members who briefly ousted CEO Sam Altman in November 2023 were replaced. The nonprofit's $100 billion stake doesn't fix that fundamental problem, in their view. "This setup risks perpetuating the problematic dynamics we have seen, essentially putting the foxes in charge of the henhouse," said Judith Bell, chief impact officer of the San Francisco Foundation. Orson Aguilar, CEO of LatinoProsperity, a lead member of the EyesOnOpenAI coalition, agreed. "The major question is whether the nonprofit is truly independent, and OpenAI has not announced any new mechanism or guardrails to ensure the public of that," he said. OpenAI's nonprofit board has operated as a "rubber stamp" since November 2023, progressive advocacy group Public Citizen said in a Friday letter, flagging the presence of Altman and corporate figures like BlackRock senior managing director Adebayo Ogunlesi for appearing to further "a for-profit mission." To resolve this, EyesOnOpenAI called on regulators in June to transfer most of OpenAI's charitable assets to a new, independent nonprofit. OpenAI told Business Insider that its nonprofit board is made up of eight independent directors alongside Altman and fully focuses on the mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. A $100 billion stake would turn OpenAI into one of the largest charities in the world. Some say it may not be enough. OpenAI's nonprofit should be entitled to almost all of OpenAI's earnings, not just 20% of them, says Tyler Johnston, executive director of The Midas Project, another group keeping the pressure up on regulators. "OpenAI once said that if they are successful, the vast majority of the money they ever earn will go to the nonprofit. So now, only offering them 20% seems like a downgrade," he told Business Insider. OpenAI said in 2019 that "any excess returns" — past a capped return for investors — would go to its nonprofit to ensure the benefits of AGI are widely spread. In May, OpenAI scrapped its capped profit model due to the rise of many other "great AGI companies." "This is not the time to step off the gas," Johnston said. OpenAI subpoenaed The Midas Project and Johnston earlier this month, accusing the watchdog of being funded by billionaire Elon Musk, who challenged OpenAI's restructuring in a lawsuit. Johnston denies the claims and says it's part of OpenAI's campaign to silence critics. OpenAI told The San Francisco Standard it's seeking transparency. Correction: September 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misquoted Tyler Johnston. The story has been updated to clarify that he said that offering OpenAI's nonprofit 20% "seems like a downgrade." Jump to

Title: Loverdos, K.M.’s promise and the “ready Nikos,” the approaches within ND & Samaras, National Bank and Piraeus Bank for the Ethniki Asfalistiki, the City meeting
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/09/17/loverdos-k-m-s-promise-and-the-ready-nikos-the-approaches-within-nd-samaras-national-bank-and-piraeus-bank-for-the-ethniki-asfalistiki-the-city-meeting/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T07:04:17Z
Full Content:
Hello, I’ll start with yesterday’s main political news: Andreas Loverdos joining New Democracy (ND). Loverdos has always been a centrist, moderate, low-profile politician who, wherever he served as a PASOK minister, left behind good impressions and some tangible results — how much or how little is subjective. He was terribly persecuted by the gang of his political opponents as well as common fraudsters in the Novartis case, but was acquitted only a short while ago. Obviously, ND had been waiting for his final acquittal before taking him in, but I have this question (and maybe you share it too): why in today’s PASOK — which is struggling at 12–13% and has lost dozens, if not hundreds, of capable centrist figures to ND — was there no room for Loverdos? What pushed him away? Because honestly, I don’t see any major ideological differences between ND and PASOK. Was it that “ready-Nikos” (Androulakis) didn’t want him? Did Loverdos seem superfluous? I don’t know where he will run or what luck he’ll have (though we wish him well), but compared to many we see and hear in PASOK today, Loverdos is in a different class altogether as a politician. And here’s a bit of info: two weeks ago, K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) had discussed Loverdos’ entry into ND directly with him and had promised it would go forward as soon as his court case was closed — and so it happened. “Bloodbath” in the South Loverdos’ addition to ND’s ballot in the Southern Athens Constituency really shakes up the deck. That’s where six ministers are elected (Dendias, Theodorikakos, Kyranakis, Spanakis, Theocharis, Anna Karamanli), two MPs (Kallianos, Voultepsi), plus two newcomers elected in May 2023 (Gaitanis, Gelefstathis). Also rumored: Stavros Papastavrou, former MEP Stelios Kympouropoulos, and Nikos Romanos had already announced his candidacy. In short: chaos. Taking it easy with Samaras As we approach elections, and given that Mitsotakis holds the lead in the polls at around 30% — double that of PASOK — he will increasingly try careful approaches on several… thorny outstanding issues (how more delicately can I put it?). For example: Maximos Charakopoulos as group representative in Parliament, showing up at Evripidis Stylianidis’ book presentation, and the next day at Patelis’ book. I asked about Samaras and the source replied: “That issue with President Antonis is delicate, sensitive, and very personal. K.M. wants to handle it himself with great care.” Without any extra info, I think the Mitsotakis–Samaras relationship within ND will now be approached very differently — led personally by the PM. KYSEA–Belharra Today’s KYSEA meeting (11:00) will be interesting, with focus on the migrant flow toward Gavdos and Crete’s southern coast. Plevris says that in the last two months alone, there have already been 1,500 deportations and voluntary returns. Also on the agenda: the likely “green light” for procurement of the 4th Belharra frigate, with Greece exercising the option included in the contract. Let’s see if in tonight’s ANT1 interview, K.M. says anything more about it. Normalization with Eugenios After some stormy months with the Church of Crete, yesterday’s meeting between K.M., Archbishop Eugenios, and Governor Arnaoutakis marked a “thaw” and gradual normalization. However, what was emphasized inside the meeting — reportedly held in a good atmosphere — is that the government will not withdraw the amendment regarding the immovability of the Metropolitan of Kydonia and Apokoronas, particularly Amphilochios of Kissamos. On the other hand, K.M. is said to have encouraged Eugenios to move forward with the person of his choice and close this divisive matter. London, Kikilias, and the Greek shipowners of the City As part of “London International Shipping Week,” Minister of Shipping Vassilis Kikilias was in London. On this occasion, Greek Ambassador to the UK Giannis Tsaousis hosted a dinner at the embassy residence in his honor. Among the 50 guests were prominent Greek shipowners in the City. First and foremost, Haralambos Fafalios, president of the Greek Shipping Cooperation Committee (known simply as “the Committee”), which this year celebrated 90 years of strong presence and remains a steady pillar of institutional advocacy and strategic support for Greek shipping. Also present: Dr. Nikos Tsakos (third vice president), Diamantis Lemos, Nikolaos Empeirikos, and members of the Mavroleon, Tsavliris, and Kerdos families, among others. In his speech, Kikilias promised reforms to reduce bureaucracy in registering ships under the Greek flag and to make the registry more competitive. To 6+4 of Hatzidakis to investors At yesterday’s Athens International Investor Summit organized by the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations in collaboration with Blackrock, Vice President Hatzidakis (who had also taken the legislative initiative for the establishment of the Innovation and Infrastructure Fund with a “dowry” of 300 million), presented 6 comparative advantages of Greece to investors and 4 possible investment sectors. The 6 advantages are the high returns due to the investment gap, macroeconomic stability, the geoeconomic advantage (single European market and central position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa), the inflow of funds from the EU, the business-friendly government, political and institutional stability. As for the 4 sectors, beyond shipping, tourism, the food industry and pharmaceuticals, he mentioned energy, networks, defense and higher education. Let’s see the response. Countdown for National Bank – Negotiations with Piraeus Bank Let’s now move to other market matters starting with the National Bank, for which the column predicts it will play a leading role in banking developments in the second half of September. The column reports that intensive negotiations are currently underway between National Bank and Piraeus Bank to resolve their Gordian knot of bancassurance. The information is that there should be no doubt that the issue will be resolved and each bank will go its own way. Simultaneously with the agreement, National Bank is cutting the umbilical cord with National Insurance, as the always silent, never hasty and by nature cautious P. Mylonas is running a process for the acquisition of 20% of an insurance company with which it will work on bancassurance once it is freed from the ties of National Insurance and, by extension, Piraeus Bank. The column’s information is that the selection process of the insurance company that will be the new partner of NBG is advanced, and barring surprises the news will come before the end of the month. Five insurance companies are participating in the process, since the prize of exclusive cooperation with National Bank is coveted in the insurance market, especially after the reshuffling caused by the acquisition of Piraeus Bank. This also explains the participation of five insurance companies and is the reason for the confusion that arose among us journalists, with each one writing down a different company name — I suppose because each candidate company leaked the name of the competitor it feared. I stop here therefore and list the insurance companies taking part in the “marriage” process with National Bank, which are: Munich Re (ERGO), Alliance, NN, Interamerican and one more. The blitzkrieg deal of Credia Bank And if National Bank will take center stage in the coming days, Credia Bank is already in the spotlight today with its acquisition of HSBC Malta. There are two points of interest: The first is the price, since the market expected a price of 300 million and not 200 million. The second is the blitzkrieg deal achieved by Credia, as the Greek bank expressed interest in late July – early August stating that its offer would be valid for 15 days and that it wanted a direct and straightforward deal. On 15/8 the non-binding offer was submitted and on 16/9 the agreement was announced. Today the CEO of Credia Bank, E. Vrettou, speaks to analysts and will provide an official picture of the strengthening of ratios and figures. According to information, she will mention that the assets of the new bank will exceed 15 billion euros and – according to management’s estimate – the final recurring profitability of Credia Bank will be strengthened by approximately 90-100 million euros annually. The Czech’s investment in Box Now Emma Capital of Czech billionaire Jiri Smejc, known from its years-ago investment in OPAP, continues to maintain an investment presence in Greece and one of its investments, Box Now, seems to have paid off very quickly. The company, founded in 2021, has evolved into the largest player in the domestic smart locker market, attracting the attention of PCP, the investment arm of Olympia Group, which acquired a 12.5% stake in Box Now. Based on the published financial statements, the company’s turnover skyrocketed last year to 15.3 million euros from 2.9 million euros in 2023, a result of the rapid expansion of its smart locker network and the commercial agreements it secured. The investments being made affected the bottom line of the balance sheet, with losses at 5.8 million euros, reduced from the 8.6 million euros of the previous year. The investment for the development of Box Now so far exceeds 42 million euros and continues to expand throughout the country, with emphasis on island Greece. Emma Capital’s plan now also includes neighboring markets, and thus the until recently CEO of Box Now Greece, Dimitris Andriotis, has taken on duties as Group CEO for Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Croatia, with the goal of faster growth in these countries. The Chinese secretary coming to Greece, the Americans and Piraeus From the Chinese embassy came into the dark room the information that “according to Xinhua News Agency, Li Xi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, will make official friendship visits to Greece and Belarus from September 17 to 24, 2025. The visits will take place at the invitation of the New Democracy party of Greece and the Presidential Office of Belarus.” It will be interesting to see if the issue of the port of Piraeus will be discussed, which has been “targeted,” along with other Chinese-owned ports, by Washington, because it is located at a strategic point amid geopolitical turbulence. All the more so now, with tensions in Gaza at boiling point. COSCO has denied that its port units, which are on the U.S. blacklist, are related to the Chinese military, and insists its operations continue normally. The Greek side states it has no official information. Among the ports targeted by Washington are those in which China holds significant stakes, such as in Panama, but also in Europe – particularly in Greece and Spain – as well as ports on the U.S. West Coast and in parts of the Caribbean. There is concern at the Big Port. And the point is that when buffaloes fight, the frogs pay the price. Orgasm in Golden Visa issuances of commercial properties The plan is simple: We buy an old and abandoned commercial property (an old workshop, a small factory, a large retail store, etc.) in a neglected corner of Athens. We convert it into a residential property and thus obtain a Golden Visa without paying €800,000, since €250,000 is enough according to the law. The change of use from commercial or industrial property to residential constitutes a golden “way out” for those who wish to acquire a residence permit through the Golden Visa, with the only prerequisite being the completion of the conversion before the application. Information indicates that only in the first 7 months of 2025, only in Athens, a total of 17,254 Golden Visas were issued (+31.4% increase compared to 2024). This number concerns residence permits through real estate investment, with the greatest interest coming from citizens of Turkey, China and Israel. In July 2025 alone, 932 new Golden Visas were issued, marking the largest monthly increase of the last twelve months. The forgotten commercial properties of the capital come to life, their neighborhoods change appearance, the wider area comes to life. In August there was a slowdown due to summer holidays, but in September the surge continues. The green maneuvers of Greek shipowners I wrote in early September about the holistic green transition of shipping which the International Maritime Organization (IMO), led by Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, wants to achieve by 2028. The effort is disjointed, the targets are considered unattainable and the most important thing is that there are no alternative fuels with zero CO2 emissions in production! The whole thing is in the realm of absurdity. Those who will not use such fuels will pay a tax into a special fund per ship and per carbon emission. And the question is where the large amounts collected will be channeled. The issue was raised by Vassilis Kikilias in the meeting he had the day before yesterday with Arsenio at the IMO headquarters in London. He told him that the IMO Net-Zero Framework requires corrective adjustments, since the lack of green fuels requires more realistic timelines, fair treatment of transitional fuels – such as LNG – as well as smart use of the reward mechanism. But the game seems lost. In fact, leading the international resistance against the IMO is none other than Donald Trump. Let’s see what we will see this coming October when everything will be played at the highest level. Meanwhile, Greek shipowners, faced with this Gordian knot, chose a middle-ground solution which has an expiration date. What did they do and what are they doing? They install scrubbers on their ships, reducing greenhouse gas emissions through filtering, until they see where things are going. According to analysts, about 900–1,000 Greek-owned ships are equipped with scrubbers, representing about 22% of the total. The main dilemma for Greek shipowners is how to make use of the existing investments in scrubbers at a time when the market is shifting to LNG, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen and biofuels. In short, their lines got crossed. Stock Exchange: Out of strength Not for a single moment of yesterday’s stock market session was there buying interest to bring the General Index into positive territory. It started with Coca Cola HBC (-2.42% at €42) which from the beginning of the session was losing €1 from its price. Immediately after, the systemic banks followed. It is characteristic that since Monday, August 25, when the sideways downward movement of the General Index began, the 4 systemic banks have been losing ground, but the non-systemic ones are gaining what the others lose. Logically tomorrow, an upward reaction of the systemics is possible, since technical analysis dictates that the Banking Index should not stray from yesterday’s closing at 2,202 points. In any case, the Banking Index – even today – records gains of +71.29%, a fact that allows not only the securing of profits but also rotation within the sector. Yesterday’s transaction value exceeded €183 million with €27.22 million in blocks, while the General Index ended the session at 2,033.23 points, with daily losses of -1.18%. It is a period of wars and geopolitical concerns, with turmoil in the debt market and currency shifts. In Greece, on Friday the September derivatives for indices and shares expire and the restructuring of the FTSE Russell and Stoxx indices is completed. The same day, late Friday night, Moody’s will publish its verdict on Greek creditworthiness, without particular expectations for surprises. With an “Italian scent” the pressures on bank shares Bank shares were in the crosshairs of sellers on the Athens Stock Exchange, as they were swept along by the “wave” of liquidations that hit banks across Europe. The source of the problem was Italy, where the Meloni government plans to burden the domestic sector with €3 billion over two years. With losses of 2.4% responded Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca followed at -2.2%, Unicredit fell by 1.4%, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena moved lower by 2.8%. Some of Europe’s big banks reacted with even stronger liquidations. In Germany, Deutsche Bank slipped 3.3% and Commerzbank sank 4.2%. In France, Societe Generale led the losses at 3.7%, while BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole reacted more calmly with a decline of 1.7%. In Britain, Barclays fell 2.6%, Standard Chartered 2.3% and HSBC 1.2%. Spanish banks Banco Santander, Caixabank and Banco de Sabadell also lost more than 2%. Franchise agreements in Greek hotels All over Greece, old hotel units and complexes are signing franchise agreements with major foreign tourism groups, changing their appearance and offering a completely new product. International chains such as Hilton, Marriott, Accor, Wyndham and Radisson have already dynamically expanded their networks in the country. Already 50% of seasonal hotels have signed contracts for 2025 while 34% of them follow the commitment franchise model, committing 56% of their rooms at prices 8% higher compared to 2024. The new franchise deals concern acquisitions and upgrades of five-star units, such as the Golden Milos Beach in Milos by Domotel, or Radisson which is investing strongly in emerging destinations such as Mani. With these agreements, the quality of services and the equipment of the hotels are upgraded, while new tourist destinations are highlighted (e.g. Mani, Karpathos, Argolis). Franchise is evolving into a key driver of restructuring of our hotel market, upgrading the product and reducing the risk of overconcentration in Athens and the islands. In the age of over-optimism The latest available data show that 45.4% of American households have invested their savings in stocks. Even in the era of the big Dot.com “bubble” in 2000, the corresponding percentage was 38%. At a time when the S&P 500 Index is soaring to record levels, housing prices are at record levels, gold has broken every previous record, bitcoin is at unprecedented levels, American households are basing their prosperity on the expectation of continuous price increases. The “AI Euphoria” of recent years has outperformed the Telecom Bubble, even the Railway Mania of the 19th century. The latest Bank of America survey of fund managers (FMS) showed that the overwhelming majority of them believe that stock markets are overvalued. Yet they continue to invest, following the old saying of Chuck Prince of Citigroup: “as long as the music is playing, you have to dance.” …and suddenly Goldman Sachs “sees” gold at 5,000 dollars Goldman Sachs’ main estimate is that gold will reach 3,700 dollars by the end of the year. Suddenly, however, it put forward the forecast that gold could soar up to $5,000/ounce if the credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve is shaken. Even if a small percentage (just 1%) of the private U.S. Treasury market shifts toward gold due to uncertainty, these flows are enough to drive the precious metal’s prices to unprecedented heights. Goldman Sachs estimates the total value of privately held Treasury market portfolios at about 57 trillion dollars. Therefore, such a shift by private investors toward the safe haven equates to an additional $570 billion in demand in the gold sector. In practice, the gold market is much smaller in size, so “overshooting” is quite likely. The political questioning of the Fed by President Trump and concerns over the independence of monetary policy constitute déjà vu for investors who historically turn to gold when they fear dollar devaluation or accelerating inflation. Many central banks are expected to increase gold purchases, preparing for possible monetary shocks. Explore related questions

Title: UK, US agree £31 billion tech pact to mark Trump's visit

Time Published: 2025-09-17T06:53:16Z
Full Content:
Britain and the US have agreed a technology pact to boost ties in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy, with top US firms led by Microsoft pledging £31 billion ($42 billion) in UK investments. The "Tech Prosperity Deal" is part of US President Donald Trump's second state visit to Britain, which will include a day of pomp at Windsor Castle today, hosted by King Charles and the royal family. Britain said the pact included joint efforts to develop AI models for healthcare, expand quantum computing capabilities and streamline civil nuclear projects. It added that it would support economic growth, scientific research and energy security in both countries. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal had the potential to shape the future of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and deliver growth and security. The US is Britain's single largest country trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their UK operations. Starmer, under pressure to reverse years of weak economic growth, now wants to pitch Britain as a destination for further investment by opting for the light touch regulation favoured by the US in areas such as AI, as opposed to the more interventionist approach of the European Union. The Trump administration has criticised European online safety laws and digital taxes, including those in Britain, but they were not part of the discussions over the pact. Under the deals announced, chipmaker Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 graphics processing units across Britain - its largest rollout in Europe to date. It is working to deploy up to 60,000 Grace Blackwell Ultra chips with UK-based Nscale, which will partner OpenAI in a UK leg of the US company's giant Stargate project and tie-up with Microsoft to establish Britain's largest AI supercomputer. Microsoft said it would invest £22 billion in total to expand cloud and AI infrastructure as well as in the supercomputer, which will be in Loughton, north-east London. Satya Nadella, chair and CEO of Microsoft, said it wanted to ensure that America remained a trusted and reliable tech partner for Britain. Its president, Brad Smith, said relations had improved hugely since the "dark days" before the UK's antitrust regulator dropped its opposition to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, saying he felt "enormously better". David Hogan, vice president for enterprise at Nvidia, told reporters the investments would "truly make the UK an AI maker, not an AI taker". Google announced a £5 billion investment, including a new data centre in Waltham Cross, north of London, and continued support for AI research through its DeepMind project. Cloud computing firm CoreWeave said its £1.5 billion backing would fund energy-efficient data centres in partnership with Scottish firm DataVita, bringing its total UK investment to £2.5 billion. Other firms announcing commitments include Salesforce, Scale AI, BlackRock, Oracle, Amazon Web Services and AI Pathfinder, with investments ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion pounds.

BlackRock Inc.’s India venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group expects the nearly $900 billion local mutual fund industry to expand up to threefold over the next seven years, fueled by record inflows from domestic investors and a robust economy. Participation in Indian financial markets is starting to increase rapidly, much of that driven by digital platforms, according to Sid Swaminathan, chief executive officer of Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal alliance between Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. and the world’s largest asset manager. Asia’s richest man is seeking to reshape India’s financial services industry by leveraging his vast telecom and retail empire. For BlackRock, the tie-up marks a return to money management in the world’s fastest-growing major economy after its exit in 2018. The move coincides with a shift in household savings — once tied-up in gold and property — toward financial markets. The change has fueled an explosive growth in the domestic mutual fund sector, with assets more than doubling over the past five years. “Being in India at this point in its economic journey, there are so many tailwinds in our favor,” Swaminathan, who joined the venture after a 20-year stint with BlackRock in London, told Bloomberg News in an interview. India’s equity markets have more than doubled to $5.3 trillion over the last five years, drawing millions of retail investors. But Jio BlackRock faces stiff competition from entrenched fund houses backed by major lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India, which command big distribution networks that reach small towns and villages. Online investment platforms such as Groww and Zerodha are also fueling the boom in direct mutual fund sales. Investor appetite, however, has been strong. The Jio BlackRock venture raised more than $2 billion in just three days for its debut funds in July, placing the alliance among the top 15 managers in that category. “For us to be operating in the next five years as a player of scale, it has to be about growing the market, rather than just capture market share from existing players,” Swaminathan said. That aim is shaping the asset manager’s approach: It is preparing a mix of passive and active strategies, with its first active equity fund set to launch next week. The product will draw on nearly 400 indicators on about 1,000 Indian stocks, building a portfolio broader than is typical for the category. In addition, it plans to launch a fund that rotates between sectors based on quantitative signals and is considering another one that systematically allocates between asset classes, Swaminathan said. The partnership hired Rishi Kohli, who headed hedge fund quantitative strategies at InCred Capital and Avendus, as its chief investment officer. The room for growth in systematic strategies is large in India, given the low starting point, Swaminathan said, describing the data-driven approach that also incorporates human judgment. As the market matures with more stocks and greater industry diversity, it becomes more conducive to such strategies, he said. The venture plans to use alternative data, from web-search activity to retail sentiment on online forums, and evaluate auditor quality when ranking firms. The Jio BlackRock partnership, spanning asset management, wealth management and equity broking, is pursuing a direct-to-consumer strategy via its app, bypassing traditional brokers and distributors. A sharp market decline could slow the sector’s expansion. Indian equities have significantly underperformed emerging-market peers in the past year, partly due to weak earnings growth and stretched valuations. Yet retail flows remain resilient, with monthly systematic investment plans topping $3 billion in August even as foreign funds retreated.

The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries. By Caolán Magee and PA Share Save United States President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, describing it as a “great honour” to be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The US president landed at the London Stansted airport on Tuesday evening, where new UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper was among those greeting him as he stepped off Air Force One. Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, is expected to stay overnight at Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park, before travelling to Windsor Castle on Wednesday for a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet. Thousands are expected to protest during his stay, though he has no public-facing engagements planned. Speaking to reporters before landing, Trump said: “My relationship is very good with the UK, and Charles, as you know, who’s now King, is my friend. It’s the first time this has ever happened where somebody was honoured twice. So, it’s a great honour.” The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries’ multi-trillion-dollar tech sectors. Trump is expected to be joined by a delegation of US executives, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Sky News reported that BlackRock plans to invest $700m in British data centres as part of a series of announcements tied to the state visit. The UK was the first country to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the Trump administration in May. Under that deal, Washington pledged to reduce tariffs on aluminium and steel from 25 percent to zero, though the changes have yet to take effect. Trump has hinted at possible tariff relief for UK steel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country residence, on Thursday. “I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit. We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them,” Trump said. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Funding another buyback push, SharpLink's Ethereum balance sheet swells to $3.86 billion, enticing long-term growth strategies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Shares of SharpLink Gaming fell slightly even as the Ethereum treasury firm pressed forward with its ambitious stock repurchase program, buying another 1 million shares. The company, which trades under the ticker SBET, said the latest purchases were executed at an average price of $16.67 each. Despite the move, SharpLink’s stock slipped 2.8% to $16.32 by late afternoon in New York. The buybacks are part of a $1.5 billion authorization approved in August. To date, the firm has retired nearly 1.93 million shares for about $32 million, funding the purchases with cash reserves, staking income, and other financing rather than debt. Alongside the buybacks, SharpLink continued to build its Ethereum balance sheet. The firm reported holding 838,152 ETH as of Sept. 16, up from 740,760 tokens a month earlier, with a total value of about $3.86 billion. The figure includes 3,240 ETH earned through staking since June. The company, backed by Ethereum developer Consensys, is the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion, which controls more than 2 million tokens. Together, the two firms account for the majority of Ethereum kept on the books by the roughly 70 public digital asset treasury companies that own at least 100 ETH each. SharpLink said it will only repurchase shares when its net asset value (NAV) falls below 1 — a level it considers a signal that the stock is undervalued compared with its crypto holdings. As of Sept. 15, SBET’s NAV stood at 0.91x, meaning the market was valuing its shares at about 9% below its ether reserves. Buybacks have become increasingly common among digital asset treasuries, though they remain controversial. Critics say they risk prioritizing short-term price support, while SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, argues the program is “immediately accretive” and strengthens long-term shareholder returns. SharpLink shares surged earlier this year after announcing a partnership with Consensys, briefly topping $78 in June, but have since pulled back. The company said it remains committed to aligning shareholder value with Ethereum’s growth, underscoring its strategy of using token accumulation and selective buybacks to “buy low and sell high.” AJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Title: Trump Postpones TikTok Ban Enforcement for Fourth Time as He Claims ‘We Have a Deal’ With China to Sell App’s U.S. Operations to ‘Very Big Companies’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tikotok-ban-trump-postpones-enforcement-deal-app-1236520948/

Consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz would own 80% of TikTok U.S., WSJ reports By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok U.S. is poised to get a new ownership structure — and a new app for American users — if the Trump administration’s much-delayed efforts to ink a deal to comply with a federal law banning Chinese control of the app go through. President Donald Trump, speaking with reporters Tuesday outside the White House, said, “We’ve got a deal on TikTok. I’ve reached a deal with China.” He said there are “very big companies that want to buy it.” Trump said he is going to speak with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday “to confirm everything.” Related Stories 'Mamma Mia' Returns to Broadway: Here's How to Buy Tickets to the Revival Online 'Let the Good Times Roll,' Musical About New Orleans History and Culture, Eyes Broadway Bow (EXCLUSIVE) Since the deal isn’t final yet, Trump is again postponing his administration’s enforcement of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill — the fourth time he’s done so — pushing the deadline out 90 days, from Sept. 17 to Dec. 16. Popular on Variety Trump did not provide details on TikTok U.S.’s potential new owners. According to a Wall Street Journal report, TikTok’s U.S. business would be 80% owned and controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. In addition, current ByteDance investors including Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic, would be part of the 80% ownership group. Chinese shareholders including ByteDance would own the remainder, according to the Journal report, which cited anonymous sources. The new TikTok U.S. company would have a U.S.-dominated board that includes a member designated by the U.S. government, per the WSJ report. U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade talks Monday in Madrid, where China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters the two sides had reached a “basic framework consensus” for a deal to keep TikTok available in the U.S., according to a Reuters report. Reps for TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment. Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. The Trump administration has been trying to reach a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law while also being an arrangement that will be acceptable to the Chinese government. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. The transfer of ownership would result in TikTok’s current U.S. users having to download and install a new app, which will be wholly separate from the app as it exists in the rest of the world, per the Journal. The U.S. version of the app will have a content-recommendation algorithm that uses technology licensed from ByteDance, while Oracle will continue to manage and host TikTok’s U.S. data. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s co-chief for the Middle East and North Africa and one of its top asset-management executives is set to leave the bank. Fadi Abuali is departing the New York-based firm after almost 28 years with the company, according to an internal memo. A Goldman spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. Abuali was instrumental in expanding Goldman’s franchise in the Middle Eastern and North Africa since he was appointed co-CEO for the region alongside Zaid Khaldi almost five years ago. The bank opened an office in Abu Dhabi in 2023 and last year became the first Wall Street lender to secure a so-called regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to anchor Goldman’s new private-credit and public-equity strategies in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf. As part of the bank’s push into Middle Eastern private credit, it is relocating London-based executive Deb Dutt to the region, Abuali said in a recent interview. Goldman asset managers in the Middle East have been in high demand, with Khalid Albdah, head of Goldman in Saudi Arabia and co-head of the regional asset-management arm, leaving late last year for Neuberger Berman. Earlier in 2024, BlackRock Inc. tapped Mohammad Al Fahim, who oversaw Goldman’s Abu Dhabi branch, to head its operations in the United Arab Emirates. Aside from the Middle East and North Africa, Abuali also jointly ran Goldman Asset Management’s international arm, serving as a key lieutenant to Marc Nachmann, global head of the bank’s asset- and wealth-management business, and was global co-head of the asset-management institutional-client business.

Photo by Ben McShane/Sportsfile Former CEO Peter Halpin says it is “quite shocking” to think back at how close Dundalk FC came to going out of existence 12 months ago. The Blackrock man, who vacated his role at Oriel Park in February to concentrate on his own business, Halpin Sport Sponsorship, was at the heart of frantic phone calls this time last year to keep the doors open after Brian Ainscough threatened to liquidate the debt-ridden club.

Title: Mitsotakis: Reliable and costed fiscal policy is a fundamental principle

The impressive growth dynamics of the Greek economy were mentioned, among others, by the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who participated today in a discussion with BlackRock Vice President Philip Hildebrand and Adebayo Ogunlezi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, at the Athens International Investors Summit investment conference, organised by Yperat Fund and BlackRock. He stressed that the fundamental principle is a reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy so that fiscal and macroeconomic stability is not questioned, that the benefits from the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens, while he also highlighted the importance of defense, which he called the supreme European public good. The Prime Minister also had the opportunity to address, before powerful investment players with broad portfolios, the country’s prospects, investment opportunities, and challenges in several sectors, and the issues of green transition and energy. During the forum, the establishment of the Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund, which is the investment arm of the Super Fund, was announced. “We are growing at a much higher rate than the eurozone average, while at the same time reducing taxes, focusing on private investment, promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment,” the prime minister said during his remarks. “We have achieved all this in an environment of political stability. We have a government with an absolute majority. In 2023, the citizens rewarded us by giving us a new mandate. I think this sets us apart from many other European countries, because coalition politics can be very complicated,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis continued. “I think the big challenge, from a political point of view, is to link the macroeconomic situation to everyday life and work, in an environment where the cost of living has become a big problem,” the prime minister stressed. “I think there is a general understanding that this page turn is here to stay. My job is to ensure that the changes we have implemented are irreversible. That’s my commitment to the investment community and, frankly, the main reason why I want to seek a third term. To ensure that what we have achieved continues and that the wealth we are creating for the country is maintained. My first commitment in 2023 was to raise wages. When I see unemployment falling from 18% to 8%, that means that real wages are rising, Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted. “This is the only way to truly distribute wealth,” he added. Referring to the importance of reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy, the prime minister noted: “The fundamental principle of our approach has always been not to question the pursuit of fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The 2009-2010 crisis was a consequence of the spending derailment and our failure to focus on fundamentally restructuring our economy. We will not repeat the same mistake, ever. That is why our commitment to generate primary surpluses and, whenever possible, fiscal surpluses, will not be challenged.” The Prime Minister also stressed that the benefits of the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens through systematic tax cuts, with an emphasis on middle incomes, young people and families with children. “The biggest reform that has contributed to the state budget has been our ability to address the problem of tax evasion. This brought a lot of money into the public coffers, which we now have to return to the citizens. So we reduced taxes for the middle class. We have reduced taxes for families with children. We have reduced income tax to zero for those under 25 years of age. I want to encourage young people to join the workforce; I don’t want them to wait years. I respect young kids who go to technical school and enter the workforce at age 20. I want them to know that we are thinking about them,” he said. During the debate on the future of European defence, given the current geopolitical landscape, the prime minister said: “We will need to mobilise not only private but also public funds. We will need to mobilise European public resources for defence. I have been clear on this issue; I have spoken about it on many occasions. The recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace has brought to the fore something that we already know is a major problem, and that concerns missile defence and air defence systems in Europe. Therefore, my proposal is very clear: a pan-European tool for what I consider to be a pan-European good. And defence is the ultimate European public good. We cannot allow our national priorities to become an obstacle to tackling what is essentially an existential threat to Europe. Can this happen? The answer is that I see much greater potential. Some of the traditionally ‘frugal’ countries, such as Denmark and Finland, are much more open to the idea of joint European defence borrowing.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis also addressed, among other things, the issue of green transition and energy. “Greece has been extremely successful in adding renewable energy sources, both solar and wind, to our energy mix. We produce more than 50% of our electricity from renewable sources. Especially in spring or autumn, we have the possibility of having all our electricity generated for hours from renewable sources. For the first time this summer, we have also seen greater price convergence between Western, Central, and South-Eastern Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “We need more interconnections. We have become net exporters of electricity. This has never happened before. But, of course, we will need additional investments in baseload – in the case of Greece, we are talking about natural gas – and of course, investments in storage. This is the plan as to how we intend to proceed with the green transition in a realistic way, but also taking into account that for us, renewable energy sources constitute an important comparative advantage,” he added.
