We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated: “This is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks Cramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby. “If we need more energy, we’re going to get it from what comes out of the ground … fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas… You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.” Cramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion. Cramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying: “... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.” Turning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting. “Now that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that “drill baby drill” thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A drilling rig in the desert with an orange sunset in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Cramer called Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) one of the “largest pure-play drillers” while mentioning that the stock has had a bad year and was down 20%. He further said: “With Wall Street expecting nearly 9% earnings growth, Halliburton is even more of a bargain trading at eight times next year's earnings estimates even though it's also expected to put up 9% growth in 2025. However, those valuations are only attractive if SLB and Halliburton can make the numbers. Otherwise, their stocks’ going to stay in the doghouse.” Cramer went on to say: “Now, the other major oil service company, Halliburton reports in two weeks, November 7. This stock has lagged SLB this year because Hal's more levered to the North American market rather than the international markets that are doing better. We'll see what Hal has to say in a fortnight, but if the outlook that SLB just gave us is correct, low growth for international, no growth or declines from North America then Hal should be in worse shape than SLB. Even though Halliburton remains an excellent operator, it's just the wrong business mix for the current environment.” Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a major provider of products and services in the global energy sector, specializing in production enhancement, cementing solutions, and comprehensive drilling support. For the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $5.8 billion, with an operating margin of 18%. During the earnings call, CEO Jeffrey Allen Miller expressed optimism about steady growth for the company throughout the remainder of 2024. Management highlighted strong demand for the company's services in international markets, noting high activity levels and equipment shortages across all major basins. The environment supports expectations of approximately 10% revenue growth for the international business for the full year. However, the outlook for North America presents a different picture, as management anticipates a decline in revenues between 6% and 8% compared to the previous year due to reduced activity levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, Halliburton’s (NYSE:HAL) Completion and Production division is expected to experience a sequential revenue decrease of 1% to 3%, with margins projected to drop by 75 to 125 basis points. In contrast, the Drilling and Evaluation division is forecasted to see a sequential revenue increase of 2% to 4%, accompanied by a rise in margins ranging from 25 to 75 basis points. Overall HAL ranks 11th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of HAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country's second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Swiggy, Blackrock and CPPIB did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. Indian shares have fallen for four weeks in a row, the longest such losing run since August 2023, with the benchmark Nifty 50 index down more than 8 per cent from record highs hit on Sept. 27, due to persistent foreign selling. Hyundai India shares fell 7.2 per cent on their debut last week after retail investors gave a lukewarm reception amid concerns about a lofty valuation. Swiggy, backed by SoftBank and Prosus, was concerned to avoid a tepid response to its relatively large IPO, coming amid global uncertainty from the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, and decided to cut the valuation in consultation with investors, said one source, with direct knowledge of the company's plans. Swiggy does not want a "bad IPO", this person said. Its last funding round, led by Invesco, valued it at $10.7 billion in 2022. It competes with Zomato in India's online restaurant and cafe food deliveries sector, and both have made major bets on a boom in "quick-commerce," where groceries and other products are delivered in 10 minutes. Despite recent jitters, India's IPO market has been buoyant, with around 270 companies raising $12.57 billion so far this year, well above the $7.4 billion raised in all of 2023.

(NYSE:ZIM), Cramer remarked that he has faced monetary losses because of the shipping stock. “A lot of people feel that it's Zim's time. I'm much more on the fence because historically, I've lost a lot more money than I made in the shipping stock so I say stay away.” ZIM (NYSE:ZIM) offers container shipping and related services both in Israel and on a global scale. On October 23, Barclays analyst Marco Limite raised the price target on the stock to $13.90 from $12.30 and kept an Underweight rating. This change showed updates to third-quarter and 2024 forecasts, indicating that the guidance increase has been largely priced in. The firm noted a continued negative outlook for the sector overall. As of June 30, 2024, ZIM’s (NYSE:ZIM) total cash position, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and investments in various financial instruments, fell by $351 million, decreasing from $2.69 billion at the end of December 2023 to $2.34 billion. The company reported capital expenditures of $66 million for the second quarter of 2024, a rise from the $26 million spent during the same period in 2023. Additionally, its net debt position grew to $3.25 billion by the end of June 2024, up from $2.31 billion at the close of the previous year, showing an increase of $936 million. However, the company has raised its full-year guidance for 2024, projecting Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.6 billion to $3.0 billion, and Adjusted EBIT between $1.45 billion and $1.85 billion.

By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian food delivery giant Swiggy has slashed its IPO valuation again, to $11.3 billion, 25% below the initial goal of $15 billion as market volatility and the lacklustre debut of Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) India weigh on sentiment, two sources said on Sunday.

Title: Michael Saylor Urges Microsoft To Consider Bitcoin As Path To Next Trillion-Dollar Growth

Time Published: 2024-10-27T05:30:27Z

Following Microsoft’s recent proposal to shareholders to consider investing in Bitcoin, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy and a prominent BTC advocate, publicly encouraged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to embrace the largest cryptocurrency as a means to future growth. In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Saylor stated, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for the Microsoft shareholders, call me,” emphasizing the financial potential of BTC investments. Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, has made headlines for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy over the past four years, significantly boosting its stock price. On Friday, MicroStrategy’s shares hit a 25-year high of $245, reflecting a substantial stock rally driven specifically by BTC holdings strategy approach. Even Microsoft’s report on its assessment of investing in BTC pointed out that MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed the company’s by an impressive 313% this year despite only doing a fraction of the business. In its report, Microsoft noted the success of MicroStrategy’s investment approach, highlighting that its stock has seen substantial gains thanks to its BTC holdings. Interestingly, some analysts speculate that Microsoft’s new focus on BTC investment might be influenced by its second-largest shareholder company, BlackRock, which has recently entered the crypto market with the approval of their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds in January and July of this year respectively. Saylor has ambitious plans for MicroStrategy, including establishing the company as a leading Bitcoin or “merchant bank” capable of creating various BTC capital market instruments, such as stocks, convertibles and fixed income products. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Saylor envisions a future where MicroStrategy holds $100 billion to $150 billion in Bitcoin through these financial structures. MicroStrategy owns over 252,000 BTC, valued at approximately $15.7 billion, acquired largely through debt financing. Saylor stated at the time: This is the most valuable asset in the world. The ultimate goal is to be the leading Bitcoin bank, or merchant bank, or you can call it a BTC financial company. Saylor’s strategy remains steadfast: “We just keep buying more Bitcoin,” he asserts. He believes that BTC’s value will soar, predicting that it could reach $13 million per coin by 2045 as it captures a larger share of global financial capital. This perspective contrasts sharply with other companies like Tesla, which have utilized Bitcoin gains for operational funding or fee extraction. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,800, recording a price recovery of 8% in the last two weeks and over 95% year-to-date.

Title: Is BlackRock Propping Up Bitcoin Price? Market Analyst Shares Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-blackrock-propping-up-bitcoin-price-market-analyst-shares-details/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T02:30:10Z

Bitcoin has faced a turbulent week, with price swings ranging from a local high of $69,500 to a low of $65,000, cooling off after weeks of bullish excitement. Now, BTC is consolidating just below the crucial $70,000 level, a price point seen as a key threshold for the next major move. Despite the price cooling, top investors and analysts are keeping a close watch on market dynamics. CryptoQuant analyst and prominent investor Maartunn recently shared a chart highlighting a significant increase in BlackRock’s balance and balance changes in BTC, suggesting that the financial giant may be strategically propping up the market. This insight into BlackRock’s growing involvement has sparked new optimism among investors, who view institutional support as a powerful foundation for Bitcoin’s potential rally. The company’s increased presence in the BTC market, as shown by Maartunn’s analysis, implies a deepening commitment that could bring greater stability and strength to BTC prices in the coming weeks. As Bitcoin stabilizes below $70,000, these signals from large players like BlackRock add an extra layer of anticipation to the market, with analysts speculating that their influence could propel BTC through critical resistance levels. Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment, with market sentiment strongly favoring a push to new all-time highs in the near future. Analysts and investors are growing increasingly optimistic as ETF flows have shown consistent positivity over the past few weeks, bolstering expectations for BTC’s upward trajectory. Price action, too, has been resilient, consolidating near critical resistance levels and signaling underlying strength in the market. A recent analysis by top analyst Maartunn sheds light on an intriguing dynamic involving BlackRock’s BTC holdings. Maartunn shared a chart revealing BlackRock’s Bitcoin balance and its net balance changes, indicating that the financial giant may be subtly propping up the market. The chart highlights a notable trend: positive balance changes at BlackRock have overwhelmingly outweighed negative ones, suggesting a sustained accumulation phase. This pattern implies that BlackRock may be positioning itself as a key BTC market maker, possibly providing liquidity and contributing to price stability in a highly volatile market. Such actions by BlackRock could prove to be a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s price, as institutional involvement historically encourages investor confidence and mitigates market downturns. With positive ETF flows and strategic accumulation from major players like BlackRock, the current setup points toward an environment primed for bullish movement. If BTC continues to hold these levels and institutional backing remains strong, the stage could be set for a rally that takes BTC to uncharted territory. Bitcoin is currently trading at $67,000 and appears to be forming a bullish flag pattern, which could potentially propel the price higher in the near term. The price has successfully held above the critical $65,000 level, providing a solid foundation for a bullish outlook as it indicates strong buyer interest. This key threshold has acted as support, preventing further declines and reinforcing the optimism among traders. However, the next week will be crucial for Bitcoin. If the price fails to break above the $70,000 mark, a retracement to lower demand levels is likely. Such a move could test the 200-day moving average, currently situated at $63,275. Should BTC drop below the $65,000 mark, this area would become a focal point for traders seeking strong demand, as it has historically served as a significant support level. Maintaining the bullish flag pattern and overcoming resistance at $70,000 will be vital for sustaining upward momentum. Traders will closely monitor price action to determine whether BTC can continue its ascent or if a pullback to lower levels is on the horizon. The coming days will reveal whether bullish sentiment can push BTC to new heights. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: McCanns to push Balmoral stake near to 80% in take-private plan

The McCann family, once synonymous with Fyffes, are pursuing a plan to take Balmoral International Land fully private, in a deal that will see the total stake of vehicles controlled by them close to 80 per cent. Balmoral, which has traded on a grey market operated by stockbroking firms since it was delisted from the Dublin stock exchange in 2011, issued a circular to shareholders last week saying it planned a mandatory buyback of stock held by investors holding fewer than 25,000 shares. They account for a combined 22.4 per cent stake in the company. The deal is being priced at €10.50 a share, representing a 110 per cent premium to where it last changed hands on the grey market in November, before stockbrokers stopped facilitating trades due to the burden of paperwork. There is also no realistic prospect of it rejoining the stock market “within any foreseeable time frame”, the company added. However, the price is only 56 per cent of Balmoral’s €18.72 reported net asset value per share as of the end of June. The buyback will cost €18 million in total – equating to the company’s current net cash position. It will increase direct McCann family stakes and indirect holdings, through vehicles they control, to a combined 79 per cent from just over 61 per cent currently. Balmoral said it had an “unusually large number of shareholders” for a small company, with nearly 5,000 investors – or 95 per cent of the total – holding fewer than 500 shares. Many of the stakes are small and had already been uneconomical to trade for some time. “The company continues to receive enquiries from shareholders who are keen to understand how they can unlock the value in their shares now that there is no active market in the company’s shares,” Balmoral chairman Carl McCann said in the document. “Having returned cash of €2.6 million to shareholders in 2023 and following further property sales this year the group is now in a net cash position, and on 30 September 2024 had gross cash of €47.5 million which is offset by debt of €29.5 million, giving net cash of €18 million.” An extraordinary general meeting to approve the matter will be held on November 21st in the Dublin offices of the company’s solicitors, Arthur Cox. However, this will be a mere formality, as 80.4 per cent of shareholders have already given “irrevocable undertakings” to vote in favour of the transaction, Balmoral said. The company was originally named Blackrock International Land when it was spun out by Fyffes in 2006 as a separate publicly-quoted. It was delisted in 2011 following a slump in its share price during the property crash, but continues to have thousands of legacy shareholders that have remained on board since the stock market exit. The McCann family sold their decades-old shares in Fyffes in 2017 to Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. The Tokyo-based firm subsequently sold the 30 per cent interest in Balmoral it inherited to a vehicle led by the McCanns. Mr McCann is also executive chairman of Dole Plc, the Irish-based but New York-listed fresh produce company created in 2021 through the merger of Dole Foods with former Total Produce. Dole and Fyffes are among Balmoral’s main tenants. The fair value of Balmoral’s investment assets, comprised of industrial and warehouse buildings, offices and mixed-use land, edged up to €146.3 million in June from €138 million in December, the company disclosed in the circular.

Title: 3 Big Differences – Nvidia Is Poised To Take Over From Apple
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/10/26/3-big-differences--nvidia-is-poised-to-take-over-from-apple/

Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure ... [+] illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) This week, Nvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple’s value at $3.52 trillion. AP reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia’s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies. “The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,” write AP reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. “Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.” Microsoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value. Nvidia’s Past Stock Activity A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. The Difference Between Nvidia and Apple What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. The Threat of ASICs While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Ethereum Continues Losing Ground To Bitcoin With ETH/BTC Ratio at Multi-Year Lows

Time Published: 2024-10-26T20:30:54Z

Ethereum (ETH) continues to perform poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) as the second-largest digital asset by reported market cap hit new multi-year lows against the top cryptocurrency. Today, Ethereum’s native ETH token slid further against BTC, recording a low of 0.0365 and erasing all its gains against Bitcoin since April 2021. This multi-year low against BTC is bound to dampen the expectations of ETH permabulls. In December 2021, ETH reached a local high of 0.0865 against BTC. However, since then, the smart contract token has been on a continual downward trajectory, declining by almost 58% against the premier digital asset. Notably, the last monthly green candle that ETH posted against BTC was in May 2024. It is highly likely that by the end of October, ETH will have posted five consecutive monthly red candles against Bitcoin. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, ETH is down by over 30% against BTC. Interestingly, within the last three months, the ETH/BTC trading pair has declined by over 22%, indicating that major losses against BTC are more recent. While various factors could be blamed for ETH’s lackluster price performance, a major reason is the rapidly increasing competition from rival smart contract blockchains such as Solana (SOL). The chart below shows that SOL has been on an upward trajectory against ETH after a brief consolidation in June 2024. On a YTD basis, SOL has recorded almost 60% gains against ETH. At the time of writing, the SOL/ETH ratio is trading close to a new all-time high (ATH) at 0.069. Although Ethereum adoption continues to grow – boosted by the recent Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – the effects are not entirely reflected in the price action of the native ETH token. A recent report found that more than 34 million ETH – close to 30% of its supply – is currently staked. Despite the lower circulating supply as a result of staking, ETH’s price continues to perform poorly against other digital assets. In addition, the extraordinary growth witnessed by Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, has taken the attention away from the smart contract platform. In August, Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital said “Ethereum is dying while L2’s dance on its grave.” Despite the growing pessimism toward its price action, ETH whales remain unfazed as they continue to scoop more tokens to benefit from potential future price appreciation. Recent analysis found that Ethereum whales now control about 43% of ETH’s entire supply. Similarly, earlier this month, asset manager BlackRock was found to be selling its BTC holdings for ETH, suggesting the firm’s bullish outlook on the token. At press time, ETH trades at $2,532, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Can't Stop Buying Bitcoin, $292 Million in One Sweep

U.Today - Top investment asset management firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has stayed on top of its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition game. On Friday, it relegated the other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to the background by scooping up $292 million worth of the flagship digital currency. On Oct. 24, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF stood out, receiving the bulk of inflows, with $165.54 million. This suggests growing investors’ confidence and interest in the firm's crypto ETF products. Compared to Grayscale, which pegged its sponsor fee at 1.5%, BlackRock asks for only 0.25%. This lower fee structure could serve as the advantage that makes IBIT more attractive to institutional and retail investors, especially those who wish to balance cost efficiency and exposure. Additionally, it reflects institutional investors' commitment to getting a slice of the highly speculative crypto market through ETFs. On Friday, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB registered $33.4 million in inflows, while Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie and WisdomTree’s products recorded $0 inflows. Generally, the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem is expanding at a fast rate. There is an expectation that Bitcoin ETFs will surpass 1 million BTC in holdings to outshine Satoshi Nakamoto. The total ETF holdings represent 97% of the one million BTC target, and BlackRock is leading the issuers. This article was originally published on U.Today

Data from Bloomberg shows that of the 575 ETFs launched this year, 14 of the top 30 products have been either new Bitcoin or Ethereum funds, with the top four spots owned by Bitcoin funds. And in the past four years, of the 1,800 ETFs that started trading during that span, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is the biggest by far in terms of inflows, the data shows. 575 ETFs have now launched in 2024... *14 of top 30* by inflows are either spot btc or eth ETFs. Includes 6 of top 10. There are also 2 MSTR-related ETFs in top 30. Crypto appetite from tradfi is real. pic.twitter.com/DmD6f5zJ1P — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 23, 2024 ETFs are popular investment vehicles that trade on stock exchanges. They allow investors to buy and sell shares that track the price of anything from the S&P 500 and gold to Bitcoin and real estate firms. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Bitcoin products, allowing 10 such funds to start trading on American stock exchanges after a decade of denials. The investment vehicles have been widely popular, attracting billions of dollars in months in flows. Last week, they collectively crossed the $20 billion mark—smashing expectations by taking just 10 months to do what gold ETFs did over five years. The reason for the fast money, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart, is partly down to investors who had wanted to invest in Bitcoin for some time, but didn't have a safe or easy way before the approval of the ETFs. Now that the ETFs are trading, that demand is rapidly entering the market. “I think it was partly pent-up demand,” he told Decrypt. “But it’s also new demand as people are learning more.” He added that traditional financial institutions are interested in the products too—including hedge funds involved in futures trading. “That has helped improve flows and demand,” he said, adding that hedge funds have been going long on the ETFs and then selling the futures contracts. Massive institutions—including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs—now have exposure to Bitcoin via the new products. The price of Bitcoin even hit a new all-time high in March following their approvals. But the Ethereum counterparts haven’t had as much luck thus far. The SEC approved the ETFs for the second-biggest cryptocurrency—reluctantly, it appeared—in May. They haven’t done nearly as much in terms of inflows since trading began in July. This is partially because Grayscale’s Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) previously operated like a closed-end fund rather than an ETF before July. Its subsequent conversion means that investors who previously had cash locked up in the fund have fast been redeeming shares—leading to massive outflows. So far, $3 billion has left the fund, bringing the total flows for all nine Ethereum ETFs currently trading to negative $472.7 million, Farside data shows. However, that doesn’t mean demand won't pick up. Investors have thrown cash at the other products, and that could mean a turnaround is on the horizon. “It’s just that the outflows from ETHE are overwhelming the inflows to these other [Ethereum] ETFs,” added Seyffart. “For now.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Blizzard Kicks off WoW 20th and Warcraft 30th Anniversary Celebrations

Hey, you want to buy a $90 Brutosaur mount? The 20th anniversary celebrations are kicking off for World of Warcraft, which is also being joined to the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise as a whole, and Blizz wants you to be able to celebrate the milestone in any number of ways, including handing them nearly a C note for a digital mount… because greed deserves representation too, doesn’t it? I mean, we’re coming up on the 15th anniversary of the Celestial Steed as well, the very first cash shop mount, the original greed steed… if we leave out that Runes of Magic mount from 2009. Blizz never met an idea they wouldn’t snatch and call their own! If Runes of Magic failed, it was probably in pricing too low. Why charge $10 when $25 is possible? Am I getting off course and editorializing too much already? That is the value add you come here for, isn’t it? Okay, let’s talk about the celebrations. WoW Turns 20 Blizz has the event broken out in their post nicely enough, so I am just going to use that. Two can play this stealing game Blizz! Here’s what you can look forward to during the WoW 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. All of which means you need to find the portal to the Caverns of Time… there is such a thing up in the old tower in Stormwind… and head on out of the cavern where you’ll find a fair laid out, with that big sword stuck in Azeroth visible in the distance. Did that show up with Battle for Azeroth? I forget. The event with the silhouette of the sword in the distance I found it a bit disorienting… but I also play WoW Classic with the old UI and so the whole new UI layout and such is different enough to require me to relearn a lot or go away. I did a couple of the intro quests and then went away. So that is the kick off of the big event. Over in WoW Classic… we have nothing on the calendar. If you’re playing 14 year old WoW you don’t get to celebrate 20 years. I was also a bit disappointed that, during my brief visit to retail, I did not see the $90 Brutorsaur mount out and about anywhere. I thought surely there would be one in the middle of the square in the grand tradition of “that guy on the mount” in Azeroth. But maybe $90 was too dear. Or maybe I just don’t go to the places where people show off those sorts of things in retail anymore. Stormwind is pretty old school at this point. A pity. It is a handsome mount, and even comes with an auctioneer and a mailbox, so you can do your business on the go. This baby will hold so many auctions If you want a better deal… for specific definitions of “better” I suppose… for just $30 they’ll sell you eight special edition mounts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise. I guess it always comes back to commerce. Anyway, the event runs out into the new year. Lots of time to partake. The actual 20th anniversary of the game is a month out still and I suspect there will be an achievement for logging in closer to that date as well. We shall see. Well, as we know from economics class, things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. So someone out there must be that into WoW that an occasional Benjamin is reasonable. Or maybe, based on your observation, $90 is a bridge too far and we will soon see “special discounts” … LikeLike Might be that we need to know where to look, like in TWW zones or something. I read that if you convert the mount to Canadian dollars and include tax the mount is worth $150 (Canadian). That’s… Yikes. LikeLike The $90 mount people are probably standing on a mailbox in whatever location is the “new” level capped watering hole. I guess it’s for the best that Blizz got rid of the ability to /spit on people, because I’d imagine that people would be doing that a lot. As for the event, apparently it consists of a ton of FOMO-induced weekly events, so I guess getting that old “gotta do all the chores” feeling from Legion onward is what they were aiming for to bring that nostalgia. I have heard through some YouTube posts here and there that there were some really broken pieces to the Retail patch that dropped, so I guess THAT is part of the 20th anniversary experience too. But yes, the irony that there’s an “original” version of the game available in Classic Era as well as a Cataclysm Classic version of the game that neither actually have a celebration in place says a lot about what Blizz thinks of the entire Classic endeavor. Even just a short note saying “thanks” from Blizzard Entertainment –like back in the old days– would have been nice. LikeLike I saw an image online of a pack of these mounts standing on top of something to obscure it from other players… because that is always what happened. But I think it was out in the TWW zones, which I do not have access to and I wasn’t interested enough to go find them even if I did have access. LikeLike I’d have to say that compared to anniversary celebrations I’ve seen in quite a number of other games over the years, that does not look like a very impressive selection. But then, I don’t really play WoW so I don’t have the context to judge. LikeLike I can assure you there are plenty of Brutosaurs about in Dornogal (the War Within capital). While players always wail and gnash their teeth about this kind of thing, there are enough of them out there who’ll happily buy it instantly to make it worth it for Blizz. I may write my own post about the anniversary event at some point, but it’s early days. It has some fun activities, but based on how it was described I kind of expected more. And the limitations on earning the event currency definitely feel heavy-handed. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

ERIC KIM Benzinga has extensively covered recent Bitcoin trends, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s resilience and investor interest. As Bitcoin currently hovers around $68,000, analysts on Benzinga see strong underlying support and potential for further gains. They suggest that the upcoming U.S. election could be a pivotal factor, with predictions that a Trump victory might push Bitcoin to $80,000 by year-end due to expected crypto-friendly policies, while a Harris victory might lead to a short-term dip before resuming an uptrend . Additionally, Benzinga notes that October has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, often termed “Uptober,” with the coin gaining around 8.9% so far this month. High inflows into Bitcoin ETFs also signal robust institutional interest, with companies like BlackRock leading the way, driving positive market sentiment and solidifying support at key price levels .

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Demand At 6-Month High, BTC Capped Below $70,000

Bitcoin prices are steady above the $66,000 support when writing on October 25. While confidence is high, the coin is still trending below the psychological round at $70,000. It has yet to shake off sellers in early October. However, looking at emerging spot Bitcoin ETF trends, this is about to change. The latest analysis by Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant on October 25 shows that the demand for these crypto derivative products has risen over the last 30 days. The uptick has seen the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States rise to a six-month high, attracting over 64,900 BTC in net flows. Net flows, which consider total inflows and outflows over the test period, can be used to gauge institutional interest. Whenever it rises, coupled specifically with expanding inflows, it means more institutions are getting exposure to the digital gold. The more institutional interest increases, the more likely BTC will shoot higher. Soso Value data shows that issuers in the United States collectively manage over $66 billion. On October 24, investors bought over $188 million of BTC through their issuers. So far, BlackRock, through its IBIT, is the largest issuer, controlling over $27 billion of BTC. Over the past few months, Grayscale’s GBTC has seen massive outflows. On October 24, over $7 million of BTC were redeemed from GBTC. There are high hopes that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States paved the way for institutions to drive prices. Before then, most found exposure to BTC via approved Trusts, some offered by Grayscale. Meanwhile, some institutions bought MicroStrategy stocks as their performance reflected BTC, given the public company’s heavy investment in the digital asset. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy owns over 250,000 BTC, the biggest haul of any public company in the United States and worldwide. Over the years since their strategy of regularly stacking BTC, its stock, MSTR, has outperformed top stocks and indices in the United States. Only time will tell whether BTC bulls have what it takes to break above $70,000. The round number marks September highs. If Bitcoin builds on the rejection of lower prices on October 24, it could find the momentum necessary to define the short-term trajectory. A firm close above this psychological resistance line paves the way for a retest of $72,000 and all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Here are the make-or-break factors for bitcoin after a blistering rally so far in 2024

Time Published: 2024-10-26T12:26:01Z
Full Content:
It's been a momentous year for bitcoin, with big price gains to match some of the most important developments for the token in years. It started with the Securities and Exchange Commission's groundbreaking approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. That made it easier for average investors to buy and trade the crypto, and helped mainstream the token via fund offerings from asset management titans like BlackRock and Fidelity. In April, bitcoin underwent its scheduled "halving," reducing the amount of tokens miners are rewarded by half. The event, which happens roughly every four years, is bullish as it cuts the supply of new tokens to the market. The cryptocurrency has surged 57% in 2024, and is up by over 90% in the last year. Investors and analysts are still bullish, eyeing more gains in the year to come even as election uncertainty looms. "I'm really bullish for 2025," Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Business Insider. "There are all these positive trends." Still, other market pros told BI that there are some headwinds building that could cause the rally to stumble. Here are the make-or-break factors to watch. Hougan pointed to a broad set of monetary easing cycles from central banks as a key bullish driver for bitcoin. Central bank easing typically boosts risk assets like crypto. When interest rate volatility was high over the summer, Bitcoin slumped as investors poured into defensive areas of the market. The Federal Reserve's big rate cut last month fueled a bitcoin rally, and crypto experts say the broader central bank easing cycle that's kicking off around the world should reinforce the gains. CoinDesk Indices' Andy Baehr says that monetary easing should fuel the cryptocurrency's rise in the months ahead. "This is something the market can count on for months or quarters. The mood changed right away," Baehr said, pointing to the immediate rise in bitcoin's price as well as an increase in other indicators of strength like rising exchange volumes. Less bullish for crypto would be a more muscular regulatory approach to the market, and uncertainty about the oversight regime is a headwind. "The worst outcome for crypto is one that sustains uncertainty around the direction of crypto legislation and regulation," Hougan said, adding that the election outcomes could throw a wrench into the equation. "We have a hunch of what a Harris administration or a Trump administration would do, but we know that those promises don't always come through, and you can have harsh results," Hougan said, pointing to when crypto was excited for Gary Gensler to take over as SEC chair before proving strict on crypto regulation. Hougan said, though, that he thinks bitcoin appears to be in the clear with regulators after the SEC approved the spot ETFs. The US presidential election also remains top of mind for crypto investors. While both Trump and Harris are seen as pro-crypto, it's been Trump who has embraced the market publicly in recent months, speaking at events and even launching his own NFTs. This has led the market to believe he'd be the one to truly allow it to flourish and bitcoin has rallied as Trump's odds of winning the election have risen. A Trump win could shoot bitcoin to $125,000 by the end of the year, a jump of over 80% from Friday's prices, according to Standard Charter analyst Geoff Kendrick. But even if odds shift in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, bitcoin will likely still rally, Hougan said. He says a Trump win would be an accelerant for crypto in the few months after the election, but bitcoin will likely do well in the long term regardless, as Harris appears to be friendlier to crypto than President Joe Biden. "Two years ago, crypto was talking about Sam Bankman Fried and the biggest financial crime of all time, and crypto was completely toxic. Today, both presidential campaigns are posturing in positive ways toward the crypto industry," Hougan said. After the election, bitcoin's path looks less clear. As markets fixate on the result of the November contest, there's no clear catalyst for further gains after that. "Sharks need to swim to survive. If they stop they will die," Hougan said, adding, "Bitcoin is sort of like that. It is, in the end, a narrative- and growth-focused entity." He says, though, that the narrative could point toward greater institutional adoption, or toward more potentially real-world applications for crypto. Among the bullish drivers, the spot ETFs that drove a rally earlier this year will likely still have a positive impact. "I think Bitcoin ETF flows will accelerate in Q4 and then accelerate again in 2025. And I don't think that's priced into the market or expected," Hougan said. Baehr said the rising prominence of bitcoin ETFs and their backing from firms like BlackRock will help the crypto push further into the mainstream. "I think that the asset class now is able to participate in more serious conversations, and so the price of bitcoin is just going to enjoy that universal expansion and that network enrichment," Baehr said.

Title: Tokenized treasuries are red-hot, but face struggles to dethrone stablecoins

Investing.com -- Creating digital versions, or tokenizing real world assets on blockchains has been at the cutting edge of demonstrating crypto's use case. And now tokenised treasuries are enjoying their moment in the spotlight as an alternative yield to stablecoins, but these emerging digital assets face significant hurdles toward wider adoption needed to dethrone stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries -- the digital versions of Treasury bonds created on a blockchain such as Ethereum -- have racked up a market cap of nearly $2.5 billion, up from around $800M since the turn of the year, according to data from tracker RWA.xyz. "This universe of tokenized treasuries has been growing fast over the past year approaching $2.4bn. And, although much smaller than the $180bn universe of traditional stablecoins, their fast growth has the potential to challenge stablecoin's dominance in the future," analysts at JPMorgan said in a recent note. The need for yield-bearing alternatives to major stablecoins such as Tether and USDC/USD, which typically don't offer interest or share reserve yields, has been driving demand for tokenized treasuries. It makes good regulatory sense for stablecoins to avoid offering interest to its users as doing so would attract further regulatory restrictions, requiring compliance with securities law, JPMorgan said, "thus hindering their current seamless and permissionless use as source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem." Stablecoin users, however, aren't sitting idle willing to stomach the opportunity cost of holding yield-bearing assets. They have been employing various strategies to earn yield on their stablecoins. But these strategies such as secured lending, unsecured lending, basis trade "involve risk and ceding control and custody of their balances," the analysts said. With U.S. Treasury yields still at multi-year highs, and now expected to remain higher for longer as U.S. economic exceptionalism continues, tokenized government debt appears to be scratching the 'need for yield' itch and could potentially continue to pry away dollars from stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries offer several advantages over traditional stablecoins. They provide yield to users without the need for risky trading or lending strategies, not require users to cede control or custody of their assets. The market for tokenized treasuries has also been spurred by institutional investors launching tokenized funds, allowing investors access to on-chain offerings with 24/7 liquidity. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, earlier this year on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing investors to redeem their shares or BUIDL tokens for USDC stablecoin through a smart contract at any time, without the need for an intermediary. Some tokenized funds including Blackrock's BUIDL, which has amassed a market cap of nearly $0.6 million since its launch in April, are also looking to steal stablecoins' lunch in a key market: the crypto derivatives market. Stablecoins tend to be used as collateral in crypto derivatives trades, with Tether Holdings’s stablecoin USDT and Circle Internet Financial's USDC among the most widely used tokens for derivatives collateral on exchanges, with market caps of $120B and $34B, respectively. But this very advantage, the offering of yield, that tokenized treasuries are able to dangle in front of investors poses a major headwind in their quest to steal sizable portion stablecoins' lunch. "Tokenized treasuries fall under securities law which restrict offerings to accredited investors, thus inhibiting broader market adoption," the analysts said. BlackRock's BUIDL, for example, has high entry barriers with a minimum investment of $5 million and restriction on offering these products to accredited investors. Blackrock's big push to persuade cryptocurrency exchanges to more widely use its digital token shows there is potential to partly replace traditional stablecoins as collateral in crypto derivative trading, but the liquidity or the lack thereof (relative to that of stablecoins), suggest these new kids on the crypto derivatives market block aren't likely to dominate any time soon. This regulatory hurdle suggests that stablecoins -- boasting a market cap nearing $180B across multiple blockchains and centralized exchanges, ensuring traders receive low transaction costs even for large transactions -- aren't at risk of losing the significant advantage they hold over tokenized treasuries in terms of liquidity, JPMorgan said. This deep liquidity, which is key to seamless trading, implies that tokenized treasuries, with a market cap of around $2.4B, would "eventually replace only a fraction of the stablecoin universe," JPMorgan said. While the bar to knock stablecoins off their perch is likely to remain high, tokenized Treasuries are expected to continue to grow by potentially replacing "non-yield-bearing stablecoins in DAO treasuries, liquidity pools, and idle cash with crypto venture funds."

Title: Is Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) the Best Airline Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Airline Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) stands against the other airline stocks. We also dive deep into trends in the commercial aviation industry, especially the impact the return of international travel to pre-pandemic levels has had on the airline industry. The coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the global airline industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues slumped from $838 billion in 2019 to $384 billion a year later, registering a 54.1% downfall. However, the market has gradually recovered over the last few years and is on track for solid growth as international travel resumes worldwide. READ ALSO: 10 Best Airline Stocks To Buy According To Short Sellers and 10 Worst Airline Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. A report by UN Tourism in January this year stated that international tourism was recorded in 2023 at 88% of pre-pandemic levels, and is on track to return to levels before the coronavirus struck. The IATA anticipates global airline revenue to reach $996 billion in 2024, 19% higher than in 2019 and 1.5 times higher than the pandemic low of 2020. The global travel recovery has been led by the Middle East, the strongest tourism market in 2023, as it welcomed 22% more travelers than it did in 2019, becoming the only region to prevail over pandemic levels. Europe reached 94% of the levels in 2019, while Africa stood at 96%. Asia Pacific has been rather slow, recovering only 65% of pre-pandemic levels as of last year. The uptick in international travel is yielding solid returns this year. As of October 23, 2024, a major airline ETF issued by U.S. Global Investors has grown by 18.44% YTD, outperforming the broader market by 4.5%. Analysts at Forbes believe airline stocks are poised for strong growth during the second half of 2024 as fuel prices dip after long periods of price hikes. Fuel accounts for between 20-30% of airlines’ total costs. Moreover, airlines in the US are cutting down on excess domestic capacity after compressed margins during the summer season. The oversupply of seats has resulted in lower fares, and airline operators are determined to correct that. The deceleration of capacity, coupled with strong travel demand, will enhance their pricing power and improve earnings. Hedge fund sentiment on airline stocks is also encouraging. Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds shared his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26. He noted a significant growth in aircraft orders, resulting in major aircraft manufacturers having a 12-year backlog of orders. Bancroft cited China as the primary catalyst driving robust demand. According to the portfolio manager, the country represented 20% of all new aircraft orders as Chinese airlines strive to cater to the growing demand for travel among the middle class at home and in neighboring India. Bancroft also highlighted the rising middle class in the United States and other parts of the world that are increasing international travel, and contributing to the strength of the commercial aviation industry. We sampled stocks from ETFs with airline exposure and then picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft in flight, highlighting the efficiency of the company's fleet. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) is a publicly traded airline passenger and cargo service company. It owns two airlines: Copa Airlines, which provides international air transportation through its hub in Panama City, and Copa Airlines Colombia, which operates domestic and international flights from various cities in Colombia. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 24 hedge funds held stakes in the company, making it one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Renaissance Technologies is the biggest investor in the company, among those tracked by Insider Monkey, with its holding valued at $82.99 million as of June 30, 2024. The company reported robust results during the second quarter of 2024, earning a net profit of $120.3 million, with EPS logged at $2.88. Its operating margin stood at 19.5%, making it the second-best quarter in the airline’s history. The strong performance was driven by a 10.6% increase in passenger traffic from the same period last year. Capacity increased by 9.7% during the quarter, resulting in a 0.7% increase in load factor, which now stands at 86.8%. Another metric that paints a promising picture of the company is the 5.8% year-over-year decline in cost per average seat mile, driven by lower sales and distribution charges and reduced aircraft maintenance costs. Low sales and distribution costs were attributed to most passengers directly booking their flights from Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA), instead of third-party channels. Customers also increasingly utilize the low-cost NDC travel agency channel. Looking ahead, the airline is aiming to ramp up its capacity between September and December to reach full capacity by the end of the year. It has also reaffirmed its operating margin for the full year 2024 to be in the range of 21% to 23%. This has led to a bullish sentiment around the stock. Wall Street analysts have consensus on the stock’s Strong Buy rating and anticipate a near 49% upside potential, on average, in its share price. The company does face a challenge emanating from the suspension of flight operations to Venezuela which is likely to affect its capacity and unit revenue guidance. However, the overall outlook for the company remains positive. Overall CPA ranks 6th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CPA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CPA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

He noted a significant growth in aircraft orders, resulting in major aircraft manufacturers having a 12-year backlog of orders. Bancroft cited China as the primary catalyst driving robust demand. According to the portfolio manager, the country represented 20% of all new aircraft orders as Chinese airlines strive to cater to the growing demand for travel among the middle class at home and in neighboring India. Bancroft also highlighted the rising middle class in the United States and other parts of the world that are increasing international travel, and contributing to the strength of the commercial aviation industry. We sampled stocks from ETFs with airline exposure and then picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A commercial Boeing 737 aircraft flying in the sky with the well-known SWABIZ logo on it. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is a major airline based in the United States, that offers flights from 117 airports across 11 countries. The low-cost carrier operates on a point-to-point model enabling direct flights between destinations, and eliminating the time and distance taken when traveling with airlines that require passengers to travel through a conventional hub. During the second quarter of 2024, Southwest Airlines generated a revenue of $7.35 billion, beating expectations of $7.32 billion, and up 4.5% from last year. Net income for Q2 stood at $367 million, resulting in an EPS of 58 cents, which beat estimates, but was down 46% year-over-year. The company’s earnings continue to be burdened, partly driven by plane delivery delays from Boeing, which has depressed revenues and increased pressures on costs. The airline has also been greatly affected by dampened airfares amid overcapacity in the domestic market. According to a September report in the Associated Press, the company’s shares have lost around half of their value over the past three years due to these factors, which has led to increased investor pressure to improve performance. Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund, has launched a campaign to call a special meeting of shareholders to dump CEO Bob Jordan and replace two-thirds of the board of directors for underperformance. The airline has recently announced plans to end its open-seating policy and begin offering premium seating, in a bid to elevate customer experience and drive shareholder value. Southwest Airlines expects revenue from its new seat model and extra legspace to be north of what it generates from its ancillary offerings. The company will also be starting red-eye flights in early 2025. Southwest has also been improving its operational systems, which helped the company stay largely unaffected by the global tech outage in July. While hedge fund sentiment towards the company has dipped significantly – from 33 hedge funds having investments in the stock in Q1 to just 23 in Q2 – because of the ongoing headwinds, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) continues to be one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Overall LUV ranks 7th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of LUV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Will Microsoft Shareholders Vote ‘Yes’ On Bitcoin? What To Expect
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-shareholders-vote-bitcoin-what-to-expect/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T01:00:47Z

In a recent SEC filing dated Thursday, October 24, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) revealed that an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” will be a voting item at its forthcoming shareholder meeting on December 10. This development has ignited discussions within the investment community about the potential direction of Microsoft’s treasury strategy and the likelihood of shareholder approval. Microsoft’s board of directors has formally recommended voting against the Bitcoin investment proposal. In supplementary materials filed with the SEC on October 25, the board articulated that the requested assessment is redundant, emphasizing that Microsoft’s management already integrates considerations of cryptocurrencies into their broader investment strategy. The board highlights that “This proposal requests that the Board conduct an assessment that is unnecessary because Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team evaluates a wide range of investable assets to fund Microsoft’s ongoing operations, including assets expected to provide diversification and inflation protection.” The filing further noted that past evaluations have included Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making,” the filing adds. The board asserted confidence in Microsoft’s existing processes to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders, deeming the public assessment unnecessary. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted.” Microsoft’s shareholder base is a diverse mix of institutional investors, public companies, and individual investors. As of June 30, 2024, institutional investors held approximately 43.13% of Microsoft’s outstanding shares, while public companies and individual investors accounted for 56.84%. Insiders held a negligible 0.04% of the shares. The Vanguard Group stands as Microsoft’s largest shareholder, owning around 9.09% of the total shares outstanding. BlackRock follows with a 7.45% stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. State Street holds the third-largest position with a 4.04% ownership. Given this distribution, these major shareholders could be pivotal in determining the outcome of the proposal. Vanguard’s anti-BTC stance suggests a likely “no” vote, aligning with the board’s recommendation. Conversely, BlackRock has become a strong proponent of Bitcoin and offers its US clients a spot Bitcoin ETF since January this year. In their latest earning call, CEO Larry Fink said, “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” He added, “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” State Street seems somewhat open-minded to Bitcoin. In mid-September, State Street launched in collaboration Galaxy 3 new crypto ETFs. In August, State Street partnered with Taurus to enhance its crypto services, facilitating the transformation of real-world assets into tradable digital assets. Nonetheless, industry analysts largely predict that the proposal to invest in Bitcoin will not gain sufficient support among Microsoft shareholders. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, summarized the situation on X: “Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin. MSFT Board Advises ‘Nay’. No-Coiner Vanguard owns ~9%.” Similarly, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and Co-Founder of the ETF Institute, expressed his expectations: “Gonna go out on a limb & predict Microsoft’s largest shareholder (Vanguard) will be voting ‘no’ on adding btc to the balance sheet…” Di Lewis, CFO at BTC Inc., also expressed strong skepticism about Microsoft’s likelihood to adopt Bitcoin, stating there is “0% chance Microsoft adds bitcoin to their balance sheet this decade.” Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, dismissed the proposal as a “fringe” idea from a think tank shareholder. He stated, “No. This is a fringe proposal by a think tank shareholder, and is not a serious consideration by Microsoft at large.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,608.

Title: Bitcoin Could Bring Microsoft ‘Next Trillion Dollars’ in Value, Michael Saylor Suggests
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitcoin-could-bring-microsoft-next-trillion-dollars-in-value-michael-saylor-suggests/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T00:47:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has told Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella that he could help the company make “the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” In a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Saylor tagged Nadella and added along an image with a recent proposal for Microsoft shareholders to weigh in on adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. While the proposal, put forth by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has garnered attention, Microsoft’s board of directors has recommended voting against it. The company’s board argues that it has already evaluated many investment opportunities, including Bitcoin. The NCPPR’s rationale for the proposal centers on the success of Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy, which saw it outperform Microsoft by over 300% this year on the market even as it conducted a “fraction of the business” of the tech giant. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj The proposal points out that Microsoft has $484 billion in total assets “the plurality of which are US government securities and corporate bonds that barely outpace inflation,” and argues that corporations have a “fiduciary duty” to consider “diversifying their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” It points out that Bitcoin’s price has been rising significantly and that MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, managed to see its shares outperform those of Microsoft this year by more than 300%, despite “doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has.” The NCPPR’s proposal also points out that Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – offers its clients a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that can be used to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Per the independent think tank, BTC’s volatility means companies “should not hold too much of it,” but given its track record as a hedge against inflation companies should “also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether” and recommends a minimum allocation of 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin.

Title: Small Business Owners are branded “terrorists” by Federal Government

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/25/2024 3:20:20 PM PDT by george76 In just over 2 months every small business owner in America is required to be registered with the Federal Government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The Biden/Harris administration rolled out this unconstitutional law, known as the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), on January 1st, 2024. The CTA requires all small business owners in the United States, with revenue under 5 million and less than 20 full time employees to self-report to FinCEN, housed under the Department of Treasury. According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The CTA requires all small business owners in the United States, with revenue under 5 million and less than 20 full time employees to self-report to FinCEN, housed under the Department of Treasury. According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago. It’s insanity. 4 posted on 10/25/2024 3:33:21 PM PDT by Tucsonican [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: I want the USA back; george76 --- "Our government is even more fascist than I thought."

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula?

Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

All materials posted herein are protected by copyright law and the exemption for fair use of copyrighted works. Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing.

Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing.

Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will. Our government is even more fascist than I thought. The Leftist hatred of corporations allows Democrats to punish them however they want, but also redefine any business as a “corporation”. This gives them the leverage to enact Soviet-style persecution of kulaks. I’ve been making phone calls to clients all week about this and the process will continue at least through next week. This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago. It’s insanity. I file yearly, and so have a somewhat informed view. If one reads the "rules," screwing up on paperwork alone allows them to confiscate much. This is indeed corrupt fascism by stealth. I file yearly, and so have a somewhat informed view. If one reads the "rules," screwing up on paperwork alone allows them to confiscate much. This is indeed corrupt fascism by stealth. This will not survive a Trump second term. It is gross government overreach and is most probably unconstitutional. Treat it accordingly. The lawsuits have already begun. Doesn’t every small business owner have to report this info. to IRS anyway? It looks like this is just another law to trip up small businesses who can’t possibly keep up with all the laws and regs anymore, anyway. Probably unconstitutional??? Absolutely is. Do businessmen have the intestinal fortitude to stand against it? Tighten belts and SHUT DOWN in mass until they back off... Let the customers scream at them. No they don’t... There is that ONE PENNY they might lose... Big corporations play the fascist game, but small businesses cannot be controlled.

Title: Honeywell (HON) Leading Quantum Computing with Quantinuum

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 – $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries – chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility – due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You’ll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF’s performance wouldn’t be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we’ll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It’s hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there’s no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn’t look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM’s State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn’t experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can’t recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we’ve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts’ consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

A shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. High Upside Potential: 9.74% Number of Analysts: 9 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 5.5 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a conglomerate headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company operates in several industries like aerospace, energy, logistics, technology and healthcare, among others. The conglomerate operates in the quantum computing industry through its company Quantinuum, which was formed after the merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambrige Quantum. Among Quantinuum’s quantum partners are Airbus and BMW Group. In quantum, the company is known for ion-trapped qubits that it claims are easier to manufacture and control. The advantages offered by the approach are high fidelity and long coherence times. Compared to other technologies like superconducting qubits, trapped ions have shown better error rates. In January 2024, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) raised $300 million for Quantinuum, bringing the company’s valuation to $5 billion. This funding round, led by partners like JPMorgan Chase, has boosted investor confidence in Honeywell’s quantum initiatives. According to reports, Honeywell is considering an IPO for Quantinuum as early as 2025 and is reportedly looking for a valuation of $10 billion for its subsidiary. In its 2030 roadmap, the company said it would have a working universal quantum computer it calls Apollo by the end of the decade. A total of 9 analysts have rated the stock, and although the median upside is -3.31%, we ranked it on its upside from the high end, which stands at 9.74%. Overall, HON ranks 10th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM): ‘The Big Home Builder Reported What Looked Like A Jim-dandy Quarter’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. On Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech. Cramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted. “... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.” Cramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day’s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn’t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts. “See, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.” READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch He addressed the “alleged earnings disappointment,” clarifying that he chose the term “alleged” because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts. He reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment. Concluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked: “But the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Construction workers laying bricks during the residential development of multiple lots. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Cramer commented on PulteGroup, Inc.’s (NYSE:PHM) offering of incentives to reel in home buyers. Here’s what he had to say: “Then we go to Pulte Group. Yeah, the big home builder reported what looked like a Jim-dandy quarter, but when you look underneath, you see newfound “rot”, incentives, that was the point. Pulte has to now offer incentives for people to buy homes. The conference call bummed people out because CFO, Bob O'Shaughnessy said, and I'm gonna quote here, ‘We expect incentives to remain elevated for at least the remainder of the year’. PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is a leading homebuilder in the United States, engaged in acquiring and developing land for residential purposes and constructing a variety of housing options. In its third-quarter earnings report released on October 22, the company reported a net income of $698 million, which shows a rise from $639 million in the same period last year. The growth translated to earnings of $3.35 per share, up from $2.90 per share in the prior year. Home Sale revenues also saw a significant boost, climbing 12% to reach $4.3 billion. The company reported net new orders totaling 7,031 homes during the quarter, indicating strong demand in the housing market. At the close of the third quarter, its backlog comprised 12,089 homes valued at $7.7 billion. However, PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) faced challenges related to increased incentive costs, which impacted its profit margins. Incentives offered to buyers during the quarter reached 7%, marking a sequential increase of 70 basis points from the previous quarter. Management acknowledged that competitive market conditions necessitated higher incentives to maintain sales momentum and efficiently manage assets. Overall PHM ranks 11th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of PHM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PHM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Each of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research’s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence. The third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch and 10 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark. Wang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold. FAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let’s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Analyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. 2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry’s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider. On June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man’s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components. As Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence. ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket." Overall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Full Content:
Defending champions Cork Constitution and Clontarf meet again at Temple Hill on Saturday in a reprise of last April’s memorable semi-final which the home side won by 40-34, but in altogether different circumstances. While Clontarf lead the table and Con sit six points adrift in seventh place, both teams are seeking to bounce back from sobering defeats last week against Terenure and Lansdowne respectively. Con start the Munster academy and Emerging Ireland hooker Danny Sheahan and have also promoted Killian Coughlan at outside centre and lock Seán Duffy, as Matthew Bowen continues at fullback. Andy Wood has rotated his entire frontrow, with Barry Gray starting and the prolific Dylan Donnellan on the bench, while also promoting lock Jim Peters and centre Victor Allen. Terenure, a point behind Clontarf, start Fintan Gunne alongside fellow academy halfback Casper Gabriel for the first time at home to City of Armagh in a partnership rich with potential. Marcus Hanan starts at loosehead while Armagh bring in outhalf Evin Crummie, prop Niall Carville and backrower Barry Finn in a team featuring centre Sam Berman, the former St Michael’s and Irish Under-20 centre whose form with Terenure last season earned him an Ulster academy spot. Young Munster and Lansdowne, level on 10 points in sixth and fifth, meet at Tom Clifford Park. Munsters, beaten 26-25 at home by Ballynahinch as all six Limerick sides lost last week, bring in scrumhalf Jake O’Riordon and loosehead Peter Meyer. Without Cormac Foley and Charlie Tector, Lansdowne name James Kenny and James McMahon at halfback. There’s an interesting match-up in the Ballynahinch-Garryowen game where Ieland Sevens winger Zac Ward comes up against Garryowen’s Munster signing from Connacht, Diarmuid Kilgallen, after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Garryowen name Brian Gleeson as well as Academy halves Jack Oliver and Dylan Hicks. UCD welcome back centre Ben Brownlee and number eight Diarmuid Mangan to supplement a side containing fellow Leinster academy players Ruben Moloney, Rory McGuire, Conor Ó Tighearnaigh and Alan Spicer for the visit of St Mary’s, who make three changes up front but keep their potent backline intact. After last week’s big win in Nenagh Ormond to move top of 1B, Old Belvedere are on the road again, albeit just up the road to face Old Wesley in Donnybrook. Second-placed UCC are in Naas, Nenagh host Highfield and Blackrock head to Queen’s in what looks like a competitive and unpredictable division, witness the Thomond Park clash of two relegated sides, Shannon and Trinity, in a meeting of ninth and seventh. Something has to give in the pick of the 2A ties this season when Corinthians, average age just under 20, host Instonians on the Tuam Road, each having earned four bonus point wins. Corinthians’ more all-court game, orchestrated by outhalf Seán Naughton, inflicted one of just two defeats on Instonians in their last 40 AIL games at Corinthian Park last season, but the latter have a powerful maul; witness seven tries already by hooker Neil Saulters. Men’s Division 1A:_Ballynahinch v Garryowen, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Terenure v City of Armagh, Lakelands Paek; UCD v St. Mary’s College, Belfield; Young Munster v Lansdowne, Tom Clifford Park.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) continues its upward sprint, reaching a 52-week high of $236.29 during Thursday trading, with investors rallying behind the stock. The stock's meteoric rise—up 55% in the past month and 244% year-to-date—signals renewed investor confidence in the company's strategic mix of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) investments and AI-powered software advancements. Over the past year, MicroStrategy has soared an incredible 444%, and many are betting that this momentum will keep going. Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! A significant driver of the optimism comes from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), which recently expanded its stake to 5.2% in MicroStrategy, effectively placing a larger bet on the company's unique positioning as a gateway for institutional investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. With Bernstein analysts projecting Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end 2025, it seems BlackRock is bullish on the long-term outlook for both crypto and MicroStrategy. However, not everyone is celebrating. Noted Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has made headlines again, calling MSTR "the most overvalued stock in the MSCI World Index." Schiff warns that when the stock eventually crashes, it'll be a "real bloodbath." Known for advocating gold over Bitcoin, Schiff has long argued that crypto lacks the intrinsic value needed to sustain its current valuations. His sharp criticism adds a dose of skepticism to an otherwise optimistic narrative.

Chart created using Benzinga Pro The stock is currently trading well above its eight-, 20-, and 50-day simple moving averages, reflecting strong buying pressure and a bullish trend that shows no signs of weakening. With the share price at $235.89, MicroStrategy stock's eight-day simple moving average sits at $210.78, signaling continued strength. Similarly, the 20-day simple moving average is $193.16, and the 50-day SMA is $159.06, indicating that momentum is solid. The long-term trend is equally bullish. MicroStrategy's 200-day simple moving average is at $134.65, far below the current share price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stands at 18.66, another indicator of a buy signal, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 73.13, which indicates the stock is in overbought territory. See Also: Despite some warning signs—like the RSI suggesting possible overheating—the overall outlook for MicroStrategy remains positive, at least for now. The company's dual focus on Bitcoin and enterprise AI is winning over institutional players like BlackRock, while skeptics like Schiff continue to warn of an impending collapse. Will BlackRock's vote of confidence prove wise, or is Schiff's doomsday prediction around the corner? For now, MSTR is flying high, but in the wild world of Bitcoin, things can change in a flash.

Title: Microsoft tells shareholders to reject call to invest corporate cash in Bitcoin
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/25/microsoft-tells-shareholders-to-reject-call-to-invest-corporate-cash-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T19:02:30Z

As the year comes to an end, Microsoft plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting on December 10th. On this year’s list of “voting items” for shareholders is a proposal to diversify Microsoft’s assets and increase shareholder value by investing in Bitcoin, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Thursday. The company’s board of directors is urging shareholders to vote against it. The proposal titled “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” posits that Microsoft’s current investment in corporate bonds barely outpaces inflation rates and suggests that the company should consider diversifying their assets with Bitcoin, an “excellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation.” “Therefore, in inflationary times like these, corporations should—and perhaps have a fiduciary duty to—to diversify their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile in the short-term,” the proposal said. Beneath the proposal is a section labeled “Board Recommendation” in which Microsoft’s board of directors advises shareholders to vote against the proposal. The board explains that the company does not need to assess investing in Bitcoin because “Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic,” the filing said. The tech giant, whose largest shareholders are Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, says it has a Global Treasury and Investment Services team that regularly evaluates a vast array of potential investments to effectively diversify Microsoft’s assets and protect shareholders from inflation. This team has considered Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in past evaluations, Microsoft said in the filing. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted,” the filing said. The proposal was set forth by The National Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. The organization serves as an advisory board member of Project 2025, a far-right policy initiative to expand presidential power and impose a traditionalist social order under the next Republican administration. The proposal notes that while the company should consider investing in Bitcoin, it should not risk shareholder value by investing too much of their assets in the cryptocurrency. The organization suggests that Microsoft “evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.” This proposal comes as MicroStrategy, another large tech company, reaches a new high of $241 this year as the company’s strategic pivot toward Bitcoin investment pays off handsomely. The company has amassed 252,220 Bitcoins since 2020, worth about $17 billion. This has led MicroStrategy’s stock to surge 250% over the past year while Microsoft is up 16%. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Calls Michael Saylor’s View on Bitcoin Corporate Ownership ‘Insane’

Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin is not seeing eye to eye with Microstrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor when it comes to the custody of Bitcoin (BTC). In an interview, Saylor said that unlike with Bitcoin held by unregulated entities, lawmakers and law enforcement authorities are less likely to go after crypto held by regulated public entities such as financial titans BlackRock and JP Morgan. “I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” Buterin responded to Saylor’s statement, saying he does not share the same view about the corporate custody of Bitcoin. “I’ll happily say that I think Saylor’s comments are batshit insane. He seems to be explicitly arguing for a regulatory capture approach to protecting crypto (‘when you have regulated public entities like Blackrock and Fidelity and … holding the asset, all the lawmakers and law enforcement arms are invested in those entities’). There’s plenty of precedent for how this strategy can fail and for me, it’s not what crypto is about.” Following Buterin’s criticism, Saylor said anyone can choose however they want to hold their crypto assets. “I support self-custody for those willing & able, the right to self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody & custodian for individuals & institutions globally. Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Election 2024 coverage presented by Lazard (LAZ), a 175-year old global financial services and asset management company, is the latest among traditional financial players jumping on the asset tokenization trend, planning to create tokenized funds with Bitfinex Securities and SkyBridge Invest. The tokenized funds will be set up and issued under Kazakhstan's financial services law, under regulatory oversight of Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), where SkyBridge and Bitfinex are licensed to operate. Bitfinex Securities is responsible for the tokenization process, while SkyBridge will act as broker and manager of the tokenized fund. The products will be available to retail users, but with certain geographic limitations, and available to be purchased with Tether's stablecoin (USDT). Representatives of the companies involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) toward creating the tokenized funds on Friday in Lugano, Switzerland at a side event during the Plan B conference. The vehicle will offer exposure in a "fund of funds" structure to various existing Lazard-managed funds focused on global equities and emerging market equities, which have been available only to professional investors and institutions before, Matthias Kruse, managing director at Lazard, told CoinDesk. "We are a B2B [business-to-business] investment firm, and this is a good way for us to service retail investors," Kruse said. Kruse also touted tokenization as a process that improves efficiency, liquidity and helps lower operational costs. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a rapidly growing sector in the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance that involves placing assets such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. Participants do so in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency compared to traditional financial plumbing. The tokenization trend came to the forefront this year with global banks and asset managers, including BlackRock, HSBC starting offering tokenized products. The RWA market is poised to become a multi-trillion dollar market over the coming years, according to McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein. Lazard's asset management business has $245 billion of assets under management (AUM). SkyBridge Invest is a Kazakhstan-based investment services firm, different from SkyBridge Capital of veteran Wall Street hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Bitfinex Securities is a licensed trading venue in El Salvador and Kazakhstan. Bitfinex Securities is the tokenization platform arm of crypto trading venue Bitfinex. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

Title: Microsoft Board says no to Bitcoin: What’s behind the decision?

Microsoft’s board evaluates Bitcoin, but advises against adopting this strategy now. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting on the 10th of December is set to capture significant attention. A notable proposal for the tech giant to explore Bitcoin [BTC] investments will be a part of the meeting’s agenda. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microsoft’s board and shareholders will address several key issues at the meeting. These include the suggestion to adopt BTC as a hedge against inflation and broader economic shifts. However, Microsoft’s board has advised a vote against this proposal, stating that the company has already given careful consideration to such strategies, according to the filing. As outlined in a company statement opposing the proposal, Microsoft emphasized its stance against Bitcoin investment. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making.” This proposal, initiated by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), pointed to MicroStrategy’s notable Bitcoin investment approach, which it claims has outperformed Microsoft’s stock by over 300% in the past year despite the smaller scale of MicroStrategy’s operations. The NCPPR also highlighted the growing trend of institutional and corporate interest in BTC. This included through spot Bitcoin ETFs, and argued that, although Bitcoin remains volatile, it could act as a potential hedge against inflation and declining corporate bond yields. ”At minimum, companies should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.” BTC institutional holdings has grown remarkably, with top players like Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy all steadily increasing their stakes in the leading cryptocurrency. Hence, the race to secure Bitcoin has intensified to the point where BTC ETFs are nearing the total holdings attributed to Nakamoto, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In fact, MicroStrategy’s prominent Bitcoin acquisition strategy has further inspired entities such as Japan’s Metaplanet. The organization recently raised 10 billion Yen through a fresh stock issuance as part of its 11th series of Stock Acquisition Rights. Tesla’s Q3 report also underscored its role as the fourth-largest BTC holder among U.S.-listed firms, trailing MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms. Moreover, SpaceX’s 8,285 BTC—valued at roughly $560 million—cements its position as the seventh-largest private Bitcoin holder. As of the 25th of October, BTC was trading at $67,576.65, showing a 1.02% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In contrast, Microsoft (MSFT) shares saw minimal movement, closing at $424.7 on the 24th of October with a slight uptick of 0.03%, per Google Finance. By the 25th of October, MSFT shares had inched up further to $424.73, marking a modest 0.13% rise.

Jeremiah Owyang Above: SAP Labs hosted Llama Lounge 14 in downtown SF, with hundreds of AI founders. Yet another amazing event in San Francisco for hundreds of AI startup founders, venture capitalists, corporate ventures, and corporate AI leaders who wanted to partner with top AI startups.I heard that people have been selling Llama Lounge tickets on a secondary market (don’t do that, as they are non-transferrable) and some startups tout that getting a demo slot is akin to being at a top accelerator, as they have to win the slot out of 700 submissions and growing.

Title: ‘Money in Exchange for Silence’: Behind Neom’s Green Image, Western Firms Cash in on Saudi Commitment to Oil

Lambert here: Strong original reporting from DeSmog. Every so often, Saudi propaganda for Neom comes across my feed, and it’s obviously a grandiose real estate development signaling some sort of horrid end state; the very last thing the Saudi people need is an indoor ski resort. But I didn’t realize how grandiose. Ka-ching ka-ching. By Adam M. Lowenstein, a freelance journalist and writer covering the climate crisis, capitalism, and corporate power. A former Capitol Hill aide and U.S. Senate speechwriter, his work has also appeared in The Atlantic, The Guardian, The American Prospect, The Lever, and other publications. Originally published at DeSmog. The video opens with the voice of a child. “Since the beginning, we’ve changed things,” she says. “It’s in our genes. It’s what makes us human.” The viewer zooms through stages in human development — agriculture, science, air travel, space flight. A dramatic musical score rises steadily in volume. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” the narrator intones, as the camera comes to rest on a blank canvas. After a beat, water explodes across the screen, soaking the frame. “Let’s change water,” she says, “so it flows forever. Energy, so it powers our lives sustainably.” From climate change and food security to aging and mobility, the video proceeds topic by topic, issuing an inspiring call to action — one seen more than 22 million times on YouTube, and by countless others on massive screens in New York City’s Times Square. “This is where we can change it all,” the narrator intones. “Neom,” she concludes, is “made to change.” “Neom” is the brainchild and flagship construction project of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the ruler-in-waiting and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. Designed hand-in-hand with elite Western consulting firms McKinsey & Company, Oliver Wyman, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and named for a combination of “neo” and “mustaqbal” — the Greek and Arabic words for “new” and “future” — Neom is portrayed as a futuristic, emissions-free utopia in the country’s northwest Tabuk province, which sits along the coast of the Red Sea. The mega-development is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed and owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, which the crown prince also chairs. As the “made to change” video suggests, Neom’s promotional efforts often consist of fanciful digital renderings of luxurious resorts and futuristic cityscapes replete with lush greenery, vibrant natural wonders, and promises of ecological and environmental preservation. “Sustainability is a very big theme in everything that we do,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told an audience in Rio de Janeiro in June. Fayez was addressing an event organized by the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute, a PIF-led nonprofit that convenes investors and global power players in cities around the world. Some of America’s wealthiest investors and chief executives will be speaking at this year’s flagship FII gathering known as “Davos in the Desert” — which will take place in the Saudi capital of Riyadh from October 29-31 — including Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google; Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the private equity giant Blackstone; and Larry Fink, CEO of the asset manager BlackRock. The FII Institute counts Neom as a “strategic partner.” Paradoxically for a project cloaked in green branding, Neom — or at least the idea of Neom — has emerged as an important asset in the Saudi government’s campaign to preserve global demand for fossil fuels. “Mohammed bin Salman wants to be part of this … global concern with the climate,” said Madawi Al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics (LSE) Middle East Centre. “But also, let’s not forget that the [Saudi] economy is based on oil, and this is one of the most polluting industries that you can imagine. … The whole country’s based on an oil company. They have to show that they’re diversifying, investing in other things.” This dilemma has made Neom a core plank in Crown Prince Mohammed’s plan for the future of Saudi Arabia. Known as “Vision 2030,” the McKinsey–conceived roadmap ostensibly charts a course for the country to open itself to the world — primarily through tourism and foreign investment — while reducing its dependence on oil. Key to this transformation is an aggressive rebrand of the kingdom as a leader in the global fight against climate change. It is a delicate challenge to portray the world’s largest oil exporter — and a documented opponent of global climate action, particularly at UN climate talks — as a champion of sustainability. But it is not a challenge that the Saudi government is attempting alone. DeSmog found that at least two-dozen communications firms mentioned in this story — including agencies specializing in PR, consulting, advertising, and video and graphic design — have together earned tens of millions of dollars helping Crown Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government develop and sell the idea of Neom. To build up a picture of these companies’ activities, DeSmog reviewed hundreds of internal company documents; industry award submissions and press releases; social media posts and case studies published by staff and executives at Neom and many of the individual firms; as well as thousands of pages of documents filed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). (The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires American companies who advocate or lobby for foreign governments to disclose information about those activities, as well as the names of the employees involved in them, to the DOJ.) If Neom’s marketing materials are to be believed, the city will soon offer a globally integrated, carbon-free home for billions of dollars’ worth of investor capital and millions of people from around the world, thanks to engineering and urban development marvels like The Line, a 170-kilometer-long, 500-meter-tall city “powered by 100 percent clean energy,” and Trojena, a mountainous region that promises to deploy cloud seeding to create an outdoor ski resort in the desert. The Line provides “a blueprint for how people and planet can co-exist in harmony,” says a Neom press release distributed by Chicago-headquartered Edelman, one of the largest PR agencies in the world. Trojena, which is scheduled to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029, “confirms our commitment to be part of the global effort to protect the environment,” Crown Prince Mohammed says in another release, this one distributed by the New York City-based communications firm Teneo. In fact, all of Neom’s regions and projects “will be aligned in their respect for the environment and achieving balance, because Neom’s ambitious vision seeks to shape the future in which living and working are integrated in a sustainable way,” Teneo’s release says. Edelman distributed this press release and graphic in early 2021 as part of its promotion of The Line. Edelman included the image with a Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing to the U.S. Department of Justice. Experts told DeSmog that whether or not Neom is ever built, the reward for the Saudi government of involving so many prestigious firms goes beyond branding the country as green and legitimizing the crown prince’s hold on power. The scale of Western entanglement creates a financial dependence on Saudi largesse that makes it more difficult for these firms to disengage from Saudi Arabia — or for business leaders and government officials to speak out publicly — because of the Saudi state’s human rights abuses, its repression of civil and political liberties, or its efforts to obstruct global climate negotiations. Following the October 2018 abduction and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that Crown Prince Mohammed “approved,” according to a U.S. intelligence assessment — Western elites’ shunning of the kingdom ultimately proved as fleeting as their governments’ promises to isolate the crown prince. But the outcry, while short-lived, nonetheless served as a wake-up call for the crown prince and his allies, experts said, particularly as the government has faced criticism over allegations of forcibly evicting residents of the Tabuk province to make space for Neom. “What they want is to create a substantial Western interest and personnel in Saudi Arabia in order to make Saudi Arabia defended by Western interests, should Saudi Arabia need that,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “If you have a big population of Westerners in a country … then it becomes like a satellite state that has to be protected because Western interests are really intertwined with the local economy, and you can’t just abandon your people.” The crown prince is “thinking about alternative ways of keeping Western interests alive in Saudi Arabia,” Al-Rasheed said. “These projects, these consultancy firms, the PR companies are all meant to create that bondage — an alternative to just one commodity, and that is oil.” I. A ‘Golden Cash Cow’: Elite Agencies Capitalize on Neom According to the documents reviewed by DeSmog, the list of firms that have signed contracts with Neom includes some of the world’s biggest marketing, advertising, and communications conglomerates and their subsidiaries, such as: Independent agencies, such as Edelman, Teneo, KARV (formerly KARV Communications), Ruder Finn, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have together won millions of dollars’ worth of additional work for Neom, as have countless smaller creative agencies, many headquartered in New York City and London. This list of companies working to shape Neom’s image, which is not comprehensive, omits many of the lobbying and public affairs firms that work to shape the Saudis’ reputation in Washington, DC and other capitals. It also omits the 23 architecture studios shaping the city’s actual construction, according to a tally compiled by the architecture publication Dezeen. Other U.S.-based companies, including FleishmanHillard and Prosek Partners, have been hired by the FII Institute, which frequently promotes Neom at its events. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of the PIF and the chairman of the board of Saudi Aramco, the country’s state-run oil giant, also serves as chairman of the FII Institute. (There is no indication that FleishmanHillard, which is part of Omnicom, or Prosek Partners have worked for Neom directly.) The FII Institute is run by Richard Attias, a former Publicis Groupe executive and longtime producer of the World Economic Forum (WEF), an annual gathering for global elites in Davos, Switzerland. These days Attias, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family, and his communications firm, Richard Attias & Associates, are largely known for hosting the FII’s “Davos in the Desert” in Riyadh. (The crown prince publicly launched Neom at the gathering in 2017.) Beyond the FII, however, Attias and his company have also done significant work for Neom, including organizing “Discover Neom” tours to solicit foreign investment in cities ranging from Boston and Miami to Berlin, Paris, and Seoul, according to news reports and social media posts. The PR agency KARV’s work for Neom, which remains ongoing, is also run through Attias’s company. A spokesperson for the office of Richard Attias told DeSmog in an email that Richard Attias & Associates “is a global strategic communications and events firm that works with more than 50 clients worldwide annually, including Neom. We have provided events services for the Discover Neom Roadshows from 2022 to 2023, and communications advisory since 2023.” The FII Institute, the spokesperson said, “counts more than 30 international and regional entities as strategic partners, and Neom is indeed one of them.” * * * DeSmog’s findings suggest that many PR and consulting companies have anchored themselves in the lucrative ecosystem of Neom and the Saudi government, in part by capitalizing on Crown Prince Mohammed’s desire to be perceived as taking action on climate change. Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the nonprofit DAWN (Democracy for the Arab World Now), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit that was co-founded by Jamal Khashoggi, said the Saudi government is willing to spend vast amounts of money for purported Western expertise with little oversight. Put simply, Neom contracts are a “golden cash cow,” Whitson said. (One Neom-focused job opening in London, which was posted by a Publicis subsidiary, appealed to potential applicants by describing Neom as a client offering “unlimited content budgets.”) In conversations with DeSmog, a former employee of a sustainability-focused subsidiary of one of the world’s biggest communications conglomerates described witnessing an aggressive, even desperate, push to win a contract with Neom. The pitch, which eventually involved some of the conglomerate’s most senior executives, was for work to promote one of Neom’s widely touted environmental projects. The advertising agency’s history of working with clients seeking to advance their climate and environmental goals formed a key part of its appeal. The former employee, who requested to share their story anonymously for fear of professional repercussions, expressed concerns to executives within the agency that Neom could be largely a greenwashing exercise for a government funded by, and committed to, oil extraction. The former employee also cautioned that the firm, by doing this work for Neom, could contribute to sanitizing the Saudi government’s human rights record. When this employee shared their concerns internally, they were told that the agency’s participation in the pitch was vital because the agency had such a strong reputation for sustainability. After escalating concerns to more senior executives throughout the company, the former employee came to believe that they had been silenced and excluded from the project. Eventually, the employee chose to leave the company after concluding that their position was no longer tenable — and that their concerns about sustainability and human rights, despite featuring prominently in the company’s code of conduct, would continue to be ignored. As this employee’s experience suggests, for the Western creatives and communicators cashing in on Neom contracts, whether Neom’s flagship projects are actually green — or whether they are even ever likely to exist — appears to be of secondary importance to the task of portraying them that way. For these companies, “why not get in on the action? It’s easy money, with more to come,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson. II. ‘A Blank Canvas’: Crafting a Convenient Narrative In response to a series of detailed questions, as well as requests for an interview and comments for this story, a spokesperson for Neom emailed a statement to DeSmog: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Neom is supporting that goal by investing in emerging green technologies, including hydrogen production at scale, such as the world’s largest hydrogen plant … We are also committed to making our developments net zero emission zones upon completion, as we continue to focus on leveraging 100 percent renewable energy sources with sun and wind being abundant in this region of Saudi Arabia. In the construction phase of our developments, we are focused on decarbonizing, with the integration of circular economy principles including the use of carbon capture and utilization technology in our cement manufacturing plants. “Sustainability is deeply woven into Neom’s ethos, values, business practices, and operations. One of our core commitments is to preserve 95 percent of Neom for nature. We are also regreening and rewilding native landscapes as part of our Neom Nature Reserve. Five native species have already been reintroduced to two native habitat zones, and more than three million trees, shrubs, and grasses have been planted across 750 hectares as part of our program to restore extensive natural habitats with 100 million native plants.” In addition to Neom, as part of this investigation DeSmog contacted the firms mentioned in the story to request interviews and comments about their work for Neom. DeSmog also submitted a comment request to the Saudi embassy in Washington, DC. Most firms either declined to comment or did not respond. The embassy also did not respond. In order to work for the Saudi government, many companies agree to aggressive confidentiality and nondisclosure terms. Earlier this year, for instance, McKinsey, Teneo, M. Klein & Company, and BCG defied a subpoena from the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which was examining the Saudi government’s efforts to influence U.S. policy through tactics such as “sportswashing,” telling senators that Saudi officials would not allow them to discuss their work. “It’s simply staggering to me that American companies are not only willing to accept this claim, allowing the Saudi government to determine what is permitted to provide this subcommittee, but also that they would use it to justify their refusal to comply with a duly-issued congressional subpoena,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, the chairman of the subcommittee, said in a prepared statement for a February hearing with executives of the four firms. Despite these strident nondisclosure terms, however, some companies have been more vocal about their work for Neom on their websites and on social media. “From introducing a new model for urban sustainability powered by 100 percent renewable energy to creating hyper-connected communities centered around nature, not roads — [Neom’s] ‘living laboratories’ will embrace technology and innovation at scale to enhance liveability and answer some of humanity’s most urgent challenges,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a case study about its role in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Designed to inspire, it offers a tantalizing glimpse of what the future could look like.” Slides from The Story of NEOM, an internal document created for Neom by McCann Worldgroup. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation stated. McCann Enterprise is part of the global network McCann Worldgroup, which itself is the creator of a 168-slide presentation titled “THE STORY OF NEOM.” This internal document, which was obtained by DeSmog, features detailed overviews of Neom’s regions and provides promotional language and graphics that have appeared repeatedly across Neom’s website, social media activity, videos, and other materials. The words “sustainable” and “sustainability” together appear 58 times throughout the document. McCann Worldgroup declined to comment. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation states — a message McCann Enterprise has carried forth in much of its work for Neom. In the case study about the “made to change” video (part of what the agency called a “spectacular” campaign), McCann Enterprise described Neom as “a place designed to concentrate and accelerate the human drive for progress.” The city, the company said, is “a blank canvas for a new era of sustainable living.” “The creative idea from McCann London positions Neom as a change-maker that will inspire the world as it reimagines a healthier, more responsible, efficient, sustainable, and balanced way of life, starting from a blank canvas,” echoes a LinkedIn post by Joy Films, a production company that worked on the “made to change” video and has been involved in promoting numerous Neom projects. The “blank canvas” narrative is one that the Saudi government has promoted eagerly. “Since we have [an] empty place, and we want to have a place for 10 million people, then let’s think from scratch,” Crown Prince Mohammed said in a 2023 documentary about The Line on Discovery UK. The “blank canvas” in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” says the narrator, as water explodes across the screen and drenches the canvas. But the Tabuk province in northwest Saudi Arabia, where pieces of Neom are slowly being built, was neither blank nor empty before it was claimed for the city’s construction. The land’s longtime residents include members of the Huwaitat tribe, who the Saudi government began forcibly evicting at the beginning of 2020, according to a report from the international nonprofit ALQST for Human Rights. The tribal community, whose members had lived for centuries in what Western creative agencies repeatedly portray as empty, “was terrorized into submission,” DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson told DeSmog. “[We] haven’t heard a peep from them since.” ALQST has documented that at least 15 Huwaitat people who opposed being displaced for Neom’s “blank canvas” have been sentenced “to prison terms of between 15 and 50 years.” Another five have been sentenced to death. In 2020 Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti, a prominent Huwaitat protestor, was killed by Saudi special forces in his home. Earlier this year a former Saudi intelligence official told the BBC that the government had “licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home.” The forced eviction of the Huwaitat tribe and the death of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti have not captured global attention in the same way as the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. But these developments have nevertheless been widely reported in the media and publicized by human rights advocates. In May 2023, a group of independent experts appointed by the UN warned that three members of the Huwaitat tribe were facing “imminent execution” for opposing their eviction for The Line. “We urge all companies involved, including foreign investors, to ensure that they are not causing or contributing to, and are not directly linked to, serious human rights abuses,” the UN experts wrote. A handful of companies have proven willing to walk away from Saudi contracts. In July 2018, Gladstone Place Partners, an independent New York City-based communications firm, signed a nearly $200,000 agreement to promote Neom in U.S. markets and introduce the city’s CEO to Fortune magazine and other “top-tier media.” Gladstone terminated the contract shortly after Khashoggi’s disappearance. More recently, Malcolm Aw, the CEO of the renewable energy firm Solar Water, told Business Insider that he scrapped a $100 million contract with Neom to build solar-powered water desalination plants in the city after learning of the government’s aggressive eviction of the Huwaitat people. But rather than walking away, most Western companies doing business with Neom appear to have chosen the more lucrative path of looking the other way, a pattern that appears likely to continue. “Spreading such large amounts of capital … through such a broad spectrum of elite American companies precludes that kind of blowback from happening again,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson, referring to the global backlash that followed Khashoggi’s murder in 2018. In fact, the Saudi government’s explicit commitment to extracting fossil fuels and obstructing global climate diplomacy, as well as its human rights abuses, ongoing political repression, and intolerance of dissent — such as decades-long prison terms for social media posts critical of Neom or the government itself — seem only to have created more demand for elite reputation cleansing. One PR industry award framed that challenge as an opportunity: “The global sentiment around Neom … was one rooted in cynicism and confusion rather than excitement.” III. ‘What is Neom?’: A Sprawling Web of Contracts In 2023, the year after it painted Neom as “made to change,” McCann Enterprise returned for another piece of work, this time to present Google searchers, YouTube streamers, and social media scrollers with the question of “what is Neom?” — and then align their answers with a Neom-approved narrative. As it had during the “made to change” campaign, the London agency teamed up with Monks, a “digital operating brand” of S4Capital, an advertising and marketing company founded by Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP. (Neom is “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen,” Sir Martin wrote of “made to change.”) Monks referred DeSmog to its statement on modern slavery and its code of conduct. Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP, posted to his LinkedIn account in December 2021 that Neom was “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen.” Additional contributors to the new campaign included Google; Mathematic, a Paris-headquartered design studio that had also worked on videos for Trojena; Whisper, a UK-based production company; and Starcom, Leo Burnett, and Saatchi & Saatchi – all subsidiaries of the French holding group Publicis. Whisper and McCann Enterprise had previously collaborated on videos for Tonomus, Neom’s so-called “hyperconnected cognitive city,” which both Edelman and the DC lobbying shop Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have also helped promote. “What is Neom?” featured a particularly close partnership between Neom and Google Creative Works, an operation within the tech giant that helps companies monetize Google users’ data and attention. According to a February 2024 case study written by a former Neom marketing executive and published by Google, “what is Neom?” sought to use detailed tracking and targeting of browsing behavior by Google search and YouTube users to change how viewers thought about Neom. The campaign’s entry point was a series of “15-second teaser video ads” on YouTube and other platforms. If viewers engaged with the teaser videos, they were then “automatically shown” a longer video that “used simple, conversational language to demystify the complexity of the Neom project, which was critical to the campaign’s storytelling element,” the case study said. Many of the videos emphasized Neom’s environmental claims. Neom is “an entirely new model for sustainable living,” stated one video. “Call it what you want, but it’s a place that’s going to change the way we live on this planet,” said another. Parts of two industry award submissions by Monks (top) and McCann Enterprise (bottom) for their work on the “What Is Neom?” campaign. Creating the campaign involved “an incredibly fast turnaround shoot that spanned the globe,” said one Whisper employee in an interview published on LinkedIn. “A real feat of impressive logistics delivered by the team!” For McCann Enterprise’s part, the “what is Neom?” videos involved a team of at least 14 employees, according to a celebratory LinkedIn post by the company’s chief creative officer. “Exaggerated and negative commentary overwhelms the media and online landscape, drowning out credible information about many topics including Neom,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a separate case study. “We needed to bring the truth to the front page. And today’s front page is the Google results page.” According to McCann Enterprise, for the 2023 project it hired Ipsos, a survey firm, in part to track Neom’s “brand health.” In May, a few months after “what is Neom?” launched, some journalists opened their inboxes to find that they were being asked to fill out an “Ipsos Survey for Neom.” The request came from KARV, the independent PR agency based in New York City. (It is unclear whether the Ipsos survey distributed by KARV is the same one referenced in the McCann Enterprise case study.) Earlier that year, KARV had signed a $980,000 contract to provide “Neom leadership” with “strategic communications and media relations,” including “strategic positioning counsel” and “messaging and editorial support,” via Richard Attias & Associates. This wasn’t KARV’s first time doing business with the Saudi government. In February 2019, barely four months after Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance, KARV head Andrew Frank personally signed a contract with the PIF. Crown Prince Mohammed’s position as chair of the investment fund means it is effectively controlled by him. The PIF “is just MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] himself,” Abdullah Alaoudh, the senior director for countering authoritarianism at the DC-based Middle East Democracy Center, told DeSmog. “I don’t know why they call it [a] sovereign wealth fund. It’s just MBS’s wealth fund, basically.” (KARV’s work for the PIF would eventually bring in more than $3 million.) A portion of KARV Communications’ contract with the Public Investment Fund. KARV’s CEO personally signed the contract in February 2019, barely four months after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi government agents. In a statement emailed to DeSmog, a KARV spokesperson said, “KARV works in conjunction with Richard Attias & Associates in providing strategic communications, messaging, and media relations support to Neom as it aims to address the world’s greatest challenges through advancements in healthcare, education, economic opportunity, and sustainability.” * * * Among the numerous projects that “what is Neom?” sought to introduce to the world was Trojena, Neom’s ski resort and one of its most heavily promoted endeavors. In fact, another arm of McCann Worldgroup had already been involved in Trojena: In early 2022, around the same time that McCann Enterprise was portraying Neom as “made to change,” the U.S.-based McCann New York had been gearing up to help launch the mountain resort. Trojena, according to the “STORY OF NEOM” internal branding document created by McCann Worldgroup and obtained by DeSmog, will house “The Vault,” a “folding village” and “vertical city inside of a mountain with its own microclimate,” as well as “the first outdoor ski resort in Saudi Arabia” with “30 km of planned ski slopes.” Slides about Trojena from McCann Worldgroup’s internal branding document, The Story of Neom. To bring this implausible-sounding concept to life, McCann New York worked with Joy Films — which was also involved in the “made to change” and “what is Neom?” campaigns — to create a video portraying a group of skiers and snowboarders racing uphill in the snow, through an avalanche, before shooting into the sky under the slogan, “journey to new heights.” The video has racked up more than 17 million views on YouTube, though experts cautioned that these numbers are to be interpreted with some skepticism, given the Saudi government’s record of using bots and troll farms to boost social media numbers and harass critics. Neom also took the companies’ work beyond social media. With the help of Pixel Artworks, a UK-based “immersive experience” company, Neom splashed the agencies’ Trojena imagery across huge moving billboards in Riyadh, Times Square, and London’s Piccadilly Circus. On LinkedIn, Neom touted its massive Times Square billboards promoting Trojena in this April 13, 2022 post. A wide array of firms, including Teneo, McCann New York, Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, Squint/Opera, and KARV, are among the firms that have been paid by Neom to promote Trojena. This campaign put Neom’s commitment to sustainability front and center. Sometimes the message was implicit: Winter sports, by definition, require water and cold temperatures. Other times, the agencies were more direct. “Trojena will redefine mountain tourism for the world by creating a place based on the principles of ecotourism, highlighting our efforts to preserve nature and enhance the community’s quality of life,” read one unattributed quote included in a case study published by Squint/Opera, a UK-based creative shop owned by the U.S. agency Journey. The same quote was also attributed to Crown Prince Mohammed in a press release — distributed by Teneo — that accompanied Trojena’s launch. The release also quoted Nadhmi Al-Nasr, Neom’s CEO, describing Trojena as “a major contribution to achieving Neom’s long-term ambitions by adhering to the principles of sustainability.” Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, and Squint/Opera have each won other contracts with Neom. All three, for instance, have promoted The Line; Pixel Artworks says its video about the hypothetical horizontal city has generated more than 157 million YouTube views. And many continue to generate revenue from Neom. In March, Joy Films posted a video on Instagram about its ongoing work for Elanan, Neom’s “unique wellness retreat embedded in nature.” (KARV and Teneo have also promoted Elanan.) Whether projects like Elanan, Trojena, and The Line actually come to life or remain in the digital realm of slide decks and social media promises, the image of Neom — and the sprawling, interconnected web of contracts that helps create that image — serves an important function for the Saudi government. “I think what happened with Neom is that there’s so much money at stake that … what it managed to do is to buy people’s silence, including companies and states,” Lina Alhathloul, the head of monitoring and advocacy for ALQST, told DeSmog. Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, an activist for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, was jailed by the government for more than three years and is still banned from leaving the country. “Everyone [is] accepting Saudi money in exchange for silence,” Lina Alhathloul said. IV. ‘Hydrocarbons…for Many, Many Decades to Come’: A Kingdom Committed to Oil In January 2024, Neom invited investors, politicians, corporate executives, and other attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos to drop by “Neom House,” a pop-up space branded with Neom’s logo and emblazoned with environmental imagery. Some of the building’s walls appeared to be covered in greenery. A nearly floor-to-ceiling graphic described Neom as “redefining the circular economy” and “powered by 100 percent clean energy.” Interactive screens showed visitors how Neom would “redefine livability, business, and conservation,” Neom later said. A look inside “Neom house” at the World Economic Forum in 2024. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Throughout the week, Neom House, which was designed in part by the same Pixel Artworks that had done work for Trojena and The Line, hosted a series of conversations about the city’s progress and potential. Many of these events seemed designed to create the image of a government leading the fight for global climate action. (Among those touting the promise of Neom to investors was Eric Cantor, the former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.) Despite the green imagery and messaging surrounding the events, some officials who spoke at Neom House offered a different take on the government’s climate agenda. During a discussion about “mitigation through proactive action,” Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs — and, since 2022, the country’s climate envoy — told the audience, “We want to be a realistic partner, and we want the world to be realistic,” employing a common rhetorical tactic of Saudi officials to caricature calls for the phase-out of fossil fuels as naïve or a “fantasy.” “We are saying that hydrocarbons will be the main source of energy for the world for many, many decades to come,” Al-Jubeir said. Flanked by a banner reading “Redefining Life for People and Planet,” Saudi climate envoy Adel Al-Jubeir (left) told Neom deputy CEO Rayan Fayez (right) that the Saudi government believed in “hydrocarbons… for many, many decades to come,” at a talk held in “NEOM house” during the 2024 World Economic Forum. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of oil in the world. Nearly two-thirds of government revenues stem from oil. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant valued at around $2 trillion, is one of the world’s most valuable and most profitable companies. The kingdom controls around 82 percent of Aramco; the PIF, which owns Neom, also owns around 16 percent of Aramco — a stake worth around $160 billion. (McCann Worldgroup, Hill & Knowlton, Publicis, BCW, IPG, Mathematic, and FleishmanHillard are among the Western advertising and PR firms named in this story that have also worked for Aramco. The oil giant has also spent millions of dollars on sponsored content deals with the in-house creative studios of Western media outlets, including the New York Times, Financial Times and Reuters, in recent years, according to previous reporting by DeSmog and Drilled). “We’re trying to redefine how businesses coexist with nature,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told Richard Attias at a 2023 FII Institute event. “Everything that we’re doing today at Neom has nature and environment at the core.” Yet the city’s construction is funded by oil sales, and the government’s entire operating model — including its investments in Neom and the crown prince’s other “giga-projects,” such as Diriyah, a $63 billion tourism development that will supposedly boast 38 hotels, and Jeddah Central, a waterfront project for which the Saudi government has also faced criticism for forcibly evicting local residents — depends on continuing to sell as much oil as possible, for as long as possible. “The crown prince [is] worried about all this talk about climate change and renewable energy — all of that creates tension in his mind because Saudi Arabia depends on selling oil,” LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed told DeSmog. “If oil becomes the ‘bad’ energy, then he’s stuck.” That’s why, even as Saudi policymakers work to reduce the kingdom’s own reliance on fossil fuels — an aim Neom might in fact support if its solar energy, desalination, “green” hydrogen, and other renewable energy projects come to fruition — the kingdom continues to work diligently to obstruct efforts that could reduce global demand for oil. In a 2008 paper, Cambridge University scholar Joanna Depledge summed up the Saudi government’s approach to international climate negotiations as “striving for no.” Thanks to its negotiators’ savvy tactics, including sowing disagreements among different countries, challenging established science about climate change, promoting false solutions to the crisis, and leveraging procedural rules and objections to stall discussions, “Saudi Arabia has been extremely successful in diverting the agenda and debates of the climate change government away from those issues it opposes, and towards those it supports,” Depledge argued. More than 15 years later, Depledge told DeSmog that what she wrote in that 2008 paper “nearly all still applies.” The Saudi government “has a thirty-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector, and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible,” Depledge and two co-authors wrote in 2023. “From Saudi Arabia’s perspective, ambitious global climate action is … more of a threat than climate change itself.” Last year the nonprofit Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) revealed the existence of a Saudi government effort, known as the Oil Demand Sustainability Program, which “aims to boost oil consumption across Asia and Africa, with the ultimate goal of protecting Saudi oil revenues from efforts to phase out fossil fuels,” CCR’s Lawrence Carter and Tom Costello wrote. At last year’s UN climate summit, meanwhile, Saudi negotiators “flatly opposed any language in a deal that would even mention fossil fuels,” the New York Times reported. (Saudi Arabia is reportedly one of a group of oil-dependent countries already working to make sure the upcoming UN summit in Azerbaijan does not call for a global phaseout of fossil fuels, according to the Financial Times.) While Saudi Arabia is far from the only country committed to obstructing and delaying climate action, its efforts have proven particularly successful and, as Depledge and her co-authors noted, provided cover for the United States other nations that benefit from continued fossil fuel production but would rather not be seen as spoilers. Then there’s the environmental impact of Neom itself. Despite the rhetoric and imagery pushed by the city and its Western consultants, experts and observers are skeptical that many of Neom’s projects can match their green hype. The Line, for instance, “will require a truly colossal quantity of materials, with emissions likely much higher than those produced in building a typical city,” predicted Philip Oldfield, a professor of architecture at the University of New South Wales in an opinion piece in the New York Times. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Neom was building multiple gas power plants “to power the region until greener energy is sourced.” “Trojena is a ski resort with fake snow. ‘Preserve the environment’ when you need to create new snow? It’s just not credible,” ALQST’s Lina Alhathloul told DeSmog. “The Line actually cuts the environment and removes all [of] the nature and all of the animals. It removes it completely.” Trojena and The Line are “the two most famous projects in Neom,” Alhathloul said, and “the two main projects are clearly not green.” V. ‘A Model for Sustainable Living’: Cashing in on the Idea of Neom While Western companies have been eager partners in portraying Trojena, The Line, and other Neom endeavors as green, many have proven equally adept at transforming their work for Neom into contracts with other parts of the Saudi government. In 2020, the independent agency Ruder Finn agreed to a $1.7 million deal to promote Neom’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, including by creating videos that “tell the story of CSR and its impact on the beneficiaries and the local community.” In the contract, Ruder Finn described itself as “a women-owned business with a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion.” Members of the LGBTQ community routinely face repression by the Saudi government. Lina Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, remains one of numerous women’s rights activists in detention. “Saudi Arabia’s own record on women’s rights is abysmal,” Amnesty International’s Sherine Tadros told the Guardian. (Ruder Finn declined to comment.) Portions of Ruder Finn’s 2020 contract with Neom. A few years after wrapping up its work for Neom, Ruder Finn notified the DOJ that the firm had signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide “strategic counsel, media relations, media monitoring, and content strategy and creation.” Kathy Bloomgarden, Ruder Finn’s CEO, personally registered with the DOJ to work on both contracts. Edelman, another independent firm that also began working for Neom in 2020, followed a similar path. According to DOJ filings, the company’s first contract with Neom, signed in November 2020, was expected to generate $75,000 a month for three months — a small sum for a firm that would bring in $840 million in revenue that year. Since then, however, Edelman has signed at least a dozen additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom and the Saudi government. Together these projects appear likely to generate more than $10.8 million for the firm, according to DeSmog’s analysis. As with Ruder Finn, Edelman’s work for Neom appears to have opened the door to work for other Saudi government agencies — and involved the firm’s most senior executive. In July 2022, Richard Edelman, Edelman’s CEO, hosted an invitation-only breakfast for Joseph Bradley, the head of Tonomus, one of Neom’s flagship projects. A few months later Richard Edelman registered with the DOJ as a foreign agent representing the Saudi culture ministry. The following year Richard Edelman hosted another “roundtable breakfast,” this time as part of the firm’s work promoting a “sustainable tourism” initiative for the Saudi tourism ministry. A July 8, 2022 invitation to a breakfast hosted by Richard Edelman for the CEO of Tonomous, one of Neom’s flagship projects. Edelman included the email in a FARA filing to the Justice Department. In response to a request for comment, Edelman referred DeSmog to its human rights policy and its public report on “citizenship.” In May 2023, Neom Green Hydrogen Company — a joint venture between Neom, Air Products, and ACWA Power, which itself is partly owned by the Saudi PIF — announced an $8.4 billion investment valuation for a “green” hydrogen plant located in Oxagon, a floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” (Edelman, Teneo, and Landor have also promoted Oxagon.) Hill & Knowlton, a U.S.-based firm, appears to have won industry awards for its work for Neom Green Hydrogen Company, including a campaign titled “Pioneering a green hydrogen future,” which won an industry award for “Best Campaign Demonstrating Environmental Initiatives.” Hill & Knowlton is listed as a media contact in an Air Products filing with the U.S. government. Earlier this year Hill & Knowlton merged with BCW to form Burson, which itself is part of London-headquarted WPP, one of the world’s largest communications conglomerates. According to federal filings, ASDA’A BCW, a subsidiary of BCW, signed its first contract with the Saudi government in January 2017, before linking up with Neom in the spring of 2020 for $390,000 worth of work. Burson is not the only WPP subsidiary to work for Neom. Landor (formerly Landor & Fitch) “worked through 24-hour shifts” to create Neom’s “brand idea and narrative,” according to a case study written by the company. Landor has been supporting Neom “since 2017,” one executive said last year, and has “many more Neom projects in the pipeline.” Landor Global posted to X on Nov. 18, 2021 about Oxagon, Neom’s floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” Edelman, Teneo, and Hill & Knowlton are among the other firms that have been paid to promote Oxagon. VI. ‘You Want to Maintain That Image’: Perception Is Reality The web of Western agencies’ involvement with the Saudi government can appear endless, likely with stronger and more numerous connections than will ever become public. Even so, one firm stands out for its success cashing in on the idea of Neom. According to federal filings with the DOJ, the strategy consulting firm Teneo began its work for Neom in May 2019, barely eight months after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. In an agreement worth more than $2 million, Teneo agreed to provide the city with messaging, communications, crisis response, and executive coaching. Both the contract and Teneo’s DOJ filings noted that Douglas Band, a former close aide to former U.S. president Bill Clinton and then president and co-founder of Teneo, would be personally involved in the work. (Band left the company in 2020.) Teneo’s early efforts were evidently to the Saudi government’s liking. Teneo agreed to another contract with Neom with an “effective date” of November 1, 2019 — shortly after many media outlets and human rights groups had marked the one-year anniversary of Khashoggi’s assassination at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and only weeks after Turkey’s government revealed transcripts of the journalist’s struggle with the Saudi hit squad sent to intercept him. (The assassins flew to and from Istanbul on planes owned by the PIF.) “You’ll suffocate me” were Khashoggi’s final words before his death. Excerpts from Teneo’s first contract with Neom. Teneo signed the contract in May 2019, barely eight months after Saudi government agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in October 2018. In its federal filings about the $900,000 agreement, Teneo said it would “manage the Neom Communications Department” and “provide leadership of the department as well as staff resources to ensure the foreign principal’s corporate messages and positioning are effectively communicated.” The company’s responsibilities included preparing “a Crisis Preparedness capability for Neom,” according to the contract. Teneo signed two additional contracts with Neom in 2020, bringing in an additional $1.2 million. In August 2021, Teneo’s work for the Saudi government expanded beyond Neom when the firm agreed to work for the PIF. The same month Teneo signed another $3.3 million contract with Neom. Since 2022, Teneo has signed at least nine additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom, the PIF, and another entity created in part by the PIF (and 80 percent owned by it) that, in Teneo’s words, exists “to offer guidance and resourcing to support businesses and industry in the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region as they play their part in the global transition to net zero.” All together, Teneo’s work for the kingdom appears to have been worth more than $30 million so far. “We are also establishing a model for sustainable living around the world,” said Al-Nasr, the Neom CEO, in a press release distributed by Teneo. * * * From Teneo to McCann to Google to Edelman, the web of prestigious and influential Western companies doing business with Neom and the Saudi government is vast and deeply interconnected — and impossible to map in full. This opacity stems from a powerful combination of aggressive nondisclosure agreements, strident corporate obfuscation, and an overwhelming torrent of marketing and PR imagery that blurs the boundary between what is real, and what exists only in digital simulations and science fiction-style YouTube videos. For both the Saudi government and its Western contractors, the distinction between the real and the imaginary appears irrelevant: The image of Neom as a sustainable city of the future is ultimately what matters. What is inescapably real, however, is the amount of money involved, and the growing demand among autocratic oil-producers for help revamping their reputations and selling a green image to domestic audiences and throughout Western capitals. This lucrative ecosystem extends well beyond the borders of Neom: In April, Teneo won a $4.2 million contract with the authoritarian government of Azerbaijan to handle communications for next month’s COP29 UN climate conference. “The whole point of this kind of dictatorship is [to] make believe that everything is so rosy and great,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “And if you’re targeting partners such as the West — companies, global businesses, banks — then you don’t want them to hear about the bad side of the country. You want to maintain that image.” Additional reporting by TJ Jordan Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I find it odd that people don’t question the narrative to Neom, particularly the people who try to point out the impossible aspects of the project, and that it might be a cover for something else like the Glomar Explorer was. I became more suspicious of this when I read a piece, in defense of the project, that stressed the project was possible because it was being built in “modular” form so the parts were not dependent on the whole. So you have different and discrete parts, with work going on underground, that will exist even if nobody ever moves in. If Saudi Arabia were working on it’s own nuclear program, or if they were putting some underground missile silos in place, the more outlandish the proposals the more it works to divert from what is going on – just as Glomar was aided by being linked to the “crazy” or “innovative” Howard Hughes. I don’t know if we have become so trained to fear being labeled a “conspiracy theorist” that we no longer admit governments do things in secret. The public was told about Glomar because of a break-in at some offices – contractors working on their part can be clueless to the whole project and real intent. I have never worried about the CT label, as I remind myself that Class is the main conspiracy. Something worth theorising about and even observing, perhaps judging! Patrick Boyle does a rather good takedown of the sheer nonsense of the projected project, though the gruesome monarchy’s (and its little helpers) activities are no laughing matter. I was just going to link to that! His humour is as dry the Saudi desert. He is slyly rigorous, remaining good natured. Cute as a fox, as my mother used to say. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia though quite rich as a country and able to afford to buy ample growth has had among the poorest growth records of any country these last 45 years. Per capita income has actually declined by more than 40% since 1977: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1x68e August 4, 2014 Real per capita Gross Domestic Product for China, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 1977-2023 (Percent change) https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1x68m August 4, 2014 Real per capita Gross Domestic Product for China, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 1977-2023 (Indexed to 1977) Your email address will not be published.

Title: Big Tech goes nuclear: Amazon's pitch to use power plants shows the crucial role the energy source plays for AI

Happy Friday! Looking for a new way to jumpstart your mornings? (Besides reading this newsletter, of course.) Retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink shared his daily routine that keeps the now-business owner focused. Speaking of new, we've got a cool tool for you to play around with: AI-powered search. We're using generative AI to help easily find all of our great stories. Check it out on our homepage. In today's big story, inside Amazon's internal pitch for turning to nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs. What's on deck: But first, let's power up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. What's bigger than tech's ambitious plans for generative AI? The amount of energy needed to power it. That's led Big Tech to consider nuclear power to address its skyrocketing energy requirements. Business Insider's Eugene Kim has a report on how Amazon navigates its nuclear ambitions. In a signal of how serious Amazon is about going nuclear, the company pitched the energy source to CEO Andy Jassy this June, according to a company document he obtained. Since then, Amazon has led a $500 million financing round for a company developing modular nuclear reactors. It also agreed to purchase power from Talen Energy's nuclear-powered data center in March. And it's not alone. Microsoft and Google have invested in the sector, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman backed a nuclear reactor startup. The stakes are high for tech players to get energy. Eugene previously reported on how Amazon's dreams of building a data center empire face the realities of electricity, water, and labor constraints. Should those data center efforts continue to struggle, companies' big bets on generative AI could also falter. A tech-nuclear relationship is mutually beneficial. Tech companies need cost-efficient, reliable energy sources that won't increase their carbon footprint, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. Nuclear power ticks that box better than other clean energy options like solar or wind. Nuclear power, meanwhile, is an industry in desperate need of some love, BI's Daniel Geiger and Ellen Thomas previously reported. With at least one commercial nuclear plant closing every year since 2013, the sector has welcomed the interest. "We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry," Jim Burke, CEO of nuclear owner Vistra, said back in March. Naturally, there are skeptics. A byproduct of nuclear power is radioactive waste. The transportation and storage of that remains a hot-button issue. High-profile incidents involving power plants like Chernobyl and Fukushima also drew criticism and stoked fears around the globe. Big Tech hasn't shied away from it. In September, Microsoft cut a deal with Constellation Energy to get power from part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, home to the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history.

Title: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing

Microsoft is preparing for a critical shareholder meeting on December 10, during which the future of Bitcoin as a potential investment will be a heated topic. At present, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $68,115, which represents an increase of approximately 1.22%. The rise in interest aligns with constant debates around the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge, which some Microsoft investors find appealing. Microsoft revealed in a recent application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will propose evaluating Bitcoin investment during the forthcoming conference. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) says that Bitcoin has done better than traditional investments and could be a good way to protect against inflation. JUST IN: Per an SEC filing, Microsoft will have a proposed board resolution for an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin”. The board is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST the proposal. pic.twitter.com/0WveygitH9 — TFTC (@TFTC21) October 24, 2024 Microsoft’s board, on the other hand, wants shareholders to vote against this plan because the company has already looked at a wide range of investable assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to a spokesperson for the company: This emphasizes the careful strategy that Microsoft has adopted as far as the management of its corporate treasury is concerned as well as for the benefit of enhancing the shareholders value for the long term. The board is of the opinion that the requested public appraisal is unnecessary, as they already monitor trends and developments in the cryptocurrency sector. Microsoft’s major shareholders include a number of major institutional investors, such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These organizations own a large percentage of the company and have considerable power to affect its policy direction. Although some shareholders are advocating for Bitcoin investments, others may be more in line with the board’s cautious stance. It is important to note that BlackRock has been actively increasing its Bitcoin holdings through its ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has registered inflows to the tune of over $317 million in a 24-hour timeframe, according to recent reports. This trend implies that there is an increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, despite Microsoft’s reluctance to implement comparable measures. As the December conference gets ready, the debate about Bitcoin’s importance in Microsoft’s investment plan gets more intense. The NCPPR argues that businesses should commit at least 1% of their whole assets to Bitcoin to help to reduce inflation risks. Despite this project, Microsoft insists that its present corporate treasury distribution policies are sufficient. Bitcoin has experienced a nearly twofold increase in value in the past year and has recorded a remarkable 414% increase over the past five years. Although Microsoft may not be completely prepared to invest in cryptocurrency investments at this time, the increasing interest from institutional investors such as BlackRock suggests that the discourse surrounding Bitcoin is far from over. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting will be the focus of all attention, and it is uncertain whether the tech giant will alter its position on cryptocurrencies or maintain its commitment to stability in its investment strategy.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.
