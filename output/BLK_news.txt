This restructuring aims to separate U.S. TikTok from its Chinese parent, addressing concerns about data privacy and foreign control. The move came after years of pressure from lawmakers, who feared the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. In 2024, Congress enacted a law, mandating that TikTok’s U.S. operations be separated from ByteDance. ​Under the new structure, about 80% of the U.S. TikTok entity is owned by non-Chinese investors, with ByteDance keeping only a 19.9% share. The newly formed entity, “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” licenses TikTok’s recommendation algorithm from ByteDance and independently manages content moderation, and oversees data protection, algorithm security, and software controls. The managing investor group consists of Oracle, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX. Each holds a 15% stake, totaling 45% of the U.S. business. Here’s what you should know about them. Oracle is a leading cloud computing and database firm that collaborates with top companies, such as OpenAI. Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok and already provides cloud infrastructure for the app, managing its U.S. user data. Under the new deal, Oracle serves as the security partner, auditing TikTok’s compliance with U.S. security requirements, managing data storage, and overseeing updates to the content recommendation algorithm. It’s important to note that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, now the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, is a prominent billionaire with known connections to President Trump. MGX is an AI-focused investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which invests in semiconductors and data centers. The firm was created by Mubadala (Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund) and G42, an Emirati AI company. MGX’s stake in U.S. TikTok could give the firm influence over key decisions shaping TikTok’s AI direction. The firm already backs Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI and contributed to a $100 billion AI data center initiative announced by President Trump, in which Oracle is participating as well. It’s also worth pointing out that MGX has partnerships with Microsoft and BlackRock. Silver Lake, a leading U.S. private equity firm, has long invested heavily in technology companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, Dell Technologies, Tesla, and Waymo. Its role in U.S. TikTok is primarily financial and strategic, offering capital and expertise to help shape the platform’s direction. Notably, Silver Lake has collaborated with MGX in the past, including during the acquisition of a majority stake in the software and chip company Altera last year. Additionally, Silver Lake has invested in G42 since 2021. Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

Title: Whole Foods Customer Shops For Eggs. Then They See Where Store Is Putting Vital Farms Now Amid Controversy: ‘Sprouts Trying To Give Them Away. No One Biting’

Time Published: 2026-01-28T03:00:19Z

Via iStockphoto / @gturek TikTok U.S. consumers are familiar with grocery item phrasing that can be misleading. Many products on the shelf are marketed in ways that don’t always reflect what they actually are. For example, wording such as “natural” or “superfood” isn’t defined or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), giving food manufacturers the liberty to use them as they wish. Still, when a product that has been a staple in customers’ homes for years comes under fire for potentially misrepresenting itself, people are going to be upset. That’s what’s been happening recently with Vital Farms eggs. In a recent TikTok video that has garnered over 434,600 views, creator Gabriel (@gturek) pointed out how Whole Foods is stocking Vital Farms eggs. As he walks towards the egg section, he shows an open-air refrigerator full of Vital Farms eggs in the middle of the floor. Meanwhile, the store placed other brands in other fridges along the perimeter. “Whole Foods got Vital Farms in their own enclosure now smh,” Gabriel wrote in the video’s caption. He added in the caption, “Vital Farms is on timeout.” It all started when Nourish Food Club, a company that sells products like eggs, baked goods, meats, dairy, and cheeses marketed as “cleaner” alternatives, published results from an egg test. According to a YouTube video posted recently, they sent three eggs to be tested for their linoleic acid content. They included one from Nourish Food Club, another from organic Vital Farms, and a third from a cage-free line sold by Meijer. The results, the company claims, showed that Vital Farms contained 3.67 grams of linoleic acid per 100 grams. Nourish Food Club eggs, on the other hand, contained 0.87 grams, and Meijer eggs contained 3.57 grams per 100 grams. Users online quickly started reposting the results, criticizing Vital Farms. The initial controversy seems to have started with a video by creator Zephyr Zoidis, founder of the Localize Food app. As his video and others like it went viral, they brought a significant number of negative comments to the company’s social media accounts, primarily concerning what they feed their chickens. After the backlash, the company shared a TikTok video in which they explained that their hens, while raised in pastures as the packaging claims, are supplemented with corn and soybean meal. UPDATE: In an email correspondence with BroBible, a Vital Farms spokesperson provided material addressing customers’ questions. “We take transparency seriously, and we believe our stakeholders should always know where their food comes from,” they wrote. “When claims suggest we’re misleading the public, we show up with the facts. This week, we’ve seen some misleading headlines and comments about Linoleic Acid in our eggs and what we feed our hens, so we posted content on our social channels and blog to set the record straight.” Vital Farms shared responses to the main questions customers are asking at this link. Under Gabriel’s TikTok video, users expressed frustration at the corporations behind the business. “Dude Amazon OWNS Whole Foods and vital farms,” wrote one user. “Idk why people are surprised. It’s a dirty company who’s only goal is to make money. They know people who want healthy food will spend more, then they gut the company and turn it into a profit farm.” “I loose taste buds when I find out something is owned by blackrock,” wrote another. A correction is needed for these comments, as Amazon does not own Vital Farms, nor does BlackRock. It’s a public company where Amazon holds 3.42% of its shares, and BlackRock 6.60%. “Sprouts trying to give them away,” said a third, sharing a photo of the eggs discounted for $1.99 from $8.99. “No one biting.” “Let’s boycott more bad companies,” another wrote. Linoleic acid is an essential omega-6 fatty acid, and when consumed in moderate amounts, supports human health. When consumed in large amounts, however, some studies have found it may be associated with an increased risk of chronic conditions. These include cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s onset, cancer, dementia, obesity, and diabetes. According to a Harvard Health Publishing report, experts recommend that 5% to 10% of your daily diet should consist of omega-6. If your daily diet consists of 2000 calories, for example, that would be 11 to 22 grams. Currently, though, Americans tend to consume 10 times more omega-6 than omega-3 fats. This is largely due to food manufacturers using oils rich in omega-6, such as sunflower oil and soybean oil. Ultimately, research suggests that the issue has less to do with eggs. Rather, it’s the prevalence of ultra-processed food products or frequent meals outside of the home. To steer away from unhealthy levels of omega-6, nutrition experts recommend keeping the pantry full of fresh, whole foods. #VitalFarms is on timeout ♬ suono originale – Luunaaa BroBible has reached out to Nourish Food Club and Whole Foods via email for comment. We’ve also contacted Gabriel via TikTok messages.

A former Wall Street executive pleaded guilty on Tuesday to luring women to New York so he could drug and sexually assault them, including at his Central Park South apartment. He also pleaded guilty to included receipt of child pornography.Edward Gene Smith, 50, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to four counts, including distributing a controlled substance with the intent to commit rape. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 80 years. Smith, a Harvard graduate, was working as a managing director at Citi until around the time of his initial arrest in July 2024 on child pornography charges, court documents show. Prior to joining Citi in 2021, Smith was a managing director at BlackRock, according to LinkedIn and court records. Smith's attorney did not immediately comment when contacted by Business Insider. "We moved to terminate Mr. Smith immediately upon learning about law enforcement's initial investigation, well before the allegations of this depraved behavior came to light," a Citi spokesperson said. "We will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as they seek justice for the victims of these heinous crimes." A superseding indictment filed in December 2025 said he met a woman they called Victim-1 in 2020 over the internet. He paid her to spend time with him, including traveling to Florida to engage in sexual activity. Every time Kaja publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

The indictment says Smith met a second women over the internet in 2019, when she was a college student, and paid her to relocate to New York City from the Midwest so they could spend more time together. After she moved, he controlled her finances and social life and repeatedly drugged and raped her, the indictment said.

The Government has agreed a package of additional supports for survivors of abuse at institutional schools, including health, education, housing and funeral cost supports. In November, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and then-education minister Helen McEntee met with survivors who were on hunger strike outside Leinster House over a lack of support from the Government. A commitment was given to the group and a mediator has been working through their concerns. The Taoiseach indicated that he would give a formal apology to survivors in the Dáil on behalf of the Government and in consultation with Attorney General Rossa Fanning. Source: PA © RTÉ 2026.

Title: This Is When Elon Musk’s Humanoid Robots Are Expected to Release

Time Published: 2026-01-27T19:36:34Z

By Evolve Editors Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a high-profile appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to share a bold update on the future of labor. During a discussion with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Thursday, January 22, Musk revealed that the company is aiming to make its Optimus humanoid robots available for public sale by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, this timeline marks a significant milestone for the project, which the businessman believes will eventually become the most valuable product in Tesla’s portfolio. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla has already deployed approximately 1,200 Optimus units across its Giga Texas facility to perform basic logistics and assembly tasks. By the end of this year, he expects them to master significantly more complex industrial maneuvers. However, the most striking reveal was the 2027 public release window. Musk explained that once the technology reaches a threshold of “very high reliability and safety,” it will be ready for the general population. He framed the project as a solution to global labor shortages, particularly in elder care and household management. “By the end of next year, I think we’ll be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we’re confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like,” he stated during the panel (via Fox Business). Despite this optimism, the 54-year-old offered a reality check regarding the “agonizingly slow” initial production ramp, which he described as an “S-curve.” Because almost every component in Optimus is entirely new, reaching mass scale remains a massive engineering hurdle. Nevertheless, Elon Musk maintained his vision of a future in which robots outnumber humans, predicting an “explosion in the global economy” that will eventually satisfy all human needs through unprecedented abundance.

Title: Inside the world of Rick Rieder, the $2.3 trillion insomniac who might soon run the Fed

Sometime in the early 1970s, a young Rick Rieder sat in his elementary school cafeteria, not eating. Instead, he stared at his lunch money—a quarter—and weighed the probability of an Oakland Raiders victory. He would obsess over microdata, like how the football team played on turf versus grass, searching for a marginal edge that would turn his 25 cents into fifty. Then, he’d bet. When he lost, he went hungry, he told podcaster and author William Green. That hunger never really went away. He told Green he “gets grumpy during bull markets,” and prefers when the market loses its nerve. Now chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, Rieder has what he admits is a “maniacal” obsession with data that helps him to pick through the wreckage, find the arbitrage, or get out early. “The whole gig,” he said, is managing risk well enough to know when it is time to leave. In the past week, Rieder has surged on prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, overtaking institutional favorites like the “Two Kevins” (Hassett and Warsh) to become a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. His career has been a master class in institutional survival. In July 1987, a 25-year-old Rieder joined former brokerage E.F. Hutton just months before “Black Monday” sent the markets plunging 22% in a single day, forcing the 80-year-old firm into a fire-sale merger with Lehman Brothers. He survived the transition—by his own telling, owing to a “lucky” sudden opening—and spent nearly two decades at Lehman. He departed in May 2008, narrowly before Lehman collapsed into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, to found his own firm, R3 Capital. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink acquired R3 a year later, he installed Rieder at the helm of what would become the largest investment platform in the world, making him a “super investor” managing $2.3 trillion dollars in global bond markets, a sum larger than the annual GDP of most countries in the world. Through the implosions of these two august institutions, Rieder never lost his cool, former colleagues say. Josh Tarnow, a former BlackRock managing director who followed Rieder from Lehman to BlackRock and has watched him “daily in conflict” for three decades, attested to Rieder’s ability to home in when it mattered. “He is very good at accessing his resources, and he is incredibly calm,” Tarnow told Fortune. That temperament is why Tarnow and other longtime colleagues describe Rieder as “made for” what may be the riskiest job in the world: managing the U.S. economy. His momentum on Polymarket has surprised the economic establishment. Rieder hasn’t worked at the Fed before, unlike the other main contenders. Stephen Moore, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, told Fortune the candidacy was a “curveball.” He added that he didn’t know much about the Wall Street candidate. “I should probably be studying up on him,” he said. But those who have watched Rieder since his early days at Lehman are less surprised. Several of his old colleagues told Fortune that the Fed is a natural next challenge for a man who “lives for the markets.”“Especially over the last five years—and maybe over the last 10, 20 years—there’s been an argument in the market that the Fed tends to be late, and that they don’t like looking forward,” a former colleague who worked with Rieder at BlackRock, said. “And so I think Rick will do a great job bridging the gap between a forward-looking approach—everything about his job today is to look forward and project and invest for the future—as opposed to looking backwards.” Green, having interviewed Rieder years ago, said he was surprised that markets underestimated the bond trader for so long. He fits Trump’s model of “central casting”—hiring people who look the part—extraordinarily well, he said.“There’s something about a powerful man, with a lot of money under his control who’s so clearly a winner; I think is very seductive to [the president],” Green said. Rieder’s arc, in retrospect, could look inevitable. It wasn’t. Before he was managing crises for others, he had to work his way out of his own. In high school, Rieder was not just a “mediocre” student, but what he describes as completely “motivationally challenged” and “directionless,” he told podcaster Jon Schultz. While he struggled with liberal arts subjects like history, English literature, and philosophy, which “didn’t sink in,” he did display a specific aptitude: He excelled in typing and accounting, finding the latter logical and “intuitive,” he told Green. Despite this spark, he admits he was a “gym rat” who spent most of his time hanging out and watching movies rather than studying. The “catalyzing event,” as Rieder calls it, occurred while sitting on a rock, on a golf course behind his parents’ house, in Scarsdale, N.Y. After receiving a set of dismal grades during his freshman year at Hobart College, which placed him on “social and academic probation,” Rieder sat on that rock for four hours, terrified by the thought of his father’s reaction. His father was an entrepreneur who ran an office products company called American Unifax. Rieder had watched his father work relentlessly to keep his typewriter ribbon and correction fluid business alive, even as computer technology rendered the products “quickly antiquated” and put the family through tough times, he said. Paralyzed by that contrast with his own trajectory, Rieder realized he had gained weight, was drinking too much beer, and “going nowhere,” he told Green. He credits his roommate for reinforcing the idea that they had to “move on” from their lifestyle of watching movies and hanging out in the gym. He overhauled his life, and the pair transferred from Hobart to Emory University. He found a curriculum that mirrored his internal wiring: business. Once he began taking finance, marketing, and management classes, Rieder said he felt “the ball start rolling downhill”; he transformed from being a near-dropout on probation to an award-winning finance student, ultimately finishing third in his class (though he notes in interviews that his wife, whom he met at Emory, finished first). The ball rolled down the hill, and into the abyss of obsession. Rieder, it seems, does everything at either 100% or at zero. At Wharton, where he earned his MBA, Rieder recalls a visiting executive from the Golden Nugget casino explaining how casinos really make money. Rieder raised his hand and said it was because the odds favored the house. The executive corrected him. Casinos win, he said, because gamblers arrive with $200—and when they lose it, they’re forced to leave. The house, by contrast, has infinite liquidity and time. “And I thought, ‘Gosh, when you oscillate, you hit the down 200, you leave,’” Rieder told Green. “So almost, statistically, you’re always going to hit the down 200 if you stay there long enough. It just emblazoned in my mind the philosophy around the random walk alongside of a trend, and just making sure you’re being thoughtful about optimizing it versus being on the wrong side of it.”That realization, that survival is a matter of staying in the game long enough to let the trend play itself out, transformed Rieder’s life. It wasn’t as simple as adopting a work ethic. He engineered a lifestyle designed to prevent ever hitting his own “down 200” moment, a state of being that his colleagues find both impressive and bewildering. Rieder “doesn’t sleep,” Tarnow said. Or rather, he sleeps a maximum of four hours a night. Colleagues said you can expect emails from him as early as 3 a.m. or as late as 11 p.m. However early they came to the office, Rieder was always earlier, and no matter how late they stayed, Rieder stayed later, they said. “He’s the hardest worker in the room,” two former colleagues said. His house in Florida is covered with massive flat-screen TVs set to markets. He checks Apple’s earnings reports on vacation. And during the Green interview, he even requested permission to execute a trade because he “can’t sit still” while the bond yield curve moves. The effort comes from a distinct passion, his colleagues said, but Rieder has also said it comes from acute anxiety. Rieder told Green that he tracked his biometric data with the Whoop ring, and found that his stress levels peaked at 11:30 p.m., the moment he was forced to disconnect and sleep despite Asian markets being open. They plummet at 3:45 a.m., the moment he finally gets to wake up and grab his phone. “I hate the feeling of not being in control while sleeping,” he told Green. He only relaxes once he can see the markets moving. Trading fixed income is a distinctly different game than trading stocks. In the stock market, traders typically hunt for the upside, trying to find the next big thing that they can ride to the moon. Bond traders like Rieder, by contrast, are constantly staring down the cliff of what could go wrong. For Rieder, managing $2.7 trillion in fixed income means overseeing a massive sea of debt that is constantly under threat from inflation, rising interest rates, and other geopolitical “exogenous” events. There are pressures and risks you cannot prepare for, but you just have to learn how to “make a little bit of money a lot of times,” one of his former colleagues said. The way to win out over decades—often beating benchmark indexes—is just to ensure that you are always hedged enough, and have enough liquidity, to never hit the statistical “down 200” that forces you to leave. How do you measure success in that kind of game? Rieder has said he doesn’t feel successful. “I still feel like I’m going to get fired every day,” he told Green. To the average person, Rieder’s work style sounds crazy. But to fellow finance people, it’s magnetic. Since Lehman, Rieder has accumulated a distinct group of 42 people who followed him from Lehman to R3 to BlackRock, endlessly loyal to their boss, because they knew when push came to shove, they’d never lose because they didn’t try hard enough, his former colleagues said.“Rick was able to find a good balance between being supercompetitive and very demanding, while also trying to take great care of the people that were working alongside of him,” a colleague who worked with him at Lehman and BlackRock said. He understands if people don’t share his same lifestyle aspirations, and during particularly tough weekends, he was known to buy new tech gadgets to share with the team like the Meta sunglasses where you could listen to music while playing sports, a former colleague said. Another colleague noted that after a rough year early on in his career, Rieder bought him a “brightly colored tie” as a fun gift. He also, Tarnow said, took time to help his people when the company was transitioning; finding the right opportunities here and there for others.“This is a guy that’s always worried about people more than himself,” Tarnow said. Ultimately, the constant assessment of what could go wrong has made Rieder a distinctly humble figure in an industry often defined by ego. Every colleague and partner interviewed by Fortune used the word “humility” to describe him. In high-stakes environments, like meetings with powerful CEOs or angry clients, Rieder is known as a listener rather than a talker. “He holds the room because he is a very good listener; he entertains different opinions,” Tarnow said. “He’s a seeker of truth. This is a guy that is doing the best he can to get to the truth.”But even in lower-stakes environments, he has the same attitude. He takes on multiple charitable endeavors. Paul Bambrick-Santoyo, who leads Uncommon Schools, the Newark charter school system that Rieder has invested in and where he’s served on the board for 20 years, noted that most people at the school would never recognize how influential he is in the global economy because of how quietly he carries himself. “There’s a kindness and a gentleness to him that we get to see every day in the work he does with us,” he told Fortune. “He has an incredible sense of service and never takes credit for anything.” Shawn Shivalkar, who cofounded a popular alternative investment club at Emory University under Rieder’s guidance, recalls a similarly disarming presence during their first meeting at BlackRock. Sitting in an office filled with messy papers and massive screens displaying markets moving, Shivalkar found a man who was “super engaged” but completely unpretentious. “He just had all his screens up, and he was just asking us questions,” Shivalkar told Fortune. “And he was bouncing a basketball up over his head, just kind of tossing it up in the air and catching it. It wasn’t like a, ‘All right, I’m here to trick you with a bunch of twisty questions’ kind of meeting. It was a very productive and respectful dialogue.” What does this all mean in terms of his fitness to serve as Fed chair? Well, for his colleagues, it seems obvious that he is the best fit for the role: “No one’s going to care more or have more passion for doing the job,” one former colleague said. No one will outwork him, or have more of a will to the truth. But that assumes, of course, that Rieder can stay motivated without the constant, short-term pressure of the markets. One of his former colleagues was surprised that Rieder would want the role, given how staid the position is and how he would have to survive the browbeating of politics for credibility instead of operating on his own logic. Can a man biologically hardwired to be anxious when markets close, whose mantra, according to his old colleagues, was, “It’s not about being right, it’s about making money,” ultimately ignore markets when needing to make a tough interest rate call and pretend not to care how much money is on the line with his decision? The question matters especially now, as the White House has grown increasingly sensitive to market reactions and Trump has repeatedly criticized and threatened Fed Chair Powell for keeping interest rates high even as investors pushed for relief. Rieder’s own politics are slightly elusive. He donated to and supported Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), but he has also donated half a million to Republican PACs to support Trump’s presidency. His former colleagues say they’d be shocked if Rieder threw away his role to become a simple loyalist. Tarnow said the job would ultimately “free” Rieder. “I think it’d be freeing for him, that his responsibility isn’t to make money,” Tarnow said. The data-obsessed Rieder could consider variables he hadn’t been able to before, when he was just focused on his fiduciary responsibility: “His responsibility set is to guide the country fiscally to a point where we’re at our best.” His mantra, according to former colleagues, is also, “Work hard, play hard, give back.” Rieder told Green he has signs that say that all over his house. Now, Tarnow says, he might get the ultimate opportunity to give back. “This is a guy that wants this,” Tarnow said.

Title: Coinbase Forms Quantum Computing Advisory Board as Bitcoin Security Concerns Grow

Coinbase has launched an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain to proactively safeguard Bitcoin and other digital assets against potential future quantum threats. Earlier this week, Coinbase announced the creation of an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain, aiming to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against emerging quantum threats. The board will bring together leading experts in quantum computing, cryptography, and blockchain to assess risks and provide guidance to the broader industry. Quantum computers, if scaled successfully, could compromise the cryptography that underpins major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase, in their announcement, stressed that preparing for these future challenges is crucial to maintaining the security of digital assets. The advisory board includes notable figures such as quantum computing pioneer Scott Aaronson, Stanford cryptography expert Dan Boneh, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, and Coinbase’s own Head of Cryptography, Yehuda Lindell. The group says they will publish position papers, recommend best practices for long-term security, and respond to significant advances in quantum computing. This initiative is part of Coinbase’s larger post-quantum security strategy, which also includes updating Bitcoin address handling, enhancing internal key management, and advancing research on post-quantum signature schemes. The board’s first position paper is expected early next year, laying out a roadmap for quantum resilience in blockchain systems. Coinbase said the move underscores the importance of proactive planning, ensuring the crypto industry remains prepared, not reactive, as quantum technology evolves. Over the last several months, concerns over quantum computing’s potential impact on Bitcoin have begun to ripple through traditional finance, prompting some investors to radically rethink their exposure to the cryptocurrency. Jefferies strategist Christopher Wood recently removed Bitcoin from his Greed & Fear model portfolio, citing the existential risk that large-scale quantum computers could undermine the cryptographic foundations securing digital assets. While the threat is not imminent, Wood and other institutional voices — including BlackRock and UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti — warn that quantum advances could eventually allow attackers to derive private keys from public ones, putting millions of BTC at risk. As a result, Wood replaced Bitcoin with gold and gold-mining equities, emphasizing that long-term store-of-value claims for digital assets may be less reliable in the face of accelerating technological change. The debate over quantum computing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is intensifying. Coinbase research indicates that roughly 20% to 50% of Bitcoin’s supply, particularly coins in older wallet formats, could be vulnerable to so-called long-range quantum attacks. Crypto developers and researchers are divided over the urgency of implementing quantum-resistant solutions, with some advocating proactive upgrades and others arguing the risk remains distant. Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor believes that quantum computing will actually strengthen Bitcoin rather than threaten it. Network upgrades and coin migrations will boost security, while lost coins remain frozen, Saylor posted.

Title: Here's what to expect at the Fed's first interest rate meeting of 2026

Watch CBS News Updated on: January 27, 2026 / 11:57 AM EST / CBS News President Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but central bank officials are unlikely to deliver a first cut of 2026 when they announce their next policy move on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to keep the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for short-term loans — in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The pause would come after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings late last year. The meeting also comes amid weeks of turmoil involving the Fed. The Department of Justice earlier this month opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell related to the central bank's renovation of its historic buildings, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence. The Supreme Court is also currently weighing whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to fire her. Mr. Trump, who has assailed Powell for failing to deliver deeper rate cuts, is also soon expected to name a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires in May. Against that backdrop, the Fed will make its rate decision while weighing two potentially troubling economic trends: A weakening labor market and an inflation rate that remains well above the central bank's annual target of 2%. "It's appropriate that they take a little bit of a beat to digest the information and try to set the stage for 2026," Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News. "It probably would have been a sleepy meeting if it weren't for the Supreme Court hearing about Lisa Cook, the [Justice Department] investigation into the renovation and the search for the replacement for the Fed chair." On Wednesday, Powell will have to pivot from the political drama around his tenure at the Fed to explaining the economic rationale behind the central bank's latest monetary calculus. The Fed chief has repeatedly stated that the Fed's policy moves are determined by data, not by political pressure from the White House. The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 28, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The press conference, which typically lasts for 45 minutes, provides the Fed chair with an opportunity to discuss the thinking behind the interest-rate decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting committee. The Fed's rate decisions ripple through the economy because they influence what banks charge for loans, ranging from credit card APRs to auto loans. That can have a major impact on how much consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. If the Fed keeps rates steady, as economists expect, consumers may not feel much of an impact. A single 0.25 percentage-point rate cut, the Fed's typical reduction, doesn't do much to alter borrowing costs, Bankrate's Kates said. Even so, the Trump administration is seeking to convince voters that it is tackling affordability, an issue for many Americans who are feeling strained after several years of above-average inflation. As part of that effort, Mr. Trump has announced plans to cap credit card rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, among other steps the administration says are aimed at lowering costs. Meanwhile, borrowing costs have already eased for many types of products following last year's multiple rate cuts, noted LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz. "Rates on several types of loans are at their lowest levels in years and should keep drifting down for a little while longer," Schulz said in an email. "That's a relief at a time when affordability is still a real struggle for many families." Mr. Trump could announce his nominee to replace Powell as early as this week, according to SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy. Among the top candidates for the role are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of financial services firm BlackRock, has also more recently emerged as a leading contender, according to the betting markets, Duy noted. "It's a little surprising to see Rick Rieder coming out as a frontrunner — he's someone who was not really talked about four weeks ago," Kates said. "He doesn't come from the traditional feeder program for the Fed chair — it would be a little bit of an out-of-left-field choice, but that's something this administration has tried to make a habit of." Appointing a new Fed chair who is amenable to Mr. Trump's wish for lower interest rates may not be enough to move the needle. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed chair is only one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady. Powell is likely to stress the importance of the Fed's independence at Wednesday's meeting, experts said. "We expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence," said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas in a report. "This news conference, following a tumultuous two weeks, will be the next step in defining Powell's legacy. Edited by Alain Sherter In: © 2026 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Rick Rieder, a rising favorite for Trump's Fed chair pick, sees bitcoin as new gold

As the race for the next Federal Reserve Chair heats up, BlackRock's Rick Rieder has suddenly emerged as the new frontrunner on prediction markets to lead the central bank. And if President Trump does tap Rieder for the role, it could be a huge moment for the crypto industry, as BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income isn't just a "crypto curious" but an outspoken advocate for the digital assets. In fact, he might be a bitcoin bull. He said as far back as 2020 — in much earlier days of digital assets — that bitcoin would take over for gold as a store of value, "because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around," he told CNBC in an interview. And more recently, he told the same outlet that bitcoin should be part of a smart investment mix, saying that the leading digital token and gold were "things that give you a little bit of ballast in the portfolio." In that September interview, when bitcoin was still above $112,000, he predicted "it's going to go up." The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $88,000, having recently fallen amid potential tariff threats and other geopolitical turmoil. Trump has a choice to make before the term of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — who the president has framed as his economic nemesis — is set to expire on May 15. It was Trump who originally placed Powell, a Republican, in that pivotal role, but the president has since routinely lamented his performance, calling him "dumb" and "stupid" and nicknames such as "Mr. Too Late." Meanwhile, Trump has often teased about frontrunners for his replacement, making for a volatile prediction market. Rieder has said it's "an unbelievable honor to even be mentioned in that list." Rieder vocally shares Trump's frustrations at the sedate pace at which the Fed has cut interest rates. In a recent interview during the president's trip to Davos in Switzerland, Trump called Rieder "very impressive," and his odds on Polymarket climbed from under 3% to almost 53% at their peak, before settling currently at around 48%. For the crypto sector, a Fed chair can pull multiple levers. Apart from a heavy influence on the group that sets the federal funds rate, the chair controls the board's regulatory agenda. However, Powell has deferred to the vice chair for supervision, Michelle Bowman, on the Fed's supervisory work. So Rieder's crypto enthusiasm may not have a significant role in the rules the regulatory side of the Fed writes for things like stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). More than as a mechanic of policy, a Fed chair has a softer role as an outsized voice on the health and direction of the U.S. economy, and a staunch bitcoin advocate in that position would be a first. Though Powell is departing soon as chairman, his term as a regular governor on the Fed board continues, leaving some question about whether he'll take the traditional route and exit after his term as chairman expires or stay on for another two years. Every member of the board has an automatic seat on the Federal Open Market Committee, which decides U.S. interest rates, meaning a Powell decision to stay would keep his generally centrist position in place in that group and would fail to open another seat for a Trump appointee. Trump's relentless criticism of Powell escalated last month when his Department of Justice said it's investigating the central bank chairman for his public descriptions of renovations at the Federal Reserve buildings in Washington. Powell released an unusual, direct response. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president," Powell said.

Today’s top news: A sobering note from inside the AI frontier model race. And what does it mean for crypto? 📌 What Happened Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei published an essay warning that AI capabilities are advancing faster than the systems meant to control, govern, and align them. This creates a growing risk gap as models become more autonomous and powerful. Dario’s core thesis is about speed and compounding. Each generation of AI models builds on the last, accelerating progress in a way that compresses timelines and reduces room for error. Meanwhile, safety research, governance frameworks, and institutional responses move linearly, not exponentially. He argues that society is entering a phase where capability gains are no longer matched by proportional improvements in control, especially as models begin to reason, plan, and act with less direct human oversight. Specifically, he expects AGI to come in the next 1-2 years, and shared concerns like 50% of the entry white collar workforce no longer needed within 1-5 years. 🗣️ What They’re Saying Dario framed the challenge starkly: “AI progress is now moving faster than our ability to ensure that it remains aligned with human values and under meaningful human control.” He warned that relying on informal norms or reactive fixes is unlikely to work at scale: “We should not assume that we’ll be able to simply patch problems after deployment once systems become sufficiently autonomous.” And he emphasized that the window for proactive action is shrinking: “The time to build strong safety, governance, and control mechanisms is before systems become overwhelmingly powerful, not after.” 🧠 Why It Matters Dario’s warning lands at an important moment for markets. The AI trade is already one of the dominant macro narratives, pulling in capital, reshaping equity indices, and driving massive investment into compute, data centers, and infrastructure. At the same time, the macro backdrop is shifting. Rates are no longer collapsing, geopolitics are back in focus, and metals are soaring. What about crypto? Well, not much rotation so far in 2026. The good news is—it’s doubtful that the “AI bubble” is going to pop. If anything, the opposite. But that comes with its own set of challenges, and a future 3-years out where half of the white-collar workforce is unemployed is both hard to imagine and hard to model out. Stacking hard assets in preparation for that potential future is likely a good strategy. And Bitcoin remains at the top of the shortlist for many, especially as the metals trade looks like it’s in a blow-off top. Is the rotation coming?

Title: What Davos Revealed About BlackRock, Ripple And XRP: Pundits Weigh In
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/what-davos-revealed-blackrock-ripple-xrp-pundits/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T14:30:40Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A panel of XRP-focused commentators is leaning heavily into Davos optics as evidence that BlackRock and Ripple are converging on a shared vision for tokenized finance, even as none of the participants produced direct confirmation of a formal partnership between the two firms. Host Versan Aljarrah opened by pointing to “BlackRock and Brad Garlinghouse at Davos,” asking guest Jake Claver what he took from their presence and the “conclusion they had over there.” Claver’s answer centered on what he said he heard from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about settlement consolidation. “He mentioned that it would be ideal if everything was on one blockchain or at least settled back to one blockchain,” Claver said. “For Ripple to be in the room and having been in the room for years at this point, it gives me you know a lot of confidence that it is the XRPL […] I feel like BlackRock and Ripple are much more involved than people realize.” Today we’re joined by @beyond_broke to discuss BlackRock’s quiet ties with Ripple, the soft disclosures around XRP, and the future of digitization and tokenization. Excited to have everyone back together for this one.https://t.co/oMHGWqMehB pic.twitter.com/u1s7LyOAhs — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 26, 2026 Aljarrah immediately widened the claim beyond Davos stagecraft, asserting, “it’s quite obvious at this point that Blackrock, JP Morgan, Ripple and all these major banks they have some ties to Ripple [and] XRP,” before returning to the recurring theme that Davos access itself is a filter. Later, he argued that the set of crypto-native executives allowed near institutions like the WEF and BIS was narrowing and that Garlinghouse’s inclusion mattered more than “headline hype.” David (Digital Outlook) pushed the discussion toward implementation, but repeatedly brought BlackRock back into the frame as a connective thread in Ripple’s institutional strategy. “When it came out to like, okay, has Ripple really positioned themselves to be like […] the main leader in the space […] with the acquisitions that they’ve made […] custody with Palisade,” he said. “I think they got Metaco and Standard Custody in there […] clearance through Hidden Road, all that. Then […] you see all these other linkages between their partners like what they’re doing with Blackrock. You know, they’ve got some stuff going on there.” A second line of argument was that BlackRock’s eventual entry could be the trigger for an XRP liquidity event. Edo Farina framed it in “order size” terms: “It takes one huge institutional order from a Blackrock a great scale and that’s it,” he said, claiming market pricing can stay muted if institutional positioning happens through OTC arrangements. Claver added: “When Blackrock steps in, there will be likely a supply shock that allows XRP to decouple from the rest of the crypto market and Bitcoin,” and tied that idea to a viral episode the panel said briefly moved XRP out of sync with the rest of crypto. “We’ve seen it decoupled once […] when […] the [fake] trust that had been filed in Delaware for Blackrock’s iShares XRP ETF […] hit Twitter,” Claver said. Still, BlackRock’s observable crypto footprint still tilts towards Ethereum and Bitcoin rather than XRP. BlackRock’s flagship US spot exposure is via products tracking bitcoin and ether, IBIT and ETHA, while its tokenization beachhead has also been Ethereum-first: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, and only later expanded to additional networks. Also, BlackRock’s own 2026 thematic outlook is explicitly naming Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that “collects the toll” as tokenization scales, with stablecoins treated as an early proxy for tokenization “in action.” BlackRock highlights data indicating “65%+” of tokenized assets sit on Ethereum, an argument for why “one blockchain” speculation often defaults to ETH in institutional circles. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: XRG to increase stake in NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project

XRG has announced plans to increase its stake in NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal facility at the Port of Brownsville in Texas, US. The energy investment company, owned by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), will acquire an additional 7.6% equity interest in Trains 4 and 5 at the project from Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a subsidiary of BlackRock. This move is part of XRG’s strategy to bolster its position in the global LNG market. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more The acquisition follows XRG’s earlier investment in phase one of the project, where it purchased an indirect 11.7% stake in Trains 1–3 through the same partner. As part of this previous transaction, ADNOC Trading secured a 20-year LNG offtake agreement for 1.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from Train 4. Trains 4 and 5 are each expected to produce approximately 6mtpa of LNG, with long-term agreements already in place with high-credit-quality offtakers. The Rio Grande LNG facility is expected to play a significant role in the US economy by generating more than 5,000 construction jobs and approximately 700 long-term positions in the Rio Grande Valley. Financial specifics of the current transaction remain undisclosed, and it is contingent upon customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. XRG international gas business president Mohamed Al Aryani said: “Expanding our investment in Rio Grande LNG reinforces XRG’s commitment to delivering on our global gas strategy and advancing the vital role LNG plays in providing reliable and flexible energy supply to international markets. “The project continues to progress well, with strong construction momentum marking steady steps toward bringing new LNG capacity online. “By growing our presence in US LNG, we are strengthening a resilient, globally scaled gas platform while further deepening the UAE [United Arab Emirates]–US energy partnership – supporting energy security, jobs and investment‑driven growth.” In September 2025, NextDecade made a positive final investment decision on Train 4, fully funding it along with its related infrastructure and issuing a full notice to proceed to Bechtel Energy. Train 4 is supported by long-term sales agreements with ADNOC, TotalEnergies and Aramco. Completion and first delivery are anticipated by late 2030. Similarly, in October 2025, NextDecade approved Train 5’s development and funding. Train 5 is backed by agreements with JERA, EQT and ConocoPhillips, and is expected to be operational by early 2031. Both trains have estimated project costs of $6.7bn each, covering engineering, procurement and construction costs, owner expenses, contingencies, financing fees, construction interest and other related outlays. With a total potential liquefaction capacity of around 48mtpa currently under construction at Rio Grande LNG and space for up to ten trains on-site, NextDecade aims to become one of the largest LNG export companies globally.

Title: Strategy buys $264m Bitcoin during price dip as investors brace for 80% government shutdown chance

About us Copy link The threat of a US government shutdown isn’t scaring Michael Saylor. Strategy purchased another $264 million in Bitcoin, the firm announced Monday. The digital asset treasury led by Saylor now holds about $63 billion worth of the top crypto, at an average purchase price of $76,037 per Bitcoin. Strategy’s latest haul comes as investors brace for a likely US federal government shutdown. Democrats threaten their Republican peers with a national gridlock in response to multiple deadly shootings in Minneapolis by federal agents. Following nationwide protests and international condemnation, Senate Democrats have vowed to block a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Prediction market Polymarket now shows an 80% chance for a federal shutdown, which is bad news for asset markets like crypto and stocks. The record 43-day government shutdown in October and November severely damaged investor sentiment as key US agencies responsible for data and oversight were left “flying blind,” the White House said. Bitcoin and other cryptos are still down over $1 trillion since peaking in October. The looming shutdown also lands as President Donald Trump’s abrasive strategies that target key American allies and trade partners have driven investors to dump exposure to the US. The greenback is down about 15% against the euro over the past year. Meanwhile, safe-haven asset gold has enjoyed a meteoric rise, breaching $5,100 per ounce on Monday. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold” by Saylor, isn’t enjoying the same shine. To be sure, the uncertainty is not stopping Wall Street from pushing deeper into the digital assets industry. On Monday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed to launch a second Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund that would give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency — along with a little yield. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has seen massive success since its launch in 2024. It is the largest crypto-focused ETF, holding Bitcoin worth nearly $70 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Strategy shareholders are encouraged to tune into the firm’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call on 5 February. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. More than three decades ago, the legendary Warren Buffett returned a call to a fact-checker, explaining what he meant when he used the term “elephant-bumping affairs." Buffett was gently deriding talkathons such as the World Economic Forum (WEF) and CEO summits hosted by business magazines. I was then working for Fortune magazine in New York and was the fact-checker Buffett called. I couldn’t help smiling as he remarked that these summits were where large egos went to bump into others of their tribe. That early lesson from a man who was a role model of self-deprecating humility for me made me sceptical of Davos, where the WEF holds its annual huddle. This was only heightened when I attended the WEF’s satellite summits in India and China. These reinforced what Buffett said, but with a corollary: Such events make it possible for busy people to take a brief holiday while seeming busy. But, this year’s WEF was different. There was plenty of news, ranging from US President Donald Trump’s disavowal of the use of force to take over Greenland to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s overpraised speech calling out US hegemony. There has been a change, of course, in leadership at the WEF itself with the resignation last April of founder Klaus Schwab after whistleblowers reportedly accused him of research manipulation and financial impropriety. Schwab and his wife were cleared of the charges, but Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and WEF co-chair, now seems in control. Fink mused about moving it from Davos to Dublin or Detroit. Surely Delhi, at least in the interest of alliteration, deserves to be on that list, but he only mentioned Jakarta in Asia. At the centre of this circus, inevitably, was Trump. He walked back his threat to invade Greenland and impose higher tariffs on Nato allies opposed to that idea. Davos and its aftermath are all about predictions, so let me make one. January 2026 will be remembered as the point when Trump’s authority started to unravel. The term TACO (‘Trump Always Chickens Out’) has never seemed more apt. He tends to change tack when the US stock market tumbles, which appeared to be the proximate cause for his rollback of outlandish tariffs announced on Liberation Day in April as well as his decision to sound more conciliatory on Greenland. Machiavelli’s much quoted line that a ruler is better feared than loved might have to be reworked for the Age of Trump. Like the MGM lion that roars at the start of a film from this studio, Trump often comes across like a parody US president, adapted for the small screens of smartphones. While the hypocrisy of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was at least once dressed up with highfalutin talk about installing democracy, US attacks on Nigeria and Venezuela in January came without much attempt at justification. Subsequent meetings in the White House with oil majors to coax them to invest in Venezuela only underlined that this was a resource grab. The chief of Exxon, however, termed the country “uninvestable." January does not just mark the first anniversary of the most tumultuous US presidency ever, but also a rise in TACO readings, with many arguing that the words of a leader who made his name as a TV show host are mostly bluster. Overshadowed at Davos by Trump and Carney was Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. He referred to US-China trade talks as a prime example of cooperation and called for fair treatment of Chinese companies overseas. This is rhetoric more muted than the bluster from the US, but even more potent. Ahead of lecturing Davos about middle powers needing to stand up to the US hegemon, Canada’s Carney had reached an agreement with Beijing that involves slashing tariffs for the first 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) sold in Canada from 100% to 6%. This week, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is slated to visit Beijing to put UK-China relations on a different path. Perhaps major middle powers such as Canada, the UK and even India should read closely the details of China’s current five-year plan; Beijing seeks to dominate the commanding heights of green technology such as batteries and EVs, while ceding little space to developing countries to build market share in low-end electronics, toys and garments. China’s share of global container shipments reached 37% for the first three quarters of last year, while its trade surplus for the full year hit $1.2 trillion. Its response to US tariffs has been to decimate manufacturing in developing countries. The head of an industry body in Jakarta estimated that the textile sector alone in Indonesia had lost 300,000 jobs to cheap Chinese imports. The trouble is that Trump’s mostly successful attempt to control the news cycle pushes China’s hegemonic behaviour to the sidelines. Robin Harding, Asia editor of the Financial Times, spent time in Beijing in November asking economists and business leaders what the world could sell China. The answers were mostly patronising. Soyabeans and iron ore, said one. Higher education said another, but only because Peking University and Tsinghua are hard to get admission to. Unable to think of much else, they suggested that Europe allow Chinese companies to set up more factories there. This attitude of ‘What’s mine is mine and what’s yours will be mine’ should be condemned, but don’t expect to hear that at Davos. The author is a former Financial Times foreign correspondent.

Title: Bitcoin is now cheaper on Coinbase compared to Binance, and the culprit may not be “weak US demand”
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/?p=516588
Time Published: 2026-01-27T10:49:11Z
Full Content:
The index compares BTC/USD vs BTC/USDT, so USDT parity, funding, and offshore leverage can mechanically deepen discounts. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Coinbase's Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below competing exchanges this week, and the gap continues to widen. CoinGlass reported on Jan. 26 that its Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which tracks the price difference between Coinbase's BTC/USD and Binance's BTC/USDT, turned sharply negative, indicating Bitcoin trades at a discount on the largest US venue compared to offshore competitors. The move arrives as US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.1 billion in outflows last week and broader risk appetite weakened, raising questions about whether American institutional demand is cracking or whether something messier is happening in crypto market plumbing. The answer is likely both, and the distinction matters because a persistent discount reveals more than sentiment, exposing constraints in how liquidity moves between venues, how ETF flows translate to spot execution, and whether arbitrage infrastructure can keep markets connected during stress. CoinGlass documents its premium index as the price difference between Coinbase Pro and Binance, with a negative reading meaning Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. The index is not purely a demand gauge, as it measures the spread between a USD-denominated venue and a USDT-denominated venue, which introduces mechanical effects from stablecoin deviations, funding conditions, and offshore leverage dynamics. The baseline interpretation treats widening negative premiums as evidence of relatively stronger sell pressure or weaker bid depth on US-linked venues compared to offshore markets. However, cross-exchange price deviations can persist for days or weeks even in liquid markets, reflecting genuine segmentation rather than pure supply-demand shifts. Research on crypto price formation documents large recurring gaps driven by transfer frictions, compliance barriers, credit limits, and inventory constraints that prevent arbitrage from closing dislocations instantly. The question is not whether selling exists, as it always does, but why cross-venue arbitrage failed to compress the gap and what that reveals about stress in financing, settlement infrastructure, or risk appetite. When US spot Bitcoin ETFs record net outflows, authorized participants and market makers adjust hedges and liquidity provision, which can translate into net spot selling or reduced bid depth. Coinbase serves as a primary liquidity venue for US institutional crypto infrastructure, handling custody for over 80% of Bitcoin ETF issuers, and BlackRock materials reference Coinbase Prime as an affiliate of the iShares Bitcoin Trust custodian. That embedded role means ETF redemption activity can route through Coinbase-linked execution pathways more directly than through offshore venues. Farside Investors data shows multiple days of sizable outflows from US-traded Bitcoin ETFs over the past week, totaling over $1.3 billion. The timing correlation is suggestive but not definitive, as most US spot Bitcoin ETFs use cash creations and redemptions rather than pure in-kind transfers, which introduces latency between ETF share flow and spot execution. The pattern resembles a symptom of balance sheet tightening. When ETF flows wobble and macro risk appetite weakens, US-linked liquidity providers pull bids faster than offshore leverage unwinds, creating transient but persistent discounts. The premium becomes a real-time gauge of whether institutional appetite is keeping pace with supply. And, right now, it suggests US bids are stepping back. The index structure introduces a second mechanical driver: because Coinbase trades against USD and Binance against USDT, any deviation in the USDT/USD rate affects the calculated premium even if spot demand is identical across venues. Kaiko has documented episodes in which USDT rapidly flips between discount and premium during market stress, driven by stablecoin supply constraints, offshore funding conditions, or perp market basis dynamics. If USDT trades above parity, then BTC/USDT prices appear optically higher, mechanically worsening Coinbase's discount even if no additional selling occurs on Coinbase itself. Perpetual swap markets compound this effect. Funding rates are mechanically linked to spot-perp basis calculations. When funding turns negative or compresses, the relationship between USD and USDT venues can dislocate as traders adjust hedges venue-by-venue based on margin requirements and collateral preferences. This channel doesn't invalidate the demand interpretation, complicating it instead. A widening discount can simultaneously reflect US spot selling pressure and offshore stablecoin microstructure stress. When the CME Bitcoin futures basis compresses, and perpetual swap funding turns negative or flat, spot becomes the fastest hedge leg for traders unwinding positions. CF Benchmarks notes that the CME basis is strongly tied to sentiment shifts and momentum regimes, and that basis compression often coincides with risk-off moves. If basis and premium both deteriorate simultaneously, that alignment points to a broader de-risk environment rather than an isolated US weakness. In frictionless markets, a Coinbase discount should attract buy-on-Coinbase, sell-offshore arbitrage until the gap closes. Persistent widening implies something is constraining that flow: balance sheet limits, compliance frictions, transfer costs, volatility risk, or simply that arbitrage capital is deployed elsewhere. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. Academic work on crypto arbitrage documents large recurring deviations and meaningful market segmentation, with price gaps persisting longer during sell-offs when liquidity deteriorates, and risk limits tighten. Kaiko research discusses fragmentation-driven dislocations that flare during stress periods, noting order book depth can thin asymmetrically across venues. If Coinbase's bid depth shrinks relative to Binance's, discounts persist even if arbitrageurs recognize the opportunity, because executing large size becomes prohibitively expensive or risky. The most actionable signal is not that selling exists but that market connectivity is degrading. When institutional flow turns negative, financing signals deteriorate, and arbitrage can't close gaps, the combination indicates genuine stress rather than routine volatility. The first foreseeable scenario is a reversion, in which ETF flows stabilize or turn positive, risk appetite recovers, and the premium mean-reverts to zero. This path depends on macro stabilization and renewed institutional appetite, which aggregators' data can confirm day to day. If outflows stop and inflows resume, arbitrage capital returns, and discounts naturally compress. The second scenario involves persistence, with the premium remaining negative as ETFs continue bleeding and macro conditions remain risk-off. Rallies become fragile because the US bid depth never fully recovers, creating resistance at higher price levels. This regime favors patient sellers over momentum buyers and keeps volatility elevated. Microstructure shock scenario: USDT/USD dislocates sharply, funding regimes shift abruptly, or a venue-specific event introduces new frictions. The premium becomes noisy and less interpretable as a pure demand signal, with larger intraday swings driven by offshore stablecoin dynamics rather than spot flows. Coinbase's widening discount functions as a symptom dashboard rather than a single diagnosis. It reflects US-linked net selling and weak bids when ETF flows are negative, but it also reflects USD-versus-USDT plumbing stress and constrained arbitrage capacity. All three dynamics intensify during risk-off regimes, making the premium a composite signal of institutional appetite, stablecoin microstructure health, and market connectivity. The forward-looking question is whether arbitrage infrastructure can keep pace with institutional flow shifts. If ETFs continue bleeding while arbitrage remains constrained and financing conditions tighten, the discount becomes a leading indicator of liquidity fragmentation rather than a lagging indicator of sentiment. The difference matters because fragmentation persists longer and resolves less predictably than simple supply-demand imbalances. For now, the widening gap suggests US balance sheets are tightening faster than offshore leverage is unwinding, and that market plumbing is struggling to keep prices in sync. That combination doesn't guarantee further downside, but it does indicate the infrastructure needed to absorb selling pressure or sustain rallies is operating under stress. And stress, once embedded in market microstructure, tends to linger even after headlines improve. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Forget the Bitcoin price, several specific stress signals are the only thing standing between stability and chaos. While Bitcoin still wears the long-term crown, the "grandpa metal" has quietly generated 84% more wealth over the last five years. As shutdown risk elevates, Bitcoin traders brace for ETF outflows and potential data blackouts. ZachXBT's theft allegations cast doubt on US government's ability to securely manage vast Bitcoin holdings. For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, price appreciation is no longer reliably associated with rising on-chain adoption. His first official WEF slot since Binance’s 2023 settlement and his 2025 pardon wasn’t forgiveness. It was institutional necessity.

Title: What to expect from January's Fed meeting as Powell faces looming DOJ probe

It's the first Fed day of 2026, and Chair Jerome Powell is in the hot seat. The central bank announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, as was widely expected. The meeting follows weeks of political pressure from the Trump administration and a recently announced Department of Justice probe. Business Insider will be covering projections from economists, the Fed decision, and market moves all day. Check back here for updates. With the first Fed meeting of the new year in the books, here's what caught our attention: Read full story The FOMC will meet again on March 17 and 18 to determine the next interest rate move and share economic projections, including where members expect interest rates to fall by the end of the year. Powell has two more meetings left in his term as chair. Powell had one big piece of advice for his successor: "Stay out of elected politics. Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it." He added that "It's a regular, affirmative obligation for us to go to Congress and talk to people. If you want democratic legitimacy, you earn it in interactions with our elected overseers. You need to work hard at it. And I have worked hard at it." Powell reflected AI's impact on the job market — and it could be good news for workers. "Every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs. It's always been the case. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption. But ultimately, technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. It may not all happen immediately, but over time, it's what enables incomes to rise," Powell said. Powell did not answer a question on the Fed chair race and whether he plans to collaborate with his successor. In the December meeting, he gave a different answer to a similar question: "I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape," he said. "I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place." After dodging an initial question about the retiring North Carolina senator's pledge not to vote for Trump's Fed nominees while the DOJ investigation continues, he answered a follow-up on political interference in monetary policy. "The point of independence isn't to protect policymakers," Powell said, arguing that it's intended to keep the central bank focused on the economy. After dodging an initial question about the retiring North Carolina senator's pledge not to vote for Trump's Fed nominees while the DOJ investigation continues, he answered a follow-up on political interference in monetary policy. "The point of independence isn't to protect policymakers," Powell said, arguing that it's intended to keep the central bank focused on the economy. "Every advanced economy, democracy around the world has come around to this common practice. It's just an institutional arrangement that has served the people well. That is, to have a separation, to not have direct elected official control over the setting of monetary policy," Powell said. He noted that monetary policy could be used to affect electoral outcomes, and said that it would be "hard to restore the credibility of the institution" if the Fed's neutrality from political independence is lost. Powell said there was "broad support" on the FOMC for holding today, including among non-voters. Though "there are different views on the committee" over which side of the dual mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — takes priority when data is ambiguous. He said that the majority of tariff impacts have moved through the economy, and trade policy is a reason why inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal. If consumer prices begin to ease, or if job market challenges improve, it might call for looser policy. Powell said the Fed is well-positioned to balance its dual mandate and "the economy is growing at a solid pace." He said "inflation performed as expected" and there are some optimistic signs in the labor market, even if hiring remains low. But he made no promises on future rate cuts. "Policy is not on a preset course," he said. "We're making decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis." He said policy is currently neutral or somewhat restricted. "It's in the eye of the beholder," he said. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet's senior economist, said the latest decision means the Fed views the job market "as cool, but stable," so they can now focus on the stubborn inflation rate that remains above the Fed's target. "If the labor market data indicated convincing or inevitable weakness, they'd cut, but that simply isn't the case," Renter said.

"If the labor market data indicated convincing or inevitable weakness, they'd cut, but that simply isn't the case," Renter said. Kay Haigh, global cohead of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said "moderation in inflation allows for two further 'normalization' cuts" to bring rates back to where the Fed thinks they won't overheat or excessively cool the economy. However, if the Fed continues to hold rates steady in the months ahead, it could mean consumers don't see relief for a while. "Given the likely pause in further interest rate cuts, consumers waiting for further interest rate reductions before purchasing vehicles or homes, or refinancing existing higher-rate mortgages, will likely need to wait a bit longer," said Charlie Wise, senior vice president of research and consulting at TransUnion. The US dollar has weakened over recent days, but Powell said it's "not appropriate" for Fed leaders to comment on markets or currency. "We do monetary policy and some other things but we don't comment on the dollar," he said. The first question in the press conference was on Powell's recent visit to the Supreme Court in the Lisa Cook case. While he said it's not okay for him to respond to comments from political officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, he said it was the "most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history," so he felt it was appropriate to attend the oral arguments. He said he was "not going to expand" on his video statement on the DOJ investigation and did not confirm if the Fed has responded to grand jury subpoenas. Powell said he "didn't want to get into" his future at the central bank when asked about remaining on the FOMC through 2028. To open the press conference, Powell said the economy is "coming into 2026 on firm footing." The Fed is focused on its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, he said, and the US employment rate has seen "some signs of stabilization." He said that consumer sentiment is "resilient," though job gains have remained low, the housing sector is "weak" and the recent government shutdown weighed on economic activity. The economic situation is becoming more balanced, but there is still a decline in labor force growth due to low demand and declining immigration. This calls for steady rates, he said. The Fed may be holding rates steady, but the central bank did make a notable change to its economic picture this month. In Wednesday's news release, FOMC leaders removed the phrase "downside risks to employment rose in recent months," which has been included in almost every release from the past few months. The committee said that job gains remain low and inflation is still somewhat elevated, but removing the "downside risks to employment" phrase from the Fed's economic assessment is good news for job seekers. It means Powell and company see a labor market in recovery. Powell will begin the Fed's January press conference at 2:30 p.m. He will give an overview of the current economic situation, including the inflation and employment data the Fed is closely watching. The central bank chair will then take questions from journalists. We expect Powell will be asked about the DOJ probe, ongoing political pressure from the Trump administration, tariffs, the impact of AI on the job market, and more. Powell's answers could foreshadow future monetary policy and plans for his final months at the Fed. Major indexes were flat after the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged. "Focus, naturally, now turns to Chair Powell's press conference," wrote Michael Brown, senior strategist at Pepperstone. "Powell will likely, again, note that the FFR is now within a reasonable range of estimates as to where the neutral rate may lie, though will probably steer well clear of any questions on his plans post-May, or on ongoing attempts to erode the Fed's policy independence."

The S&P 500 was in the red after the decision, reversing an earlier rally that had brought the benchmark index above 7,000 for the first time ever. The committee has had a split on interest rates at every meeting since July — and this month is no different. Ten FOMC members, including Powell, voted in favor of the hold, but there were two dissents. Stephan Miran and Christopher Waller preferred a quarter-point cut. The Fed will hold its benchmark interest rate steady between 3.5 and 3.75%, in alignment with expectations. The move breaks a pattern of rate cuts over the past several months. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to discuss. Central bank decisions trickle down to consumers through mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, and savings accounts. The borrowing rates for these typically follow the same pattern as the Fed. Higher interest rates can help curb rising prices, but still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes over time. It's unlikely Americans will feel the impact of a single rate call, but sustained cuts or hikes can have an effect over time. The typically uniform Fed has been increasingly divided in its decisions. At the December meeting, the FOMC had its most split call since September 2019 with three dissents. Recent Trump appointee Stephen Miran repeatedly voted for steeper rate cuts last year. Others, like Jeffrey R. Schmid, urged a more cautious stance. It's possible that January's rate call will be another split decision for the committee. Top contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder, Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Rieder is leading prediction markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is in charge of the process, though any nominees are likely to hit roadblocks in Congress over the DOJ probe. "The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed," Elizabeth Renter, the senior economist at NerdWallet, said. "A Fed that is vulnerable to political pressure is one that will struggle to be effective at guiding economic stability." Read full story Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower interest rates, threatening to fire Powell and dubbing him with the moniker "Too Late." The president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on monetary policy. "I'm a smart voice and should be listened to," he said. Trump added in his Davos speech that he's interviewing potential Powell successors: "Everyone that I interviewed is great. Everyone could do, I think, a fantastic job," he said, continuing, "It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad, sort of disloyalty." Stocks were steady ahead of the rate decision and Jerome Powell's press conference. The S&P 500 pulled back from its record above 7,000 as the tech-led rally stuttered. Markets will be listening closely for updates from Powell on where he sees interest rates going through the rest of his term, but also any clues that could hint at what his successor might do. "Markets expect Chair Powell to end his leadership term without cutting rates again. They also believe that his successor will be similarly cautious, with heavy odds (+70 percent) that Fed Funds will be within 25 basis points of 3.0 percent in December 2027," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, on Wednesday. Both the DOJ probe and Cook case have sparked widespread concern over the Fed's future, as the bank has long operated as independent and nonpartisan. Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors. "We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell," the letter from global bank leaders read. "The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve." The Trump administration accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud in August and attempted to fire her, though she has remained in her seat. Her case was heard by the Supreme Court last week, and several judges expressed disagreement with the White House. "Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve," said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.

Powell attended oral arguments for the case in support of Cook, but did not give testimony. The DOJ probe around Powell's testimony about the Fed renovations is ongoing. Markets and political leaders will be watching Powell's comments in this afternoon's press conference closely. Beyond posting the uncharacteristic video message online to announce the subpoena, he hasn't spoken publicly about the investigation. The effective import tariff rate has spiked to the highest in decades. Experts have been keeping an eye on just how much tariffs have affected inflation. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said it's challenging to know the extent to which tariffs have had an effect because there are other headwinds, such as supply chain and inventory issues. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said tariffs had some effect on goods inflation, but hadn't resulted in a massive surge.

US stocks cruised to records at the open on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 for the first time ever. Traders were bracing for the Fed decision, as well as critical earnings updates from mega-cap tech. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft are due to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Markets are broadly expecting to rates to remain unchanged today. The CME FedWatch Tool shows 97% odds of the target rate remaining in the range of 3.5-3.75%. Views on Wall Street are also mixed on whether the market can expect one or two cuts in 2026.

Views on Wall Street are also mixed on whether the market can expect one or two cuts in 2026. Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management, said, "we expect just one rate cut for 2026, and while the timing of this next rate cut is debatable, it will likely come towards the second half of the year" with a new Fed chair. Fed members can look back at last year's inflation to inform their coming interest rate decision. The inflation rate, based on the consumer price index, ended 2025 lower than it started but remained above the Fed's 2% target. The year-over-year percent change in the shelter index continued to cool from its 2023 peak. The unemployment rate has been at least 4% since June 2024, and ended 2025 at 4.4%. This is historically low, but it comes alongside limited vacancies, low hiring rates, and a decline in the number of Americans quitting their jobs or changing roles compared to a few years ago. Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said last year's job market ended "with a fizzle rather than a bang." The US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, the lowest since 2003, outside recessions. Economists and job-market experts told Business Insider that the job market was in a low-fire, low-hire environment, partly due to economic uncertainty and reduced demand after the pandemic recovery and the Great Resignation. It's likely Fed leaders will stick to the status quo in January, in hopes that steady rates will push inflation closer to their 2% goal. Affordability is a major concern for American households, as prices rise on housing, groceries, healthcare, and more. Powell has consistently prioritized price stability during his time as chair. The Fed is expected to cut rates at least once later this year, a move that could ease costs for borrowers and juice the job market. Powell's term as chair ends in May, but he's eligible to remain on the Fed committee until early 2028. It's rare for former chairs to stay on as governors, and Powell has not indicated his plans. But there's been some speculation from Wall Streeters that Trump's threats to the Fed could entice Powell to remain at the bank longer than expected. The DOJ probe news sparked alarm among politicians, economists, and business leaders, many of whom are concerned about the future of the central bank. Powell's term as chair expires in May, and Trump is set to announce his next pick for the role in the coming weeks. Both Democratic and Republican leaders have signaled the probe jeopardizes the search for Powell's successor.

"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none," North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said, adding that he will oppose any Trump nominees to the central bank until "this legal matter is fully resolved." With around 7.5 hours until the Fed's latest rate decision is announced, things are a bit of a mixed bag in financial markets on Wednesday. As of 6:30 a.m. ET futures for the three major US indexes are trending higher, with the Nasdaq leading the way, signaling a nearly 1% rise at the open. That's due in large part to its tech focus, with many of the biggest tech firms reporting earnings this week.

Elsewhere, futures for the S&P 500 are 0.4% higher, while the Dow Jones is up less than 0.1%.

Gold's record rally is continuing on Wednesday, with the precious metal extending its gain by another 3% to trade just under $5,300 per ounce. Silver is also higher, gaining 5.4% to trade at $111 per ounce. Powell posted a video message on January 11 announcing that the Fed received a grand jury subpoena. The Trump administration alleges that Powell committed perjury during a June appearance before Congress, where he discussed renovations to the central bank's Washington, DC, buildings. Business Insider obtained a letter Powell privately sent to senators detailing the Fed's construction plans and budget — the details of which match his testimony. Powell said that the probe, which could result in a criminal indictment, is an escalation of ongoing pressure from the White House.

The Federal Open Market Committee has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. Fed leaders opted for three quarter-point cuts last fall after months of steady monetary policy. The White House and investors are hopeful for a looser approach to interest rates in 2026. But Powell is in a tough spot: Lower rates could speed up a slow job market, but risk a rise in inflation.

Title: Bitcoin: Can Asia catch up as U.S. BTC ETFs control global liquidity?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-can-asia-catch-up-as-u-s-bitcoin-etfs-control-global-liquidity/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T06:45:31Z
Full Content:
U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now drive crypto liquidity and sentiment, while Asia’s policy-constrained market lags. Asia’s crypto ETF market remains developing rather than mature, despite early progress. Hong Kong leads the region, launching Asia’s first spot for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs in 2024. By the end of Q3 2025, AUM had reached roughly $920 million before moderating to about $340 million in spot BTC ETFs in January 2026. This showed that growth is stronger in percentage terms, yet scale remains limited. Meanwhile, the monetary authorities of Singapore, Japan, and South Korea remain cautious. As a result, Asia competes conceptually but not yet structurally, positioning itself as an emerging, policy-driven follower rather than a global ETF leader. Japan lags materially. The Financial Services Agency is targeting spot Bitcoin ETFs no earlier than 2028, with legislation planned for 2026 to reclassify crypto as “specified assets,” emphasizing custody and investor protection. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs decisively outperform their Asian counterparts in scale, liquidity, and market influence. As of late January 2026, the United States market holds roughly $118-120 billion AUM and over 611,000 BTC, while Hong Kong remains constrained near $250-340 million. Source: CoinGlass This disparity reflects faster U.S. regulatory execution, deeper capital pools, and highly efficient creation-redemption systems. As a result, issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity dominate flows, supported by authorized participants that convert ETF demand directly into spot BTC buying or selling. Source: CoinGlass As a result, U.S. ETF inflows often reinforce bullish momentum, while sharp outflows amplify downside moves, shaping sentiment and price discovery across crypto markets. Asia’s ETFs largely track price passively, whereas U.S. products actively transmit macro signals, institutional positioning, and risk sentiment into Bitcoin’s short-term movements. This dynamic cements U.S. ETFs as the primary drivers of global crypto liquidity and market psychology. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dipped toward the $86,500–$87,000 zone, while gold and silver rallied to new highs above $5,000/oz and $100–110/oz. This divergence underscored risk-on versus safe-haven dynamics amid rising macro uncertainty. The Bitcoin pullback reflected ETF-related fragility layered on broader risk-off forces, not an isolated ETF shock. Source: X However, yen strength, U.S. shutdown risks, and defensive positioning remained the primary drivers. ETFs amplified volatility but did not initiate it. Globally, U.S. ETFs dominate activity, while Hong Kong products stay largely inactive. All in all, U.S. ETFs dictate global crypto liquidity and sentiment, while Asia remains policy-constrained and macro forces continue to dominate short-term market direction. Moreover, macro forces ultimately determine the direction of short-term cryptocurrency.

Title: BlackRock Files Bitcoin Premium Income ETF: What It Could Mean For BTC

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock has filed an S-1 for an “iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF,” a product that aims to track bitcoin’s price while generating option premium by systematically selling calls tied primarily to its own spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT. For BTC-linked derivatives markets, the filing is being read less as a directional catalyst and more as another potential source of mechanical volatility supply. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas flagged the document on X, noting that key commercial details are still missing. “BlackRock just dropped the official S-1 for it’s upcoming iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF.. no fee or ticker yet,” Balchunas wrote. “The strategy is to ‘track performance of the price of bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options primarily on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on ETP Indices.’” BlackRock just dropped the official S-1 for it’s upcoming iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF.. no fee or ticker yet. The strategy is to “track performance of the price of bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options… pic.twitter.com/CZDahm4mNj — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 26, 2026 The basic premise is familiar to anyone who has watched covered-call equity ETFs: sell upside to monetize implied volatility. In bitcoin’s case, the underlying options are written on an ETF wrapper rather than directly on BTC, but the economic effect is similar, steady call overwriting can increase supply of short-dated upside exposure and compress the premiums available to sellers over time, particularly if multiple products pursue comparable programs. That dynamic was the focus of commentary from Wintermute’s head of OTC trading, Jake Ostrovskis, who framed the filing as additive to an already crowded volatility-selling landscape. “BTC vols already suffer from significant oversupply following the rollout of ETFs, SP’s & options on IBIT,” Ostrovskis posted. “Now add more mechanical vol selling and the only logical outcome is further steady decline in yield from market-implied premiums.” The implication is not that bitcoin’s price must fall because a premium-income ETF exists, but that the “income” component could become harder to sustain at attractive levels if implied volatility continues to be leaned on by systematic call sellers. In that world, headline yields may drift lower, and the payoff profile becomes increasingly path-dependent, premium capture in quiet regimes can look reliable, but it can also leave investors structurally underexposed to sharp upside moves if BTC trends higher through the strikes being sold. For market participants trying to extract option premia from BTC exposure, Ostrovskis argued the edge shifts away from simply being short vol and toward execution and distribution. “Structuring/timing + leaning on axes via OTC desks will become increasingly important to optimise returns on otherwise dormant assets,” he wrote, pointing to the growing role of bespoke structuring, strike selection, tenor management, and liquidity access as the trade becomes more crowded. If BlackRock proceeds and demand materializes, the next question for traders will be how much incremental call supply the strategy represents relative to existing IBIT options activity and whether that supply concentrates in specific expiries or strikes. Either way, the filing underscores a broader maturation trend: as BTC exposure becomes more ETF-native, the center of gravity for volatility pricing may continue to migrate toward the wrapper’s options market, with implied premiums increasingly shaped by systematic flows rather than discretionary views.

Title: From marginal experiment to global market infrastructure: Tokenization is rewriting finance
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/from-marginal-experiment-to-global-market-infrastructure-tokenization-is-rewriting-finance/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T04:00:41Z
Full Content:
Tokenization is reshaping finance by modernizing market infrastructure without altering legal classifications. Laura Estefanía, Founder & CEO of Conquista PR, advises Web3 companies on media strategy and crisis communications. She leads communications at Asecrypto, Spain’s top crypto association, and speaks globally on tech, AI, and Web3. The following is a guest post and opinion from Laura Estefania, Founder and CEO of Conquista PR. The past decade of digital assets has been shaped as much by debacle as by innovation. High-profile collapses, sensational headlines, and regulatory whiplash distorted public perception, leaving technologies capable of modernizing global finance viewed through a lens of suspicion. Beneath that noise, however, tokenization has quietly crossed an irreversible threshold. As recent analysis by Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein makes clear, tokenization is no longer an experiment. It is becoming part of the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The constraint today is not technological maturity, it is perception. Tokenization is edging closer to becoming a mainstream capital raising tool. The efficiency gains and benefits of broader access are simply too big to ignoreIssuers in growing economies have an unrivaled opportunity to boost market inclusion through blockchain-native capital raises.” Perception in finance shapes real outcomes. It influences capital formation, informs regulatory posture, and determines whether institutions feel confident enough to integrate new systems. The problem is not that tokenization lacks technical readiness. The problem is that it is still being judged through the legacy optics of past crypto excesses. In finance, perception becomes a gating mechanism. It defines what decision-makers feel allowed to deploy. Tokenization does not expand the regulatory perimeter or rewrite who may invest in which instruments. Securities laws, investor classifications, and jurisdictional restrictions remain firmly in place. What changes is the infrastructure through which compliant participation is executed, monitored, and scaled. Tokenization tends to improve: Tokenization does not automatically change: Fractional ownership is not a legal breakthrough. Corporate equity has always been divisible, and debt has long been issued in varied denominations. The limiting factor has been operational, not conceptual. Traditional market plumbing makes granular participation inefficient due to: By recording ownership as a verifiable digital entry that can move at the speed of information, tokenization removes friction. What was legally permissible but economically impractical becomes viable at scale. Major asset managers are already building regulated tokenized products and settlement rails, including initiatives tied to BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. None of this is speculative or ideological. It is infrastructure improvement. Yet tokenization is still evaluated through the afterimage of prior market failures, where retail speculation and platform collapses dominated the public story. That misalignment risks slowing adoption precisely where tokenization offers measurable benefits: lower costs, faster settlement, and greater transparency. The consequence is simple: institutions hesitate, even when the technology is ready and the use case is already regulated. Outside the West, tokenization is often less a theory and more a practical response to structural friction. In many emerging markets, the challenge is not replacing a highly efficient banking system, it is compensating for one that can be fragmented, slow, and expensive to access. Common pain points include: Tokenization does not remove regulatory constraints, but it can reduce operational frictions that inflate the effective cost of capital. Faster settlement, transparent ownership records, and programmable compliance reduce reliance on intermediaries, allowing global liquidity to reach local projects with fewer layers of cost and delay. This dynamic is discussed in broader regional adoption research, including the Milken Institute’s coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa’s digital asset landscape here. In the U.S. and Europe, regulatory attention remains heavily oriented toward classification and containment, even as stablecoins and tokenized government securities already move significant value across borders. Institutions run pilots, then pause. Not because the tech fails, but because reputational risk and public perception still blur “market infrastructure” with “speculative activity.” Citi, for example, projects that tokenization of financial and real-world assets in private markets alone could reach the trillions by 2030. Yet many institutions still treat tokenization as optional experimentation rather than inevitable modernization. This is not merely a communication problem. It is a competitive one. Jurisdictions that assess tokenization through efficiency, risk management, and capital flow optimization are pulling ahead, while others preserve complexity the rest of the world is actively designing around. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. For a discussion of how major institutions approach on-chain experimentation, see CryptoSlate’s coverage here. Tokenization does not need evangelism. It needs comprehension, and regulators willing to judge financial infrastructure by outcomes rather than optics. Under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Europe has prioritized standardization. MiCA does not regulate tokenized securities, those remain governed by existing capital-markets law. Instead, it sets rules for crypto-assets that fall outside traditional financial regulation, including governance, disclosure, and reserve management for certain on-chain settlement instruments. That clarity improves institutional readability, which is a prerequisite for banks, asset managers, and custodians to engage at scale (MiCA text and implementing materials can be accessed via EUR-Lex). Rather than a single pan-regional framework, Gulf jurisdictions have emphasized structured rollout: sandboxes, phased licensing, and regulator-led pilots that move tokenized deposits, funds, and payment instruments from proof-of-concept to production. You can see examples of this regulatory posture through bodies such as ADGM and the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority. Different strategies, same logic: Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) in October 2025 said: The FSRA continues to enhance its digital asset regulatory framework to remain forward-looking and responsive to the next wave of financial innovation, including tokenization, DeFi and AI-driven market participation. Our approach balances innovation with strong governance, risk-based supervision, and alignment with global standards. We are committed to enabling digital asset firms to scale within a well-regulated international financial centre that prioritises transparency, resilience, and long-term stability. Tokenization becomes operationally powerful because it replaces fragmented legacy workflows with a single programmable ledger. In practice, this can mean: What was always legally possible but operationally inefficient becomes feasible at scale. Finance is being rewired in parallel across regions that rarely move in sync. The technology is mature, demand is visible, and regulatory pathways are no longer hypothetical. What has changed most decisively is not the code, but the context in which it is now understood. Tokenization is moving out of yesterday’s headlines and into the domain of policy, prudential supervision, and institutional balance sheets. Once tokenization is understood as infrastructure, the burden of proof reverses. The question becomes not whether it belongs in the financial system, but how efficiently it can be deployed, supervised, and scaled. If you only read one section, read this: Tokenization’s formative debate is ending. What follows is an execution phase, defined less by ideology and more by governance, interoperability, and speed. The markets that recognize this earliest will not merely adopt tokenization, they will help define how global finance operates in its next iteration. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. DTCC and Nasdaq still need nightly pauses, while crypto perps never close. And they’re already absorbing real price discovery. T+0 is the kind of plumbing change that decides whether tokenization stays a pilot or becomes the market.

Title: Valour wins FCA approval to offer Bitcoin, Ether ETPs to UK retail investors

The rollout comes as UK regulators reopen the retail market to crypto-related products and global issuers expand regulated offerings. Cointelegraph in your social feed Valour, the UK subsidiary of digital asset company DeFi Technologies, has begun offering crypto exchange-traded products to UK retail investors on the London Stock Exchange following recent regulatory changes. In a Monday notice, DeFi Technologies said the products are being offered in line with new FCA guidance allowing retail access to crypto exchange-traded products tied to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The offerings, called 1Valour Bitcoin Physical Staking and 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking, began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday. “The UK is one of the world's most important financial markets, and these approvals broaden our ability to serve UK retail investors with transparent, exchange-listed products that provide straightforward exposure to the evolving digital asset economy,” said Johan Wattenström, DeFi Technologies chairman and CEO. The company announced in September that it would list a Bitcoin staking ETP on the London Stock Exchange, but this was limited to professional investors, in contrast to Monday’s offering, which was targeted to UK retail investors. The FCA lifted a ban on crypto ETPs for retail investors in October, prompting offerings from asset managers such as Bitwise. The move by Valour builds upon the company’s efforts in Brazil, where it launched an exchange-traded product tied to Solana (SOL) in December. Cointelegraph reached out to Valour for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Related: Solana enters Brazil’s main exchange as Valour expands regulated crypto access According to the London Stock Exchange, more than 50 issuers list more than 2,300 ETPs. The exchange reportedly recorded about $280 million in trading volume for crypto ETPs in December. CoinShares reported on Monday that exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies saw more than $1.7 billion of outflows last week. The company’s head of research, James Butterfill, attributed the change from $2.2 billion of inflows the previous week to “dwindling expectations for interest rate cuts, negative price momentum and disappointment that digital assets have not participated in the debasement trade.” Some of the largest asset managers offering crypto ETPs and exchange-traded funds include Grayscale Investments, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock.

Title: VanEck expands crypto ETF lineup with spot Avalanche product

Time Published: 2026-01-26T20:08:16Z

The newly launched fund offers exchange-traded exposure to AVAX as other proposed Avalanche ETFs remain under regulatory review. Cointelegraph in your social feed Global asset manager VanEck has launched a US-listed exchange-traded product offering exposure to Avalanche’s native token, AVAX (AVAX), marking the first spot Avalanche ETF to trade in the United States. According to Monday’s announcement, the product is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, though it may be subject to other US securities laws. The fund will trade under the ticker VAVX, tracking the price of Avalanche’s AVAX token and potentially generating returns through staking. VanEck said it will waive sponsor fees on the ETF’s first $500 million in assets through Feb. 28. Assets over $500 million before Feb. 28 will be charged a 0.20% sponsor fee, which will apply to all assets after that date. Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at VanEck, told Cointelegraph that the ETF wrapper opens access to the RIA and wealth management market, as well as for institutions to capture “network yield through a standard exchange-traded product without the risk or complexity of managing the infrastructure themselves.” Avalanche is an open-source blockchain network for decentralized applications and smart contracts that went live in September 2020 and is developed by Ava Labs, a startup founded by Cornell University computer scientist Emin Gün Sirer. AVAX had a market capitalization of $5.1 billion at the time of writing and was trading at $11.76. The token is down about 92% from its November 2021 all-time high of $144.96 and about 69% over the past year, according to CoinGecko data. VanEck first sought to launch an Avalanche ETF in March 2025, when it filed an S-1 registration statement with US regulators. In April 2025, Nasdaq followed with a rule-change filing requesting approval to list and trade the proposed Avalanche ETF, a required step before the product could come to market. The fund’s launch may pave the way for additional Avalanche spot ETFs that are already in the regulatory pipeline. Grayscale Investments currently operates an Avalanche trust and filed in August 2025 to convert the product into a spot ETF, while Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 registration for an AVAX spot ETF in September 2025. Related: US Bitcoin ETFs bleed $1.72B in five-day outflow streak According to an X post from Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, on Monday BlackRock filed an S-1 registration statement for its proposed iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, which seeks to track Bitcoin’s (BTC) price while generating income by selling call options primarily on shares of its spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. The filing reflects a broader shift in crypto exchange-traded products, as issuers increasingly design ETFs that combine digital assets with portfolio strategies and risk management features rather than offering simple price exposure alone. In December, Amplify ETFs launched two blockchain-focused ETFs on NYSE Arca. The Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) track diversified indexes of companies building infrastructure and generating revenue from stablecoins and tokenized assets. Bitwise Asset Management also filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch 11 single-token “strategy” crypto ETFs, a move that would expand its product lineup by offering regulated exposure to major altcoins including Near (NEAR), Sui (SUI), Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Bittensor (TAO) and Zcash (ZEC). Asset manager 21Shares recently launched its Bitcoin Gold ETP, BOLD, on the London Stock Exchange, offering a single exchange-traded product that combines exposure to Bitcoin and gold, with roughly two-thirds allocated to gold and one-third to Bitcoin and trading in both pounds sterling and US dollars.

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BitMine Immersion Technologies executed its largest 2026 Ethereum acquisition, purchasing 40,302 ETH and pushing its holdings to 4.24 million tokens valued at $12.05 billion. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) acquired 40,302 ETH last week, marking its biggest Ethereum ETH $2 999 24h volatility: 0.4% Market cap: $362.27 B Vol. 24h: $23.24 B purchase in 2026 as the company accelerates toward owning 5% of total supply. The firm now holds 4,243,338 ETH, valued at $12.05 billion, representing 3.52% of Ethereum’s 120.7 million token supply, according to its January 26 announcement, and it’s confirmed by Coingecko data. BitMine remains the world’s largest corporate Ethereum treasury, a position it has held while executing an aggressive accumulation strategy throughout 2025 and into early 2026. The company’s total crypto and cash holdings reached $12.8 billion, including 193 Bitcoin BTC $88 933 24h volatility: 0.2% Market cap: $1.78 T Vol. 24h: $45.98 B , $682 million in cash, and $219 million in strategic investments, based on its press release. 🧵BitMine provided its latest holdings update for January 26th, 2026: $12.8 billion in total crypto + "moonshots":– 4,243,338 ETH at $2,839 (@coinbase)– 193 Bitcoin (BTC)– $200 mllion stake in Beast Industries @MrBeast – $19 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: $ORBS)… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 26, 2026 In the company’s press release, they add selected nine positive mentions of different global leaders like Donald Trump and the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, about digital assets, showing a positive sentiment around crypto, like Ethereum at the World Economic Forum in Davos, prompted Lee to state, “Ethereum remains the most widely used by Wall Street today and most reliable blockchain with zero downtime since inception”. This new acquisition follows BitMine shareholders’ January approval to increase authorized shares with 81% support, enabling continued treasury expansion. Also, the company has staked 2,009,267 ETH, worth $5.7 billion, generating an estimated $374 million in staking fees annually at the 2.81% Composite Ethereum Staking Rate (the average yield across major staking providers). The company plans to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) staking infrastructure in Q1 2026 to enhance returns. NYSE American-listed BMNR stock traded at $28.63 on January 26, fluctuating between $27.60 and $28.74 during the session with an average volume of 44 million shares, according to Yahoo! Finance. The stock maintains its position as the 91st most actively traded in the US, averaging $1.2 billion in daily volume over the past five days, despite lacking much upward momentum in 2026. BitMine’s purchase led, again, the trend of corporate Ethereum accumulation in 2026, with Hong Kong-based Trend Research acquiring 41,500 ETH for approximately $126 million using decentralized borrowing through Aave, rather than traditional equity sales. The BitMine strategy positions it nearly 70% toward its goal of controlling 5% of Ethereum’s supply, as the corporate Ethereum treasury trend accelerates in early 2026.

BlackRock wants to expand its Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings. The world’s largest asset manager has filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new “iShares Bitcoin Premium Income” ETF. If approved, the new product’s assets will consist primarily of BTC, shares of BlackRock’s flagship spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and cash. However, the new ETF would also include an actively managed component, according to the new filing. Explains BlackRock, “The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on indices that track spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products, including IBIT.” The asset management giant says Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the new ETF’s custodian for Bitcoin holdings, with Anchorage Digital Bank available as an alternative custodian. BNY would administer the trust and custody its cash and securities. In addition to IBIT, BlackRock also offers the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which tracks the price of ETH, and the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC), which tracks the investment results of an index composed of firms involved in blockchain and crypto technologies.
