Title: BlackRock expands real estate holdings, buys ElmTree Funds with $7.3 billion in assets

BlackRock Inc has announced its agreement to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate firm which leases custom-built commercial properties to single-tenant renters. The acquisition will add an investor with $7.3 billion in total assets under management to BlackRock’s portfolio. ElmTree will be integrated into Private Financing Solutions, BlackRock’s newly established platform created through the firm’s $12 billion purchase of HPS Investment Partners last year, Bloomberg reported. The payment for ElmTree will primarily be settled in stock, with the potential for additional consideration based on ElmTree’s performance over the next five years. While the purchase price and other financial details aren’t yet disclosed, the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year. The real estate firm was founded in 2011 by James G. Koman who currently also serves as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the firm. ElmTree has offices in various locations, including St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Austin, Phoenix and Newport Beach, California. Other than that, the firm also has investments in 122 properties across the 31 cities of the United States. The deal will allow ElmTree, which is currently focusing on industrial real estate, to expand into new markets as an owner-operator, according to the statement cited by Bloomberg. “Our specialized bricks-and-mortar expertise will be augmented by HPS’s ability to provide financing and other solutions,” James Koman, ElmTree’s founder and CEO, said in the statement. While the ElmTree purchase is considered small compared to the $11.6 trillion in assets that BlackRock oversees in recent times, it deepens CEO Larry Fink’s objective to tap into private markets over the past two years in search of heftier fees. BlackRock has also bought other real estate firms such as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners as part of its acquisition spree in this particular industry, the news agency reported.

Firms are feeling the heat of reducing carbon footprints, maximising energy usage, and working within carbon credit trading programs. Climate credit analytics is a suite of tools that work together to monitor emissions, estimate the environmental footprint that results, and prescribe interventions such as carbon offsetting and investment in clean energy. The U.S. Climate Credit Analytics Market was valued at USD 0.82 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 3.26 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 18.84% during the forecast period of 2025–2032. The United States is ahead in climate credit analytics adoption through the intersection of policy imperatives, technological transformation, and corporate climate leadership. Pro-climate policies like the Inflation Reduction Act financially reward companies doing carbon accounting, investing in clean technologies, and aligning with global climate goals.

This expansion is driven by surging corporate net-zero pledges and increased environmental regulations. Many others are also getting the job done because companies are increasingly looking to them to track emissions for sustainability reporting, with platforms like IBM’s Environmental Intelligence Suite, and the carbon offsetting analytics market is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 21.12% CAGR throughout the forecast period. The rush is fueled by an increasing appetite for top-grade, verifiable carbon credits. Companies like Shell and Delta Air Lines now employ AI and satellite data, via platforms such as Pachama and Sylvera, to verify offset projects and make sure they are transparent. By Industry The BFSI segment is anticipated to be the fastest-growing market with a CAGR growth rate of 21.68% over the forecast period. Financial Markets Climate-related financial risks are coming onto the regulatory radar, and financial institutions are integrating into their risk models, investment decisions, and stress tests the results of climate credit analytics. Firms like BlackRock and HSBC are able not just to measure carbon exposure at the portfolio level, for example, but also create sustainable finance products by employing ESG frameworks and analytics platforms. Growing investor interest in sustainable investment opportunities, as well as regulatory attention to financial information, are also important triggers to the growth of this market.

Already, the region is an early adopter of AI and blockchain for emissions monitoring and has a mature ESG ecosystem. Europe is a close second, having successfully implemented climate policies, such as the EU ETS or the CSRD. Germany is a leader in decarbonization and the use of renewable energy. The APAC region is anticipated to register the highest CAGR of 20.54%, due to industrial growth, changing regulations, and the unveiling of national carbon markets, especially in China and South Korea. The Middle East & Africa and Latin America, however, are potential regions. Countries such as the UAE and Brazil are now making climate policy part of their national development strategy by investing in green finance and analytic platforms to accomplish long-term sustainability goals.

July 07, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Victus Global Victus Global Road Town, British Virgin Islands, July 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At Victus Global, we partner with visionary projects and founders shaping the future of Web3. As a full-stack advisory firm and venture partner, we provide hands-on support across investments, market making, listings, advisory, and marketing. Through our global network and deep industry insight, we help innovative projects navigate the complex journey from idea to impact. Below are five of the groundbreaking projects we're proud to feature as part of our ongoing commitment to supporting Web3 innovation—at a time when the digital asset space is entering what could be its most pivotal quarter yet.The Crypto Comeback: Why Q4 2025 Is Poised to Be a Pivotal Quarter for Digital AssetsAfter a volatile yet maturing year for crypto markets, Q4 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout quarter for digital assets. From the re-emergence of institutional confidence to rapidly evolving blockchain infrastructure, the landscape is transitioning from cautious recovery to accelerated innovation. A closer look at both macro and micro signals reveals why the final months of 2025 may mark a meaningful shift—and highlights several projects worth watching.Market Recovery Gaining TractionFollowing the sobering effects of the 2022–2023 bear market, crypto entered 2025 with a strong bounce-back narrative. According to CoinGecko’s Q2 2025 industry report, the total market cap of digital assets has grown 38.5% YTD, led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which saw 24% and 31% respective gains. Layer 2 protocols, particularly Arbitrum and Base, outpaced Layer 1s in user growth and transaction volume—signaling a shift in developer and user priorities. Notably, stablecoins also reversed their 18-month contraction, with Tether (USDT) and USDC collectively increasing their circulation by $15B between April and June. This return of sidelined capital suggests rising investor confidence and growing demand for on-chain liquidity.Institutional Appetite on the RiseA renewed institutional push is underway. BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund, BUIDL, surpassed $500M in assets in July 2025, making it the fastest-growing RWA (real-world asset) product to date. JPMorgan’s Onyx platform also crossed a major milestone, processing over $2B in intraday tokenized repo trades in June alone.The reintroduction of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, expected before year-end pending SEC finalization, may act as a catalyst for further capital inflows. Bernstein projects that tokenized assets could exceed $10 trillion by 2030—a prediction increasingly echoed by global banks and asset managers.Meanwhile, European MiCA regulations, which went live in July 2024, have brought renewed clarity for crypto custodians, exchanges, and stablecoin issuers. This legal framework has been crucial in attracting traditional finance participants across the EU.A Q4 Set for Strategic MomentumQ4 has historically been one of crypto’s strongest quarters, with BTC posting positive returns in 7 of the past 10 years during this period. But seasonality is only part of the picture. In 2025, several structural and narrative drivers converge: These dynamics are creating fertile ground for selective outperformance—especially among projects with tangible infrastructure plays and community-first adoption Strategies.Promising Projects to Watch in Q4 2025As the market matures, standout projects are those that combine narrative relevance with real-world use cases and technical innovation. Here are five projects showing exceptional promise this quarter: Launched in April 2024, Shido is a Layer 1 PoS blockchain operating both EVM and WASM environments in parallel. This dual-VM design allows seamless communication between dApps built in either environment, offering flexibility for both Web3-native and Web2-transitioning developers. Shido scored a perfect 100/100 in its decentralized exchange audit and is integrating a proprietary liquidity bridge with top chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.Why It Matters: One of the few chains solving interoperability and developer UX at the architectural level and offering extensive scaling capabilities that adapt seamlessly with global advancements in Web3 technology. Tajir is building a modular blockchain ecosystem around its TJRM blockchain, tailored to manufacturing and enterprise needs. Its foundational exchange is live, with a decentralized wallet and crypto card program on the way. The goal: create seamless entry points for businesses to operate in a tokenized, transparent environment. Why It Matters: Tajir focuses on business-first blockchain tools rather than speculative finance—bridging legacy supply chains with Web3 efficiencies. Infinaeon is an Ethereum L2 that introduces an “ever-appreciating” economic model.Every transaction grows its liquidity layer (INF), and funds gas revenue-sharing for stakers and NFT holders. Its DEX, staking programs, and NFT-based income tools reward actual user activity—not hype cycles.Why It Matters: Infinaeon flips the inflationary token model by creating a feedback loop between utility, scarcity, and participation. Utility Born as a meme and evolved into a mission, DROP is leveraging the XRP Ledger to create a fully community-driven ecosystem. With $1M+ in XRPL AMM liquidity and an engaging play-to-earn game (DROP RUSH), it uses memes and gamification as onboarding tools for XRPL DeFi. Why It Matters: DROP proves meme coins can have real utility and grassroots community traction beyond speculative pumps. ICB Labs blends AI, blockchain, and digital identity to build a decentralized innovation hub. Its ICBX token powers everything from NFT-based KYC to tokenized solar energy income and AI avatars. Think of it as a protocol stack for sovereign digital lives.Why It Matters: ICB Labs is pioneering tools for decentralized governance, work, education, and energy—all within a cohesive ecosystem. Final Thoughts: Selectivity WinsWhile macro tailwinds and structural improvements suggest a strong Q4, investors and users alike are increasingly discerning. In a market moving from experimentation to real utility, only those projects with strong teams, meaningful integrations, and adaptive tokenomics are poised to endure—and thrive. Q4 2025 may not just be a bounce—it could be a breakout.

Title: Vitalik backs Ethereum’s gas cap rule – Right as $4.3B bets pile in from Wall Street!

A gas cap may sound boring – but it could be Ethereum’s smartest move yet. Ethereum [ETH] just got a new rule on the table — and it’s all about keeping things running smoothly. A fresh proposal, EIP-7983, wants to put a cap on how much gas a single transaction can use. The goal is to stop spammy attacks, tighten security, and make the network a little more predictable. With Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin backing the idea — and big players like BlackRock and U.S. President Donald Trump betting big on ETH — the timing couldn’t be more telling. Ethereum developers are warning us about single transactions that consume nearly the entire block’s Gas Limit. The proposed fix, EIP-7983, introduces a cap of 16.77 million gas units per transaction – no matter how high the block’s total gas limit is. The idea is to make the network more stable and prevent denial-of-service (DoS) risks. The proposal states, “Any block having a transaction with gasLimit > 16.77 million is deemed invalid and rejected…” Developers say most users won’t even feel the change, as “most transactions today fall well below the proposed cap.” That being said, institutional and high-profile interest in Ethereum is hitting new highs. BlackRock now holds a staggering $4.38 billion in ETH, commanding 42.8% of all institutional Ethereum holdings. Source: X According to World Liberty Fi, one $181.7 million whale allocated 95 percent of its assets to Ethereum, about $173.3 million. Source: X Five Ethereum treasury companies currently hold a combined 240,000 ETH, worth around $600 million. Source: X And more are lining up; Tom Lee’s BitMine plans to buy $250 million worth of ETH soon. Leading the pack is SharpLink Gaming with 198,167 ETH in its treasury, followed by Bit Digital and BTCS Inc. with 27,623 and 14,600 ETH respectively. The top three alone account for over 99% of all reported treasury holdings to date. With more treasuries expected to join in over the next year, Ethereum’s appeal as a long-term asset looks stronger than ever. ETH traded just above $2,560, showing modest gains but no explosive move yet. The RSI was at 54.93 at press time, suggesting neutral momentum. Source: TradingView However, the MACD is a bit more interesting: the indicator just flipped bullish, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. That, paired with a slight uptick in histogram bars, suggests growing upward momentum. While ETH has been range-bound since mid-June, the current setup hints at a possible breakout if buying volume picks up.

Title: Changing Times Brewery beers to be stocked in nine new premises as it moves outside Dublin

Changing Times Brewery, which was founded by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs, is expanding the number of premises serving its beers and moving outside the capital for the first time. The €2-million brewery, based in Glasnevin along the banks of the Royal Canal, is to be the exclusive draft stout and lager provider for The Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim. It will also be served in Cork’s Rising Sons Brewery Bar, The Fountain, and The Fran Well. An additional five venues in Dublin are also now stocking Changing Times beers. These are Neary’s, Searson’s, The Step Inn, The Sackville Lounge, and Kavanagh’s The Temple. The partnership with The Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo also means Changing Times Brewery will be the exclusive provider of draft stout and lager to the 70,000 visitors who travel to the popular Leitrim tourist attraction every year. Between growing the number of venues stocking its products and increased demand in the founding pubs, Changing Times is now producing more than 150 kegs per week, a figure that is expected to rise to 200 kegs per week before the end of the year. This is up from the 100 kegs per week it was brewing at the time of the launch. The brewery expects the increase will generate an additional €1.1 million in revenue by the end of 2026. The brewery’s backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. Other backers include the publican families behind venues such as Arthur Mayne’s in Donnybrook, The Bank on College Green, The Blackrock, The Bridge 1859, Devitt’s, Doheny and Nesbitt, The Ferryman, The Long Hall, McSorley’s and The Swan. Pat Rigney, owner of The Shed Distillery, which is home of Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, is another backer of Changing Times Brewery and also the group’s chairman. He said the story of the brewery was “clearly striking a chord with visitors”. “Our expectation is that will continue to grow as more venues stock Changing Times, delivering even more change in the future,” Mr Rigney said. Changing Times Brewery currently makes three draft products: Clockwork Velvet Stout, Daydreamer Lager, and After Hours Pale Ale. It is expected that additional products will be launched over the next 12 months. Noel Anderson, managing director of Grand Slam Bars and one of the founding publicans behind Changing Times Brewery, said there had been “tremendous interest” in the group’s products, which is “already exceeding our early projections for the brewery”.

Title: Hong Kong FinTech Can Drive Green Investment Stability in a Disrupted World (King Leung)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28837/hong-kong-fintech-can-drive-green-investment-stability-in-a-disrupted-world
Time Published: 2025-07-07T04:49:33Z
Full Content:
Current disruptions to global trade norms risk pricing out developing nations from critical green technologies and deter related investments. This stalls both decarbonisation and economic growth in regions most reliant on affordable imports. Here, Hong Kong has a unique role to play. According to United Nations Trade and Development, developing economies are already facing challenges navigating trade rules inconsistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change, often missing out on green windows of opportunity. The ongoing global trade conflict has caused jitters within solar industries across several Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. This creates a growing gap in green investment and economic development between developed and developing countries. As a leading international financial centre, Hong Kong is well positioned to channel the RMB 138 trillion needed for China's transition to carbon neutrality by 2050, with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited leading as the largest venue for Chinese offshore green bonds at 46% of total offshore volume. Hong Kong can use its unique position to introduce stability amid disruptions by driving innovation in green finance. One example discussed at the recent 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival in April, was harnessing the tokenisation of real-world assets (RWA). Tokenisation is the process of representing traditional assets like infrastructure projects as digital tokens issued over a blockchain. By fractionalising these assets, tokenisation allows smaller investors to participate in projects that would otherwise be unaffordable. It offers a solution to the challenges posed by reduced investment by improving the efficiency of capital allocation, enabling broader access to investment opportunities. According to Blackrock, by 2040, the global demand for new infrastructure investment is US$68 trillion which includes roads, energy, rail, telecom, water, airport, and ports. According to the Boston Consultancy Group, the total size of illiquid asset tokenisation will grow to US$16 trillion by 2030. For green finance, tokenisation could transform how renewable energy projects are funded. Historically, large-scale renewable energy projects have been funded by institutional investors, but the goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 faces a growing investment shortfall of US$400 billion annually, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Tokenisation opens a new asset class in which an investor could own a fraction of a wind farm in Vietnam or a solar project in Kenya, diversifying their portfolio while contributing to the global energy transition. The transparency of the underpinning blockchain technology also curbs green washing, attracting broader investors. This lowers the barrier to entry for investors while ensuring that capital flows directly to regions where the investment gap is increasing, bypassing traditional bottlenecks in financing. At a time of growing volatility, tokenisation provides a decentralised, transparent mechanism to boost the green energy transition, even as traditional trade and aid channels falter. In this regard, Hong Kong has a set of unique advantages to lead the tokenisation revolution in green finance. From a policy perspective, our city is ahead of its peers, with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) having already laid the groundwork for this transformation. In 2023, with the support of the HKMA, Hong Kong became the first government in the world to issue a tokenised green bond. In 2024, HKMA’s Project Ensemble provided the environment necessary to accelerate innovation, experimentation and adoption of tokenisation in real-world financial sector applications. This led to one local startup launching tokenised private credit for EV charging infrastructure. Not only does this offer private credit instruments for investments in green infrastructure, including secondary market access, it also creates a novel model that can be replicated at scale. The joint SFC and HKMA Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group has also been instrumental in developing the city’s strategy as a leader in sustainable finance. Today, Hong Kong is the world’s second-largest cross-border wealth management hub, with projections suggesting it will overtake Switzerland by 2028. Family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are increasingly turning to alternative assets to mitigate portfolio risks amid volatile markets. This shift is fuelled by surging capital inflows from Mainland China, ASEAN countries, Europe, etc. and recent multi-billion commitments from sovereign funds from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Notably, a Endowus survey found 90% of HNWIs in Asia plan to boost allocations to alternatives, underscoring the city’s pivotal role in redefining global wealth strategies. Hong Kong’s thriving fintech sector is over 1,100 companies strong, with a leading Web3 ecosystem advancing tokenisation. This is amplified by its integration with the Greater Bay Area, ranked second globally for tech innovation, according to the World Intellectual Property Office. This potent combination of progressive policies, original innovation and fintech talent gives the city a unique edge. Perhaps most importantly, Hong Kong can deliver at scale. This is where the world comes to do finance. Our financial hub ranks third globally, first in Asia and fourth worldwide for fintech specifically. Hong Kong has one of the deepest pools of capital in Asia, free flow of capital, as well as being on the doorstep of mainland China, which is leading in areas such as electric vehicles, batteries, solar and more. Tokenisation alone is not the panacea to ensuring equitable access and support for the global green transition. International cooperation and robust policies will be essential for the challenges we face. However, in a world rife with turbulence, Hong Kong can rise to the occasion by leveraging its strengths to foster stability and pave the way for a sustainable future.

Title: Obama Wants the Power to Define ‘Facts’

The Connecticut Forum hosted Barack Obama a few weeks ago to discuss current events, and the former president took the opportunity to support government regulatory constraints for online speech. “We want diversity of opinion. We don’t want diversity of facts,” Obama opined in his nonchalant way of attacking the First Amendment while pretending to support it. “There is a difference between these platforms letting all voices be heard,” he continued, “versus a business model that elevates the most hateful voices, or the most polarizing voices, or the most dangerous in the sense of inciting violence.” Obama has always been a tyrant wearing a smiling celebrity’s mask. Just who shall be empowered to determine the “facts” that will constrain public speech? Barack Obama and his fellow Marxist travelers expect to have that job. Did you know that men can have babies and that women are at risk for prostate cancer? That’s right! Those are “facts”! Did you know that Hamas terrorists who chop off Jewish babies’ heads practice a “religion of peace”? That’s a “fact,” too, and anybody who disagrees is spreading “hate”! Did you know that the Clinton-Obama-Steele Dossier confirmed President Trump’s “collusion” with Russia and that Vladimir Putin now rules from the White House? That’s a “fact”! Disgraced CIA director John Brennan and disgraced FBI director Jim Comey both said so! Did you know that we’re all going to die from global cooling…er, global warming…er, I mean, extreme weather, unless we pay more in taxes and allow powerful corporations and governments to monitor our economic transactions? That’s a scientific “fact,” man! Anybody who disagrees is a “dangerous” idiot! The truth is that if we really followed Obama’s proposed regulatory rule in constraining online speech, most of the nonsense that Democrats and their leftist cohorts around the world believe would be banned as fake science and fake news! It takes a tremendous amount of “diversity of facts” to conclude that strange men should be allowed to share restrooms with little girls and compete in women’s sports. Yet, according to Obama, the delusional should be entitled to determine what is “true,” and the sane should be punished for objecting! Consider delusional leftists’ unhealthy obsession with the weather. “Global warming” is a pseudo-scientific cult religion used to concentrate economic and political power into the hands of a small number of global elites. Earth is worshiped as a goddess. Hydrocarbons are forbidden fruits. And humans who choose natural energy sources, such as oil and gas, over Paleolithic standards of living are condemned as sinners who must repent by handing over their material possessions to the State. The “green energy” scam is bastardized Christianity dressed in Marxism and packaged to ignorant yet self-important lost souls who crave meaning in their lives. It is both fake science and a fake religion for those who are desperate to feel that they are smarter and more virtuous than everyone else. It is a dogma for bullies that provides those who idolize rocks an opportunity to inflict great human suffering while pretending to do the opposite. It is a lie told by elites, swallowed whole by brainwashed minions who know nothing of real science, and used to transfer income and savings from the poorest to the wealthiest. It is a boogeyman story that those with power tell to those without power. It is pure evil. And it is the settled “scientific” consensus of the Democrat Party, European Union bureaucrats, and their corporate allies throughout the West. It makes perfect sense why Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg (now twenty-two years old) became the global face for fighting “climate change.” Economic and political elites always prey on the young when they need to push fanciful and costly public policies. (After all, there’s a reason why politicians send eighteen-year-old boys to cross barbed-wire battlefields saturated with mines and dead bodies: thirty-year-old soldiers have seen enough to know that their governments use them as cannon fodder.) What makes someone as young as Greta an ideal mascot for elites’ shadowy agenda is not her incomplete education or scientific illiteracy; it is her youthful inexperience in recognizing how persistently governments lie. As far as I can tell, Greta believes that man-made “climate change” and capitalism, more generally, are killing the planet. Meanwhile, she doesn’t seem very curious as to why colossal multinational investment firms — including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street — have heavily invested in the World Economic Forum’s “Great Reset,” the U.S.-E.U.’s “Green New Deal,” and so-called “environmental, social, and governance” (ESG) standards of investing. If the biggest players in capitalism and the wealthiest financial dynasties on the planet are all hyping the “climate change” apocalypse, a staunch critic of capitalism with a few functioning neural synapses might wonder why “save the planet” foot soldiers are working for the moneyed elite. Nine times out of ten, innocent useful idiots who do the bidding of Big Business and Big Government simply can’t fathom that powerful interests would advance outrageous lies as the “truth.” Apocalyptic “global warming,” Greta surely tells herself, must be true because if it is not, then global leaders, “scientific” organizations, and countless “philanthropic” groups have conspired to pull the wool over the eyes of the world. The lies that powerful people and institutions spread are so brazen that sometimes painful experience is required to break the spell of popular consensus. Whether that experience is the government’s official narrative regarding President Kennedy’s assassination, the government’s evidence for weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the Iraq War, the government’s assertion that Russia stole the 2016 presidential election from Hillary Clinton, the government’s directed censorship of scientific corroboration that COVID was engineered in a Wuhan laboratory, or the government’s repeated promises that COVID “vaccines” are “safe and effective,” a large number of people require a Eureka! moment before they finally realize that governments and corporations specialize in Big Lies. Until that time, the same people who push endless wars, mass migration, and higher taxes that pay off Big Bank losses wave their rainbow flags and suck fifteen-dollar drinks from paper straws. And too many young, useful idiots play “follow the leader” and believe that “transgenderism” and “global warming” are real. As is true of leftist political parties throughout the West, the Democrat Party in the United States is now just an assortment of foreigners who broke into the country and a menagerie of “woke,” America-hating communists obsessed with their genitals and skin color. The tenets of its professed ideology are contradictory, stale, and stupid. Democrat voters have become the programmable parrots for an elite aristocratic class. They believe and do what they are told and repeat what they hear. If they must support “transgenderism,” “global warming,” or Hamas terrorists to remain in good standing with Barack Obama’s “fact” checkers, they will. To be a member of the modern Democrat Party is to hand your brain over to your master while putting on a cosplay uniform that allows naïve people to playact at being revolutionaries. If Barack Obama and his Marxist legions are allowed to determine the “facts,” then the world will continue its descent toward a future where the delusional rule over the sane. Lying politicians will continue to criminalize free speech. Lying spies from the various large intestines of the Intelligence Community will continue to invent “narratives” that justify war. Lying central bankers will continue to suck up wealth from the middle class while forcing everyone to use paper confetti as currency. Lying “scientists” will continue to promote “climate change” or COVID fearmongering in return for government grant money. Greta Thunberg might even win Nobel Prizes for both peace and chemistry. Only truth can beat back the foolish wickedness of this world. Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0.

Title: Recently vandalized UK warplanes are foreign assets – ex-envoy to RT (VIDEO)
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621063-craig-murray-rt-uk-planes-owned-hedge-fund-paint-attack/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T16:22:47Z
Full Content:
The Royal Air Force warplanes defaced by pro-Palestinian activists last month are owned not by the British government but a US hedge fund, prominent human-rights activist Craig Murray has alleged. He added that at least some of the planes appear to be routinely leased out to the Israeli military. In June, several activists from the group Palestine Action broke into Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, and sprayed red paint into the turbines of two Voyager aircraft before fleeing the scene undetected. The group said the stunt was a protest against the supposed involvement of the Royal Air Force in Israel’s military operation in Gaza. The British authorities vowed to prosecute those responsible. Speaking to RT on Sunday, Murray, who served as British ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 till 2004 and is an associate of WikiLeaks’ co-founder Julian Assange, said that he had discovered that the planes in question were owned by Airtanker Ltd, which, in turn, is supposedly “owned by a string of seven fake companies.” According to Murray, behind the cutout entities stands a US hedge fund named Polygon Global Partners LLP, which is the real owner of the planes. He claimed that the entity “has joint interests with the Trump organization and BlackRock,” which has stakes in several military industrial giants. The former British diplomat told RT that of the 14 planes in question “nine are permanently with the RAF, and five of them are sometimes with the RAF, and sometimes can be leased out to other foreign militaries, including the Israeli military.” “It seems to be fairly definite that the Israelis are using these planes. These planes have been frequently flying to [the RAF Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus] which has been the main military support base for Israeli activities into Gaza,” Murray claimed. He added that officials in London refuse to either confirm or deny that such military missions are carried out in support of Israel. On top of that, according to Murray, the British “taxpayer is being ripped off” as under the contract with Polygon Global, the UK government is “paying five times the value of these planes.” He said the agreement expires in 2049. In the wake of the vandalism, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to designate the activist group as a terrorist organization and ban it.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (IBIT) Just Two Spots Away From Being Firm’s Top Revenue-Generating ETF: Bloomberg Analyst
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/06/blackrocks-bitcoin-exchange-traded-fund-ibit-just-two-spots-away-from-being-firms-top-revenue-generating-etf-bloomberg-analyst/

Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is already generating substantial revenue for the world’s largest asset manager, despite being on the market for less than two years. In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%. As of Thursday’s close, IBIT is trading at $62.19.

Title: New UN report reveals the companies getting rich off Israeli occupation and genocide
URL: https://mondoweiss.net/2025/07/new-un-report-reveals-the-companies-getting-rich-off-israeli-occupation-and-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, issued a seminal report on June 30, titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide.” It focuses on the economic interests benefiting from the current genocide in Gaza. While the report itself names a lot of names, from states to corporations, banks, and universities, Albanese concludes, “the entities named in the present report constitute a fraction of a much deeper structure of corporate involvement, profiteering from and enabling violations and crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.” The report comes on the heels of two other major reports by Albanese last year: the “Anatomy of a Genocide” from March 2024 and the “Genocide as Colonial Erasure” in October 2024. In the latter, Albanese identified how Israel was expanding its genocide from Gaza to the West Bank. Her analysis holds that there are three main elements of Israel’s colonialist takeover: displacement, replacement, and erasure. Genocide is the most extreme form of erasure, but it is a part of the larger eliminationist logic within a broader plan of “colonial erasure.” Given her mandate on territories occupied since 1967, that is where Albanese focuses her analysis. The Israeli occupation since 1967 has had broad economic support, particularly from the corporate world, and these actors have mostly continued that support as Israel has moved to its next stage of colonial erasure: Genocide. The focus of this report is to show how corporations have enabled the displacement, replacement, and erasure of Palestinian life, exposing “the integration of the economies of settler-colonial occupation and genocide.” The report finishes with a stirring call to action. In Albanese’s words, “Commercial endeavours enabling and profiting from the obliteration of innocent people’s lives must cease. Corporate entities must refuse to be complicit in human rights violations and international crimes or be held to account.” A post shared by Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@francesca.albanese.unsr.opt) The economic actors facilitating displacement are mostly companies that are involved with heavy equipment, weapons, and tech surveillance. There is a myriad of actors, directly or through subsidiaries. For example, Caterpillar is a well-known example with its deep collaboration with Israeli weapons manufacturers and military: “For decades, Caterpillar Inc. has provided Israel with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure, through both the United States Foreign Military Financing programme and an exclusive licensee requisitioned by Israeli law into the military. In partnership with companies such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Leonardo DRS, Inc.-owned RADA Electronic Industries, Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, “neutralizing” the territory and killing Palestinians.” This has placed Caterpillar at the center of genocide in Gaza: “Since October 2023, Caterpillar equipment has been documented as being used to carry out mass demolitions – including of homes, mosques and life-sustaining infrastructure – raid hospitals and burying alive wounded Palestinians. In 2025, Caterpillar secured a further multi-million dollar contract with Israel.” But there are many other examples in this industry as well: “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to the destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers. Volvo’s licensee is an OHCHR database-listed company [UN database lists business enterprises that have “directly and indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements”] and together they own Merkavim Transportation Technologies Ltd., which produces armoured buses sold to service colonies. Since at least 2007, Volvo machinery has been used to raze Palestinian areas, including in East Jerusalem and Masafer Yatta. For over a decade, HD Hyundai machinery has been used to demolish Palestinian homes and raze farmland, including olive groves.” And these become tools of genocide: “After October 2023, Israel increased the use of the equipment of those companies in the urban destruction of Gaza, including in flattening Rafah and Jabalia, after which the military obscured their logos.” Military tech surveillance is a big part of the Israeli colonialist displacement regime. Israeli companies such as the NSO Group have built a global market for their surveillance technology, but the report also names several well-known international corporations and outlines their roles in supporting Palestinian displacement. These include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Palantir. Once Israel displaces Palestinians, a wide array of businesses support the consolidation of its control through the creation and maintenance of Israeli colonies: construction, raw materials (often pillaged from occupied territory), agribusiness, tourism, etc. Here, there are also many international actors that facilitate the normalization of Israel’s displacement and theft: “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory. In 2024, this intensified after the administration of colonies moved from the military to the civilian Government and the Ministry of Construction and Housing budget doubled, with $200 million allotted for colony construction. From November 2023 to October 2024, Israel established 57 new colonies and outposts, with Israeli and international companies supplying machinery, raw materials and logistical support”. While the same heavy machinery providers reappear (Caterpillar, HD Hyundai, Volvo), other actors provide raw materials: “The German Heidelberg Materials AG, through its subsidiary Hanson Israel, has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank. In 2018, Hanson Israel won a public tender to supply materials from that quarry for colony construction, and has since nearly exhausted the quarry, prompting ongoing expansion requests.” Transport: “Various companies contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians. The Spanish/Basque Construcciones Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles joined a consortium with a OHCHR database-listed company to maintain and expand the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line and build the new Green Line, at a time when other companies had withdrawn owing to international pressure. These lines include 27 kilometres of new tracks and 50 new stations in the West Bank, connecting colonies with West Jerusalem. Doosan and Volvo excavators and machinery have been used, and Heidelberg’s subsidiary supplied materials for a light-rail bridge.” Real estate: “Real estate companies sell properties in colonies to Israeli and international buyers. The global real estate group, Keller Williams Realty LLC, through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel, has had branches based in the colonies. In March 2024, Keller Williams, through another franchisee, Home in Israel, ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” And then there is “occupation tourism”, which brings in the online services, Booking.com and Airbnb: “Major online travel platforms, used by millions to reserve accommodation, profit from the occupation by selling tourism that sustains the colonies, excludes Palestinians, promotes settler narratives and legitimizes annexation. Booking Holdings Inc. and Airbnb, Inc. list properties and hotel rooms in Israeli colonies. Booking.com has more than doubled its listings in the West Bank – from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023 – and tripled its East Jerusalem listings to 39 in the year post October 2023. Airbnb has also amplified its colonial profiteering, growing from 139 listings in 2016 to 350 in 2025, collecting up to 23 per cent commission. These listings are linked with restricting Palestinian access to land and endangering nearby villages. In Tekoa, Airbnb enables settler promotion of a “warm and loving community”, whitewashing settler violence against the neighbouring Palestinian village of Tuqu‘.” There is an entire interconnected network of companies, institutions, and interests that weave together to support and profit from the Israeli occupation. The entities are all enabling Israel’s illegality, and Albanese breaks them down by sector. War crimes and crimes against humanity are a risky business in general. Investing in a country that creates so much turmoil is counterintuitive for many, and many investors have bailed out of the high-tech industry, for example. That’s why financial giants are important to secure that investments in the war machine keep flowing. Albanese explains how the world’s largest banks give Israel financial cover as it carries out genocide. Albanese: “Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms – including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) – were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them. Meanwhile, the Development Corporation for Israel (i.e., Israel Bonds) provides a bond solicitation service for the Government of Israel for overseas private individuals and other investors. The Development Corporation for Israel tripled its annual bond sales to funnel nearly $5 billion to Israel since October 2023, while offering investors the option of sending the return on bond investments to charitable organizations supporting the Israeli military and the colonies.” Insurance companies then buttress this: “Global insurance companies, including [German] Allianz and AXA, also invest large sums in shares and bonds implicated in the occupation and genocide, partly as capital reserves for policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but primarily to generate returns. Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion and AXA, despite some divestment decisions, still invests at least $4.09 billion in tracked companies named in the present report. Their insurance policies also underwrite the risks other companies necessarily take when operating in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, thus enabling the commission of human rights abuses and “de-risking” the operational environment.” And pension funds are involved in this too, including Norwegian and Canadian ones: “Sovereign wealth and pension funds are also significant financiers. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, claims it has the world’s most comprehensive ethical guidelines. After October 2023, the Fund increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32 per cent to $1.9 billion. By the end of 2024, the Fund had $121.5 billion – 6.9 per cent of its total value – invested in companies named in the present report alone. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages Can$ 473.3 billion ($328.9 billion) in pension funds for six million Canadians, has almost Can$ 9.6 billion ($6.67 billion) invested in companies named in the present report, despite its sustainable investment policy and human rights policy. From 2023 to 2024, it almost tripled investment in Lockheed Martin, quadrupled investment in Caterpillar and increased 10-fold the investment in HD Hyundai.” But the enablers are not just financial institutions. Albanese shows how academia has also played a crucial role. The most prestigious academic institutions are tied to Israel. Like MIT: “Leading universities, especially from global-minority countries, partner with Israeli institutions in areas directly harming Palestinians. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labs conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense – the only foreign military financing research at the Institute. Notable Israeli Ministry of Defense projects include drone swarm control – a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 – pursuit algorithms and underwater surveillance. From 2019 to 2024, the Institute managed a Lockheed Martin seed fund connecting students to teams in Israel. From 2017 to 2025, Elbit Systems paid for membership to the Institute’s Industrial Liaison Program, enabling access to research and talent.” Huge EU academic projects are involved: “The European Commission’s Horizon Europe programme actively facilitates collaboration with Israeli institutions, including those complicit in apartheid and genocide. Since 2014, the European Commission has granted over €2.12 billion ($2.4 billion) to Israeli entities, including the Ministry of Defense, while European academic institutions both benefit from and reinforce this entanglement. The Technical University of Munich receives €198.5 million ($218 million) in EC Horizon funding, including €11.47 million ($12.6 million) for 22 collaborations with Israeli partners, military and tech firms. The University and Israel Aerospace Industries receive €792,795.75 ($868,416) to jointly develop, with other participants, green hydrogen refuelling, technology relevant to Israel Aerospace Industries military drones used in Gaza. The University partners with IBM Israel – which runs the discriminatory Israeli Population Registry – on cloud and artificial intelligence systems, as part of the €7.75 million ($8.52 million) IBM Israel receives in Horizon funding. The University also collaborates on a €10.76 million ($11.71 million) project on “seamless shared urban mobility” that includes the Municipality of Jerusalem, a city entrenching annexation through urban transportation.” Agribusiness has often been seen as a trademark of Israel’s innovation, but it is inextricably connected to Israel’s occupation. “Agribusiness has thrived on Israel-led extractivism and land-grabbing – producing goods and technologies serving Israeli settler-colonial interests, expanding market dominance and attracting global investment – while erasing Palestinian food systems and accelerating displacement,” Albanese writes. She names the Israeli food giant Tnuva, and the watering giant Netafim: “Tnuva, the largest food conglomerate in Israel, now majority-owned by the Chinese Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd., has fueled and benefited from land dispossession. Tnuva’s Chairman recognized that “agriculture … in general and dairy farming in particular are a strategic resource and a significant pillar in the settlement enterprise”. Israel has used kibbutzim and agricultural outposts to seize Palestinian land and replace Palestinians. Companies like Tnuva help by sourcing products from these colonies, then exploit the resulting captive Palestinian market to build market dominance… Netafim, a global leader in drip irrigation technology, now 80 per cent owned by the Mexican company Orbia Advance Corporation, has designed its agritech in concert with the expansion imperatives of Israel. While maintaining a global image of sustainability, Netafim technology has enabled intensive exploitation of water and land in the West Bank, further depleting Palestinian natural resources, while being refined through collaboration with Israeli military-technology firms. In the Jordan Valley, Netafim-aided irrigation systems have facilitated Israeli crop expansion, while Palestinian farmers – denied water and with 93 per cent unirrigated land – are pushed out, unable to compete with Israeli production. Furthermore, such irrigation techniques threaten to exhaust the Jordan River and Dead Sea.” Shipping giants like the Danish Mærsk then ship the goods: “Global logistics giants like A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S are integral to this ecosystem; for years they have shipped goods from the colonies and OHCHR database-listed companies straight to the United States and other markets.” And Mærsk is involved in much more than just shipping avocados: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” Those who supply Israel with energy, inevitably supply what Israel is doing – not just its colonization, but also its genocide. A lot of world actors are involved here: “Coal for electricity to Israel originates primarily from Colombia (60 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023-24); United States-headquartered Drummond Company, Inc. and the Swiss-based Glencore PLC are the primary suppliers. Their respective subsidiaries own the mines and the three ports involved in the delivery of 15 coal shipments to Israel since October 2023, including six shipments after Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel in August 2024. Glencore was also involved in shipments from South Africa; these shipments accounted for 15 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023 and 2024.” This is taking place while Israel pillages Palestinian natural resources: “The United States Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMed Energy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan. The Gaza naval blockade is connected to Israel securing the Tamar gas supply and the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline. At a time of increasing brutality, the British company BP PLC is expanding involvement in the Israeli economy, with exploration licences confirmed in March 2025, which allow BP to explore Palestinian maritime expanses illegally exploited by Israel.” While all these sectors of industry help contribute to and enable the Israeli occupation in one way or another, it cannot be forgotten that the Israeli military and weapons industry are a primary vehicle for and beneficiary of Israel’s military aggression and genocide. Albanese naturally has a section focused on the military sector, titled “Military sector – the business of elimination,” which shows how its military industry serves a major national and international economic interest. Albanese explains: “The military-industrial complex has become the economic backbone of the State. Between 2020 and 2024, Israel was the eighth-largest arms exporter worldwide. The two most prominent Israeli weapons companies – Elbit Systems, established as a public-private partnership and later privatized, and State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries – are among the top 50 arms manufacturers globally.” And there’s the cooperation with the U.S., which has culminated in the F-35 jet program, a massive international effort: “Israel benefits from the largest-ever defence procurement programme – for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin, alongside at least 1,650 other companies, including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A, and eight States… Post-October 2023, F-35s and F-16s have been integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” There are also the Elbit drones, which is also the product of international collaboration: “Suppliers such as the Japanese FANUC Corporation provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin”. And shipping, of course, so once again Mærsk: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” So while there is the raw military industry, which people obviously associate with the worst of the attacks against Palestinians – but there is so much more to Israel’s apparatus of control over Palestine and Palestinians. It is so enormous and so globally interconnected that it would be hard to find a person in this world who doesn’t know at least one of the corporations involved. Albanese concludes with her recommendations for states, corporations, the ICC, and the UN. For corporations, this is to “cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international crimes against the Palestinian people” and to pay reparations to the Palestinian people. She offers the example of an apartheid wealth tax along the lines of post-apartheid South Africa. For states and international bodies, such as the ICC and UN, Albanese calls on them to enforce the accountability mechanisms at their disposal, not only on Israel, but on the corporations who are enabling its illegal action. In addition, she called on states to impose sanctions and a full arms embargo on Israel. And then finally, she has a call to action for us in civil society: “The Special Rapporteur urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can end these unspeakable crimes.” Albanese outlines a worldwide network of collaboration that enables Israel’s genocide in one way or another. It is overwhelming to consider, and some may be daunted by its enormity, but it is not an invincible system. It operates on elements that are very mundane: resources and money. It is dependent on an economic network and on global consent. And here lies the key to dismantling it. Albanese ends: “The complicity exposed by the report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives. International law recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has allowed it.” Jonathan Ofir Jonathan Ofir is an Israeli musician, conductor and writer based in Denmark. You can hear it directly from Francesca Albanese in this 13 minute interview with Chris Hedges: “...the genocide in gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative…” “The Real Reason the Genocide Hasn’t Been Stopped” https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/06/the-real-reason-the-genocide-hasnt-been-stopped-w-francesca-albanese/ And there’s also another reason the genocide has been allowed to continue: the U.S. military is testing the waters to see what the public will tolerate: In the past several years, the Department of Defense has become fixated on how the United States might fight a major war against an enemy that rivals the American military in force and technology. In such a scenario—known as a large-scale combat operation, or L.S.C.O.—combat would take place across land, sea, air, and into the thermosphere. Command of the air could not be taken for granted. Intelligence may be spotty. Casualties could soar into the hundreds of thousands, and whole cities could be flattened. “In short,” Modirzadeh writes, the U.S. military has begun “preparing for an all-out war with China.” And, with such conflagrations burning in the mind, “LSCO lawyers,” as Modirzadeh calls them, have been arguing that the laws of war are far more permissive than many of their peers and the public seem to appreciate. From that vantage, Gaza not only looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat U.S. soldiers may face. It is a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entail. “What’s Legally Allowed in War…How U.S. military lawyers see Israel’s invasion of Gaza—and the public’s reaction to it—as a dress rehearsal for a potential conflict with a foreign power like China.” https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/whats-legally-allowed-in-war Each of those businesses employs workers, all of whom are complicit in the Israeli genocide. They know that the results of their well-paid, comfortable careers in arms manufacture here in the UK, in the USA and in Europe are injured and dead children. It would be interesting to hear their excuses. If the weapons they made were being directed at their own children would they still go to work?

As then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano revealed in March 2018, the association’s penetration of Tehran was unprecedented. At a press conference, Amano referred to the IAEA’s nuclear “verification regime” in Iran as “the world’s most robust.” The organization’s inspectors spent “3,000 calendar days per year on the ground” in the country, capturing “hundreds of thousands of images captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras,” which was “about half of the total number of such images that we collect throughout the world.” In all, “over one million pieces of open source information” were collected by the IAEA monthly. The IAEA’s fixation on Iran, coupled with suspicions that it provided the names of nuclear scientists – later assassinated by Israel – raises the question: Was the 2015 deal always an industrial-scale espionage operation designed to prepare for war? A wave of assassinations of nuclear scientists and IRGC commanders in the early stages of Tel Aviv’s failed war on Iran appears to support that conclusion. Iranian officials not only suspended cooperation with the IAEA and ordered the dismantlement of inspection cameras, but also rejected Grossi’s request to visit bombed nuclear sites. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi branded the IAEA chief’s insistence on visiting under the pretext of safeguards “meaningless and possibly even malign in intent.” What is clear is that any state still cooperating with the IAEA must now reckon with the possibility that it is not being monitored – it is being mapped for war.

And that doesn’t begin to cover the contradictory “college trained outsider artists,” audiences obsessed with the idea of mental illness and creativity, or the straight-up derivative nature of the work — not just Mr. Doodle but the numerous artists working in this ‘all-over’ high-contrast style, indistinguishable from each other (unless maybe you care to learn their individual preferred iconography). Living in Brooklyn there were multiple artists using this style and winning public-art / mural commissions. Someone wisely said to me “don’t ever harsh on another artist’s hustle,” which is good advice, since it’s a shit career if you don’t have either inherited or ‘partner’ family money. But damn, I don’t know where the satisfaction comes in with this hustle for the artists. At its core the work itself is entirely forgettable once the viewer gets past the ‘wow’ factor of x-space being covered by patterns. Agree. In the above childishness though I would guess it really is merely an (art) performance only (any financial incentive known?), blending profession and private life into one for a limited period (is this his real and only home or is it truly just a performative art space?) – just like so-called star movie actors who cannot step outside of their homes any more – accepting however that a state of loss of privacy is guaranteeing their income. Quid pro quo. If the doodles had been done as fractals. That would have been awesome. It’s so very derivative of Keith Haring but without the soul and the radical left and gay politics. It makes me ill that this is what people want. Add the Ukrainian bride to the equation and I’m nearly ready to off myself, as an artist who put it somewhere aside in order to make a living as a lawyer (sigh). During my year in art school I became increasingly put off by the fine arts scene to the point where my end-of-year essay was titled “From Post-Modernism to Post-Relevancy: The Current Era of Art” and was basically just a diatribe of the insular elitist culture that had no connection to society outside their small circles nor interest in any art that did resonate with regular people. After dropping out I moved to NYC and my first job was at a restaurant where the owner was close friends with Mark Kostabi and had his art all over the walls. His cold appropriation of the Warhol factory system was about as vapid and exploitive as a third world garment factory. He would even have his “assistants” do napkin doodles which he would then sign. Also catered another “pop” artist’s gallery show which was attended by Donald and Marla Maples. The gaudy affair cemented my distain for the fine art scene. The type of art they celebrate and the crowds that flock to it are the last ones who should be doing so. And, as has been discussed here before, it’s primarily just a money laundering racket anyway. This is why I actually love the “banana duct-taped to a wall”. It’s one of the only works of art in recent times that spoke to regular people and clearly expressed much of what is wrong with this industry. The fine arts collapse into irrelevancy really was the canary in the coal mine for culture in general. Elites glad-handing each other over derivative meaningless slop at decadent celeb-idolizing affairs where untold wealth is garnered while completely insulated from the lives, ideas, and culture of the rest of humanity. This insulation is like inbreeding and each generation of art degenerates. As you said, this doodle art has fragments of Haring DNA but minus any of the qualities that made his work vibrant and alive. Its posh hotel room art. The documentary “Exit Through The Gift Shop” best expresses it in showing how a guy used money, celebs, and PR to become and overnight artworld hotshot named Mr Brainwash. This welcoming of “popular” art is evident at all levels of the “art market.” Case in point being the time I helped Phyllis run a tent at a regional arts and crafts fair in Southern Mississippi. It was somewhat inland, but close enough to the Gulf Coast to attract quite a lot of that crowd. Over a three-day weekend, a holiday no less, Phyl sold exactly no works; which included watercolours, hand-made jewelry, and fall themed wreaths, made from dried flowers, and similar ingredients. The wreaths were particularly good. Phyl has an eye for colour and form. In the tent behind us was a group selling gaudy, tinsel, foil, and christmas tree light, (the tiny variety,) wreaths. All these objects did not have were tiny elves singing “O Holy Night” in Chipmunk voices. They charged pretty high prices. They sold a lot of their stock, because, as one of the women running the booth told me; “These styles are all the rage right now. You know, popular in the womens magazines and all.” So, despair not, the Alchemist’s Creed is alive and well in America. As Above, So Below. Stay safe. Luck with your calling. Very true. It’s not easy for substantive art to stand out next to shiny objects. Like with anything (food, books, fashion, etc) most have their tastes defined by convenience, novelty, and consensus. We often claim we are tired of the same ol’ same but lack the willingness to seek out experiences which may challenge and even disappoint us. Or worse yet, others might judge us negatively for liking! I appreciate your kind words of encouragement. I try to not let my pessimism derail my focus on trying to make art that might matter to regular people. As a good friend who has been very successful making real art once told me: “That which takes time, time will respect.” (He heard that quote elsewhere and didn’t remember who said it). Did someone say gift shop? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7VChN-jKc The cat olympics video is generated by AI (as its title indicates). The $387M penthouse may be a real one, but it also looks as something that could be generated by AI. Or to put it in another way: architectural slop by real architects serves to train AI so that it can produce more architectural slop in turn. I am not sure I could even find aged Wagyu beef where I live, but that meat seems to me to be marbled with a real lot of fat? And one should pay over $7000 per kg for that? Something escapes me. Viewing the cat olympics video is an experience similar to viewing a boring cartoon. Waste of time. Ugly slab of meat? Space age penthouse? Ooooosie. More waste of time. NC, do better. It would be a benefit if sites could moderate and not post AI, especially videos. Imagine in a year or so it could be a true benefit to readership claiming that “no AI videos are posted on our site”, essentially, an “organic blog”. Bon courage NC. AI is not allowed and I am ripping out the cat Olympics. TYVM! In defense of the site; have you seen some of the real trash floating around the webs lately? Mr. Doodle is sane in comparison. I was maybe going to suggest that reading the articles is more thought provoking than just driving by and looking at the pictures. Also it’s good to know whats out there, how to spot ai crap, what lengths rich morons will go to to justify or trumpet their untouchability, and the animal kingdom antidotes, well if you read the articles generally speaking, and this considering the sorry state of our little rock hurtling unspecified through space, you need the animal kingdom antidotes just to decompress a little. Agreed. The sea otter video was a wonderful anecdote to the dire articles today and a perfect reminder of why it all matters. … reading the articles is more thought provoking than just driving by and looking at the pictures. That was the excuse for everyone having a Playboy magazine back in the day. :) No, it was for the stereo ads. It’s just a Sunday Supplement chronicle. It is interesting (and rather saddening) to compare the high-diving cats with the high-diving giraffes that I first discovered here on NC maybe 10 years ago?? My grandkids still ask to watch this. I think the main difference is that the high-diving giraffe video tells a little story. It’s not a very advanced story, but it’s cute. AI has a very hard time telling stories because of the lack of object permanence and inability to take detailed instructions (because it’s just statistical generation). David Gerard covered it recently at Pivot-to-AI, with rather funny examples of what happens if you try to generate famous (serious) scenes. If you just try to get the AI to tel the story, yes it won’t get you there. But people are now starting to make coherent short films with it, but it requires some film-making skills and some actual work. The character consistency issue is mostly solved, but there is still work to do. It will be a non-issue in a few months. Well I don’t mind the occasional ‘daily antitoxin’ post to keep me aware of what the scams literally looks like. This was definitely dreck. When the dive turns into that cartoon blur, it lost me completely. They couldn’t even make it up to the uncanny valley. Fatty beef ala prime rib roasts and rib eye steaks can be very delicious, the fat marbling is the key to good meat with those cuts. As for Waygu, like most luxury goods, it is not worth the upgrade. I’ve tasted Waygu (not at that kind of price), it is good but not so much better than prime rib that I would try it again. There is a farmer around here who uses Japanese methods to produce Waygu-like beef, people say it is delicious and while not as expensive as Japanese Waygu, it is pricey and I don’t see a reason to try it. My mother grew up on a dairy farm. She would always trim the fat she served us as children. Then she would eat the trimmings herself. She lived to 99 and was never fat herself. Of course, back in the day, local livestock ate very little, if any lipophilic agricultural toxins … Fat is flavor, according to people all over the world. Yum! It also satiates so a kind of dietish food reducing cravings for carbohydrates. YMMV “Fat is flavor” is yet another empty slogan Internet influencers use to entertain hoi polloi. It’s all about catchphrases. Iberico pork otoh, so so worth it. The penthouse is real. According to Google image search, it is located in the Odeon Tower in Monaco. Yes, it exists! And for anyone in the commentariat with 387m clams lying around with nothing to do, here is a handy link: https://www.thepinnaclelist.com/properties/tour-odeon-tower-sky-penthouse-principality-monaco/ I’m sure the 387m is just a highball asking price (a la Trump); they’ll probably settle for 350m. I always enjoy haggling at Tuscany’s outdoor antique markets (admittedly for drastically lower amounts). Is it my imagination, or does that $387M penthouse look like it has a giant toilet in the front? Flush the oligarchs! re: Gaza / James Baldwin machine-translation from German daily JUNGE WELT Historical reflections James Baldwin recognized parallels between the situation of Black people in the USA and the situation of Palestinians in Israel By Jürgen Heiser https://archive.is/bxvOJ `For this reason, Baldwin largely dealt with the relations between Blacks and Jews in “The Harlem Ghetto,” criticizing not only their political but also their spiritual leaders. In religious terms, Baldwin argued, African Americans identified with the Hebrews of the Old Testament: “It is the Old Testament that is most often clung to and preached from. It provides the emotional fire and dissects the pain of slavery.” But for African Americans, this very identification with the ancient Hebrews became a source of bitterness. Jewish businessmen in Harlem were complicit in the white exploitation of Blacks. They were therefore “also identified with the oppression and hated for it.” (…) In contrast, Black people in the United States identified almost entirely with the fate of the Jews. The most devout among them felt like Jews themselves and waited for Moses to lead them out of Egypt: “As Israel was chosen, so they also consider themselves chosen. The images of the suffering Christ and the suffering Jew are combined with the image of the suffering slave, and they are one: The people who walked in darkness saw a brilliant light!” (…) In the controversial essay “Open Letter to the Born Again,” published in The Nation on September 29, 1979,² Baldwin concluded: “The State of Israel was not created to save the Jews, but to save Western interests. This is now becoming clear (I must say it was always clear to me). The Palestinians have been paying a high price for more than 30 years for the British colonial policy of ‘divide and rule’ and for Europe’s guilty Christian conscience.” Baldwin had been concerned with the Palestinian conflict since the early 1960s, but his views changed radically over time. In his earlier essays, he rarely mentioned the Palestinians. Later, however, Baldwin adopted an increasingly critical stance toward Israeli policies, and his solidarity with the Palestinian liberation struggle grew. In 2024, journalist Alexander Durie, writing in the US online magazine Literary Hub on the occasion of Baldwin’s 100th birthday, referred to the Palestinian scholar Nadia Alahmed.³ The activist works as an assistant professor of African and Middle Eastern Studies at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Durie pointed out to him that after Baldwin changed his mind about Israel, he consistently criticized Tel Aviv’s policies: “Baldwin was one of the first significant Black American voices to recognize the State of Israel for what it truly is.”´ I’ll give Baldwin the nod to being very early to write about the reality of Israel and Palestine. But I think many people have long recognized the state of Israel for what it truly is and as is often said around here, their financial interests mean they must ignore that reality. With reference to America, but applicable to beneficiaries of imperialism everywhere: “But for power truly to feel itself menaced, it must somehow sense itself in the presence of another power—or, more accurately, an energy—which it has not known how to define and therefore does not really know how to control. For a very long time, for example, America prospered—or seemed to prosper: this prosperity cost millions of people their lives. Now, not even the people who are the most spectacular recipients of the benefits of this prosperity are able to endure these benefits: they can neither understand them nor do without them, nor can they go beyond them. Above all, they cannot, or dare not, assess or imagine the price paid by their victims, or subjects, for this way of life, and so they cannot afford to know why the victims are revolting. They are forced, then, to the conclusion that the victims—the barbarians—are revolting against all established civilized values—which is both true and not true—and, in order to preserve these values, however stifling and joyless these values have caused their lives to be, the bulk of the people desperately seek out representatives who are prepared to make up in cruelty what both they and the people lack in conviction. This is a formula for a nation’s or a kingdom’s decline, for no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone.” ― James Baldwin, No Name in the Street (circa 1972) More evidence of Trump’s bad character (vengefulness) courtesy of Steven A. Smith: (Not that we need any more, but the anecdote is telling, IMO) Big, beautiful bill dumped effort to tighten tax laws for NFL owners By Mike Florio Published July 5, 2025 01:58 PM When the big, beautiful bill left the House for the Senate, it contained a provision that would have created anything but a tax cut for the mega-wealthy. By the time the final bill was signed into law, the provision that would have harmed sports owners was not included. We’re told that the Senate’s version eliminated the wrinkle that would have removed the ability of sports-league owners to write off the entire value of “intangible assets” (like player contracts and media-rights deals) over 15 years, and that the House did not reinsert it. The change would have reduced the ability to write off intangible assets from 100 percent to 50 percent. As previously explained by the New York Times, the tax break can equate to “hundreds of millions of dollars,” because intangible assets “make up the bulk of a team’s worth.” The Times reported that some owners believe the change to the tax laws “feels punitive,” with President Trump seeking leverage over NFL owners. “The president is committed to ensuring that sports teams overcharging ticketholders do not receive favorable tax treatment,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields told the Times in a statement issued in late May. “His focus is on fairness for fans, not team ownership.” Why would the President want to stick it to NFL owners? Consider what Stephen A. Smith said last month on The Daily Show. “In 2014, he wanted to purchase the NFL’s Buffalo Bills,” Smith told Jon Stewart on June 9. “The price tag was $1.4 billion. . . . My sources tell me he had $1.1 [billion]. . . . He literally called me in 2014 and he said, ‘Stephen, I’m going to tell you this right now’ — and this is a quote — ‘if them (expletive deleted) get in my way, I’m gonna get them all back. I’m gonna run for president.’ Those are his exact words.” https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/big-beautiful-bill-dumped-effort-to-tighten-tax-laws-for-nfl-owners Trump’s dalliances with pro American football date back to the New Jersey Generals, his USFL franchise that featured Herschel Walker, Doug Flutie and coached by Jim Mora. I’ll have to fact check the player profiles and league dates but eventually it was Trump that insisted on challenging the NFL, 800 lb gorilla back then in court, circa the middle 80s. There were some hilarious high jinks from league players back then, rushing to cash their paycheck, that anecdote came from a different team in the league… The move into court just boded ill fated news for the fledgling spring football league, and a fatal blow to the USFL as a league. Back to the topic on tax laws, I’m sure no Senator or Congress rep would stoop so low as to do the bidding of influential billionaire class or team owners… meanwhile the poor must gladly enjoy taking their bowl of mush ala per Dickensian imagery. As a Bills fan, I should probably say a prayer of thanks every day that Trump did not end up owning the Bills. The NFL owners are notoriously a tight-knit and snobby club, and probably correctly sensed that letting Trump into their circle would be an epically bad idea. Like allowing a street prostitute to hang out with them. Can you imagine? Trump would be firing Bills players and hiring others based on his extensive knowledge of the game, there would be shouting matches with the individual players wrecking team play, he would be getting into fights with other NFL owner while trying to poach their players with his money and his strategy would change on a day by day basis. Yeah, that was one big bullet dodge that. Trump would surely not be a “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Here are some big, beautiful Bills: Josh Allen, Bruce Smith, and Dion Dawkins (6’4, 320 lbs.) Exhibit #1, Carolina Panthers team owner David Tepper Exhibit #2, New York Jets team owner Woody Johnson. Maybe with the coming fall, hope renews for these forlorn team fan bases; but even the hard core devotees really ought to question that investment of time. Being in the coterie of 30 or so wealthy team owners just might mean, that a select handful of these billionaires are comfortable at setting their own franchise investment into a roaring dumpster fire of roadside theater. Not on my list is the LV Raiders, whereby majority team owner Marc Davis is paying former employees after a consistent failure at hiring a head coach or related coaching staff… Counterpoint: if he’d been allowed to buy the Bills, maybe the rest of the world would’ve been spared from his political aspirations. It’s hard to imagine that Trump could be worse than the Haslams, e.g. Johnny Manziel and DeShaun Watson. The Hunts are a-hole billionaires always looking to grab taxpayer money, but they do stay out of running the team. Caligula comes to mind. Even ordering expensive shick and awe against a site buried un a couple hundred meters of granite. Like going to war with Neptune. Chic and awe sounds like Melania Trump’s fashion collection. :) “Elon Musk floats strategy for new political party” I would imagine that his strategy is to try to build up a party to challenge Trump and the Republicans. And when the latter return all those subsidies for EVs such as Teslas to make him go away, he will dissolve that party and tell all the people that followed him to vote for Trump’s Republicans. Will people forget that this was the guy put in charge of taking a wrecking ball to the machinery of Federal government whose effects we are seeing in Texas right now? While USAF is cancelling SPACEX to give the business back to the vendors that lost it to SPACEX. Would one of those vendors be Boeing? :) Serial failures in AF orbital launch are from a number Boeing, General Dynamics, an entity called United Launch Associate (ULA)… the line of vendors is ample for “protected” competitions between incompetents. In 1972 a NCO told me “no one ever lost money selling to Uncle Sam”. I have observed no reason to dispute that claim. Another $150B for competitions of incompetence! I imagine Musk has too many enemies to get anywhere. My memory is hazy, but did Trump do much for the 2022 cycle? This is where I can see pressure being brought. The Koch Brothers wielded power because they gave early and often, mostly early. With budget cuts, I can see the GOP elected getting antsy. Musk seems to be following the philosophy of George W. Bush: If two wrongs don’t make a right, maybe we need three or four instead! And heaven knows with only two billionaire parties, the market is far from saturated… re: COVID THEORY & CONCEPT Int. J. Public Health, 30 May 2025 Volume 70 – 2025 | https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2025.1607727 What Lessons can Be Learned From the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic? https://www.ssph-journal.org/journals/international-journal-of-public-health/articles/10.3389/ijph.2025.1607727/full During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023), governments around the world implemented an unprecedented array of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. From early 2021, these were accompanied by major population-wide COVID-19 vaccination programmes–often using novel mRNA/DNA technology, although some countries used traditional vaccines. Both the NPIs and the vaccine programmes were apparently justified by highly concerning model projections of how the pandemic could progress in their absence. Efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation during the pandemic meant that differing scientific opinions on each of these aspects inevitably received unequal weighting. In this perspective review, based on an international multi-disciplinary collaboration, we identify major problems with many aspects of these COVID-19 policies as they were implemented. We show how this resulted in adverse impacts for public health, society, and scientific progress. Therefore, we propose seven recommendations to reduce such adverse consequences in the future. Nice link, thank you. On aspect of the failure of the COVID response is that CDC is still recommending the vaccines. It is prudent to review past problems but it’s worth our while to keep an eye on current mistakes ~ mistakes that are ongoing. Dr. Philip McMillan has been keeping an eye on this for quite a while. In a recent video (20 minutes), he informs us that Taiwan has shortened the gap between boosters to two months. In a CDC publication in October, 2024, they are discussing dosing every 2 months. By following CDC’s trajectory of “recommendations” he posits “when will it be, every month, every 2 weeks??” Can you imagine taking a measles vax every 2 months? Immune disfunction anyone? These people are morons Although the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was somewhat unseasonal (beginning in Northern Hemisphere spring) and cases were identified in summer periods, it is now apparent that there was a significant seasonal component to the dynamic of the pandemic (especially after accounting for changes in testing capacity). Other human coronaviruses in the same family as SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a strong seasonality in their incidence–reaching a sharp peak in mid-winter and having a very low incidence during the summer [82, 85–87]. Therefore, several studies suggested early on that this seasonality in coronavirus incidence might also influence the pandemic dynamics [82, 85–91]. Others disagreed and argued that SARS-CoV-2 should not be treated like other “seasonal” infections, because seasonality could not be (solely) used to characterise the early pandemic progression, e.g., outbreaks during summer and spring periods [4, 92–95]. Nonetheless, while these points rule out seasonality as the sole factor, most mid-to-high-latitude countries experienced major SARS-CoV-2 waves during the winter months and marked reductions during summer months, suggesting that seasonality is at least a contributing factor [88, 96–99]. That’s just not true; SARS-CoV-2 is not seasonal. And we have over 5 years of data to demonstrate this now. Granted they might have a very peculiar definition of “seasonal”, but out in the real world, if you can get infected year round, and you get additional albeit smaller waves at other times of the year in addition to a large “seasonal” wave, that’s not seasonal. They also believe GBD was a serious call for an alternative approach to NPIs, however flawed their rollout and enforcement may have been, and there’s nothing about GBD that can or should be taken seriously. In late 2020, three prominent epidemiologists wrote the Great Barrington Declaration (https://gbdeclaration.org/), advocating for a more “focused protection” strategy that prioritised the most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly the elderly [176], rather than the diffuse strategies of population-wide NPIs that they were “gravely concerned” were leading to “damaging physical and mental health impacts”. At the time of writing, the declaration has had 941,261 signatories including 16,176 medical and public-health scientists and 47,839 medical practitioners. Yet, rather than leading to a public discussion over whether alternative strategies could be adopted, the declaration was immediately dismissed as allegedly promoting “potentially dangerous fallacies” [102]. Behind the scenes, the then-director of the National Institutes of Health apparently tried to organise “a quick and devastating published take down of its premises” because it “seems to be getting a lot of attention” [177]. The only consolation in any of this is the virus treats everyone the same, and these authors won’t be spared its effects either. The history of the ongoing Pandemic is very much being written by people that are stupid, malicious, or both. They use signatories as a sign of weight, and we know some were literally faked: Herd immunity letter signed by fake experts including ‘Dr Johnny Bananas’ ndividual academics from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Stanford, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Exeter, Sussex and York were among experts from around the world who signed the declaration. However, the declaration’s website allows anyone to add their name to the list if they provide an email address, home city, postcode and name. Signatories also tell the site whether they are medical and public health scientists, medical practitioners or members of the general public – of whom almost 160,000 claim to have signed. I can go on and on. The authors are perpetuating a manifest evil. Thanks for this.

David Lynch’s Cannes Diary, a ten-part series of short missives documenting his experience as jury president in 2002, is primarily a vehicle for him to indulge his love of café au lait, pain au chocolat, baguette avec fromage and vin rouge. He praises the French as ‘the greatest lovers of art and protectors of art in the world’ and looks on everything with childish wonder. That wonder extends to the theatres, where audiences clap and cheer at the tacky festival animation, in which the red staircase floats up into the sky. In Lynch’s words: ‘Everybody knows about carpet. And everybody knows the colour red. So you put those two things together and you get red carpet. But there’s nothing like the red carpet at Cannes.’ Was this Cannes as good as bad sex? Bad sex is usually short. At Cannes, screenings run from 8.30 a.m. to past midnight. If you are a programmer or distributor, it’s typical to watch as many as six films a day. Members of the press rush off to file their reviews or record their podcast ‘takes’. Tickets are released at 7 a.m., four days before each screening, and disappear in seconds. It’s common for screenings to be illuminated by dots of light, as people try to book one film while watching another. (…)” After attending Cannes, a friend who used to work as a film distributor told me that she watched 70 films in one week. I asked: “How did you manage that?” She: “Easy. I watch the first 15 minutes and decide if we might buy the film. If not, I walk out and go watch another one.” Yep. It´s déformation professionelle. In my youth I watched around 5/day in one week of festival, i.e. watch completely. It did give you a decent understanding and overview of what was happening in the art form. I do not know how I would operate today if I had to for job reasons. A certain level of cynicism comes with the job, with the routine. Which is no excuse. And I know people who do it the “proper” way even after 40 years. If you really want to appreciate you can´t walk out. Especially if it is NOT standard fare. You never know what happens in such movies eventually. Of course the medium, the times have changed too. Musk, Bannon, Trump feud– Remember billionaires wanting to seastead? It was a cross between Galt’s Gulch and Elysium. We should expel them and their hangers-on to such a place while confiscating their wealth for the use of the 99.99%. I give it 12 months before they all killed each other, and what a shame that would be. I found the Chinese language video fascinating, particularly in how it highlights the influence of Western thinking on the development of the language. It is interesting how there is not wide spread agreement about words. It got me thinking about the limitations of traditional linguistic approaches. As I often joke, linguists could benefit from putting Noam Chomsky aside for a while and delving into the study of AI instead. Love it or hate it, AI has yielded some intriguing insights that warrant attention from linguists. For instance, Word2Vec – a foundational technique underlying GPT models – embeds words (and now tokens) into high-dimensional space, revealing fascinating structural patterns. The vector between two points in this space often conveys meaningful relationships, such as the equivalent direction and magnitude of the ‘dad’ to ‘son’ vector versus the ‘mom’ to ‘daughter’ vector. Moreover, the remarkable ability of these models to translate between vastly different languages with minimal training suggests that there may be more universal, underlying principles at play in language than we currently appreciate. In fact, some researchers are even using these tools to interpret animal languages, which raises compelling questions about the fundamental nature of communication and cognition. Perhaps it’s time for linguists to explore the intersection of AI and language more deeply, as it may hold the key to unlocking new insights into the intricacies of human language and its relationship to the natural world. Putting the shoe on the other foot, I have been reading essays by the Russian linguist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975), and it is interesting to evaluate human experiences with LLMs through the lens of his ideas. Back in the day, some linguists did, in fact, inform the development of LLMs (at one point ca. 1990, the CIA offered to “fund my laboratory”, but I of course refused). That line of research eventually led to Google search, and thence to LLMs. But as Fred Jelinek famously quipped “Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up”. That’s a nice quote. I need to use it when I speak at a conference at some point in time. I’m seeing a number of what I think of as sorting problems where AI finds useful deep patterns. It takes substantial expertise to benefit from this and it appears, in addition to energy problems, at least the western roll out of Gen AI is mitigating reproduction of expertise. If you think of it as a massively parallel quicksort on vector products, I don’t think you’re far off the mark. Some things considered as part of AI used to be known as multidimensional optimization algorithms. The sea otter clip has been on NC before and IIRC was previously under suspicion for being faked, either with AI or as a compilation of clips of different sea otter encounters. Sorry to be a downer…. Where is the over-priced penthouse, though? At those prices. Monaco or Hong Kong but it looks like the third world from its surroundings…. I appreciate your nose for fakery, Revenant. Whether contrived or not, that clip is a cheap appeal to sentiment. Aren’t we humans wonderful, compassionate creatures, and look how animals appreciate us! Some of the animal videos are wonderful and even wondrous. Too bad that we have to pick our way so carefully to single them out. Even if it is fake there are lots of good people who do bring aid to animals in need. And sometimes a little positive sentimentality can be helpful. Humanity as a whole could stand to “fake it ‘til they make it” with regard to compassion. It belongs to a genre of animals coming to people for help, with spliced together scenes of unrelated animal video. I liked one of these on YouTube and was then deluged. In this case, there were river otters and then sea otters involved, and they are different. One of the clips was taken from my home waters of Morro Bay where we have a very visible colony of sea otters. I’ve heard about the subgenre where people put animal in problem in order to come and save it. Anything for views, and no one can prove wrongdoing. The Rs have about 36% of the electorate and D’s the same. Neither is a majority party. Both need to amass support from the 28% to achieve a majority. The not brand loyal offer a diverse set of issue and culture groups. A great chunk will simply stay home if there is nothing or no one on offer. If Musk puts money into State House and Senate races (500 carefully targeted State House races would cost as much as one high spend US Senate seat), the America Party could deliver a grassroots shock to both parties. Reform sells especially well at that level. And campaign funding is tough to come by. The chatgtp and the gene-story reminds me of my days selling online poker. You would take a person having had luck and blow up the story as if there was a strategy all the time, disregarding the more or less random character of the card being dealt. I am not convinced that one diagnose makes a physician. But if this kind of diagnosis is just maths and sequence analyses maybe it could be used for proof-reading? Anybody knows more about such use-cases in medicine? ChatGTP is so misleading here it is frustrating. First the poster writes “Despite seemingly normal B12 levels”…wait…did he do a Methytmalonic Acid test or only serum B12? Because the path to making a functional B12 in humans is a long one. And did he even get his homocysteine levels checked? Because he might have a B6 deficiency that is causing the B12 deficiency by overstimulating that methylation cycle. This would mean that ChatGTP did not find a solution to his problem and the guy might just be experiencing a placebo effect. But worse yet, that MTHFR polymorphism is not directly associated with lower B12. There is a lot of slop on the internet from pseudo nutritional genomics scams that ChatGTP picked up that links A1298C to B12 deficiency but it is not true! See this study from last year…zero correlation: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-024-05937-z We found a trend of higher ferritin value (p = 0.05) between patients carrying MTHFR C677T homozygous and heterozygous variants. Regarding MTHFR A1298C polymorphism, we found a statistical correlation between homozygous and heterozygous variants and lower hemoglobin values (p = 0.02). We found no statistical correlation between MTHFR polymorphisms and B12 and folate levels, LDH level, spleen size, neurological symptoms, and gastropathy. Did methylB12 help him? Maybe. Will it continue to? IMHO, no. BTW, I carry that same A1298C polymorphism (he calls it a mutation but it is not a mutation, there is a big difference) but I have Aspergers, neuropathies, and illness from a pathogenic SNP in the CBS enzyme and used to have very high homocystine. Only .0008% of people carry my CBS mutation while 10% carry the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism. Thank you very much, good Sir. About 30 years ago, I started having tingling sensations after mowing grass that were lasting longer and longer, eventually several days. Despite concerns about my doctor being a quack, I made an appointment. After arriving, I found a substitute, a retired doctor originally trained in France, and described my symptoms. He asked a few questions about red meat in my diet and I assured him that I generally ate chicken, not much red meat. No tests are performed. After 3 minutes or so he leaves and comes back with a syringe and explains that he’s going to inject me with B-12 and a bunch of other vitamins. I ask if he thinks I’ll need B-12 supplements and he says that I probably will, especially if I’m not getting enough from diet. The cure was virtually instantaneous, next time I mow, no tingling. I have supplemented with various forms of B-12 and the tingling has not returned. By far my best experience with a medical practitioner ever. A couple of decades later, I find out through genetic testing that I also have single copies of a couple of MTHFR polymorphisms, 1298C and C677T, that perhaps explained my long-ago symptoms (or maybe are just coincidental.) Had that substitute doctor not been there, I’m sure I’d have had the same fate as the chat-GPT cured patient – decades of increasingly bad symptoms related to poor circulation. I agree that parenthesis linked to B12 deficiency is common and easily observed by any well trained doctor. But the correlation to the MTHFR gene is not causation. It is highly likely that people who were raised generationally on a high red meat diet probably have these polymorphisms because a diet high in offal is very high in riboflavin, which is the cofactor for the MTHFR gene. So you’re probably deficient in riboflavin as well. Re Tesla’s terrible safety record–inquiring minds might wonder why Teslas haven’t experienced recalls and the truth is that they have been recalled. https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/tesla-recalls-2-million-vehicles-over-autopilot-issue-heres-what-you-need-to-know/ The recall affects these Autopilot-equipped models: 2012-2023 Model S vehicles. 2017-2023 Model 3 vehicles. 2016-2023 Model X vehicles. 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles. That’s nearly all the cars Tesla has sold in the US, according to The Washington Post. You can check whether your car is affected by plugging your vehicle identification number into the Tesla page or the NHTSA page. This so called recall was little more than a software update from Tesla via cell towers. But one might argue that it isn’t enough for Tesla to simply say “oopsie.” Most recalls only apply to individual parts of the car but the claimed self driving feature affects the entire vehicle and the safety of the public driving around it, not just that of the possibly irresponsible owner. Surely all such systems should meet rigorous safety standards and testing by the government itself. Time for a ban on full self drive and maybe those stupid disappearing door handles too? Trump is, after all, out to get Musk. “EU blocks China’s jet” It’s remarkable when you think about it. The Collective West, mostly under the direction of Washington, is trying to sabotage China’s development. Here it is passenger jetliners but you see it with communications equipment, satellites, computer chips, space exploration, etc. And yet with each attempt China just goes it’s own way and through their developments, may end up setting the standards for the 21st century. It will be a tough day for Boeing and Airbus when the Chinese have enough C919s for their own market and tell both those corporations that they are blocking planes from those corporations from their own skies on the grounds of “safety.” With Boeing going there way is been going i doubt ” ” will be needed as one certainly wonders about the safety of Boeing planes. Heard anything about that last crash investigation? (I’ve not) What will come of the air india crash investigation… youtube videos have raised some disturbing possibilities. The collective West never seems to grasp the fact that sanctions, especially if left in place for long periods, usually achieve the opposite of what is desired. The result is typically that the targeted country finds alternatives to whatever it was that the West formerly did. It develops its own domestic industry, it finds alternative customers, and so on. The West ultimately finds itself permanently irrelevant to the targeted country (and perhaps the rest of the world) with respect to whatever was being sanctioned. The targeted country thus becomes stronger and more self-sufficient, not weaker. ““This Bridge Shouldn’t Be Possible”: China Unveils World’s Highest Mega-Structure Now Ready to Open Above the Clouds” ‘Towering 947 feet higher than France’s renowned Millau Viaduct, this bridge is not just a transportation marvel but an emblem of architectural innovation. Built over a span of three years at a cost of $283 million, the bridge’s construction involved cutting-edge technology and meticulous planning.’ Only $283 million to build? While using cutting-edge technology? Can you imagine how much it would cost to build such a bridge in the west and how many years that it would take? Do the Chinese get to build it so cheap as there are not so many beaks being dipped? Although that bridge appears to be real (quick search shows corroborating articles at a number of websites), Sustainability Times is an AI slop farm. If I were interested enough to want to know more facts about it I’d probably start elsewhere… Yes, the entire article, including the ‘photo’ is AI slop. The structure is a suspension bridge – a very lightweight structure that seems to be justified solely as a tourist attraction. It’s in a very remote location and has almost no economic justification apart from the vague assumption that millions of tourists will come and see it. Guizhou province is poor and remote and for some odd reason has become obsessed with bridge building. They’ve spent billions on these bridges (10 of the highest bridges in the world are in Guizhou), claiming that all the traffic and tourists will somehow generate enough money to pay for it all. No doubt the citizens of Guizhou (or whoever is on the hook for all this money) are hoping that this all works out. According to this peer reviewed article in Nature, the economic justification was releasing a lot of economic potential in the region and being a significant part of getting rid of powerty. Apparently the rural places being more connected has generated 110-140 billion worth of economic activity annually. I suggest you read the study. it doesn’t say what you think it does. It is simply laying out a theoretical framework for assessing how to analyse the economic impact of infrastructure using Guizhou and its bridges as an example. Regional economics journals are full of this type of model making. It says nothing about CBA for those projects, thats a different type of assessment. Throwing around random figures for economic generation is standard justification for big infrastructure projects in all countries, you can pretty much come up with any number you want by adjusting a few variable inputs and outputs. I’ve never yet seen a road, bridge, or railway proposal that hasn’t been justified by its supposed indirect economic benefits – often derived by putting random economic values on someone being able to drive to McDonalds a bit quicker. Whether the benefits are real or not is the question and there is little consensus among infrastructure planners as to how to do this. well, scepticism aside, it is a bloody big, beautiful bridge which enables people to get places, strategically situated in the south-east of China, therefore in a region where transport towards the growing economies of south-east Asia is valuable. I don’t think that comments about “being able to drive to McDonalds” count as much more than cheap jibes. I’d say the Chinese government could have put their money into much less desirable projects. The USA way would be spending even more money on even less useful thing, on a private property of some billionaire (or just dump money into Pentagon). Looking at everything trough the profit is why the Western civilisation as we know it won’t live to see the end of this century. P.S. If Trump and Musk were still together, they would probably promise even bigger and better bridge, on Mars, for an affordable price of one hundred billion dollars. It’s definitely a weird article about the bridge. The image admits to being AI generated and my first thought was that the design shown made no sense for a bridge with dimensions indicated. Here’s a link that seems to have real images. https://english.news.cn/20250608/86962626fb8e4a899a1793dae24fc103/c.html I didn’t find any link that indicated the bridge is open yet, though it seems to be nearly completed. It says right below the picture (not a photo), AI generated. It also says that it is an illustration of a specific bridge, that is has no resemblance to. So here’s where AI got it’s ‘bridge sense”?: https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res70/203000/203060-Bixby-Bridge.jpg That’s the Big Sur coastline and the bridge was built in the 1930’s with caste-in-place concrete. So, AI generated “cast-in-place concrete” bridge image, for a text that says “built with steel trusses”, “massive concrete towers”, “glass walkway suspended”. :) @RevKev perhaps you’ve heard of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge? The one that fell down in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake and was judged to be cheaper to replace than to retrofit (originally estimated at $250M)? It was completed in 2013 for $6.5 billion. 24 years, 2.5 km long and 160 m tall. Frick says the current $6.5 billion total is a rough estimate, and that it doesn’t include interest or financing costs. With those costs included, some expect the total price to double yet again—to $13 billion https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-13/how-the-cost-of-remaking-the-san-francisco-bay-bridge-soared-to-6-5-billion On top of that, the old Bay bridge was designed to support two commuter train lines. These were ripped out to make way for more cars, but the load bearing capacity was there. The new bridge section? Cars only. One of today’s linked articles point to a much larger issue than you would suspect from the headline: “Cardinal says race to exploit Africa’s resources is the origin of armed conflict”. The larger issue is the continued argument for an ecological conversion that started under Pope Francis. File under Climate/Environment: The bishops’ conferences and councils from Asia, Africa and Latin America (SECAM, CELAM and FABC) and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America publish a document calling for climate justice and ecological conversion in light of the UN climate change conference, COP30, which will take place in November in Brazil. https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-07/bishops-conferences-ecological-conversion-press-office-vatican.html The joint document presented by bishops of the global south titled, “A call for climate justice and the common home: ecological conversion, transformation and resistance to false solutions,” makes the case for “the Church’s commitment to climate justice and calls nations and governments to action,” as the world prepares for the COP30 in Brazil later this year. The document, shared with Pope Leo XVI, challenges the world’s powerful with ten “commitments and responsibilities” and presents ten specific demands coupled with calls to action, including the Church’s own efforts. The document itself can be found here through a linked PDF. https://www.sjesjesuits.global/2025/07/02/a-call-for-climate-justice-and-the-common-home/ Unfortunately I wasn’t able to read the PDF since I am on a mobile phone, but I was particularly interested in this quote from another article: It calls for economic degrowth, reduction in the demand for materials and goods, and their reuse and recycling. For example, recycling e-waste can help extract critical minerals and reduce the need to mine. It urges the phasing out of fossil fuels, a halt to deforestation and calls for ending the financialization of nature through carbon credits that grant immunity to wealthy asset-owning polluters, who put pressure on resources and the lives of vulnerable groups. https://www.ucanews.com/news/global-south-churches-call-for-ecological-conversion-ahead-of-cop30/109513#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17518086094890&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ucanews.com%2Fnews%2Fglobal-south-churches-call-for-ecological-conversion-ahead-of-cop30%2F109513 saludos The EU refuses to certify China’s C919 aircraft. Meanwhile, China’s C929 and C939 aircraft are just around the corner. These aircraft might prove to be both qualitative and price competitive with Boeing and Airbus, and they are nearly all made with Chinese ingredients. And airlines in Asia, South America, and Africa are more concerned about price than brand names. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqH4N1YlUz0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynik56MdU-I There may be some legal challenges before the C919 is sold outside of China, based on past history of plane makers. Highlights of the 17-year Airbus, Boeing trade war June 15 2021(Reuters) – The United States and the European Union on Wednesday announced a truce in their epic 17-year-old transatlantic battle over aircraft subsidies, hitting the pause button on the world’s largest corporate trade dispute. Canada illegally subsidized Bombardier: Embraer January 26, 2018 RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) – Brazilian planemaker Embraer said on Friday that the U.S. Department of Commerce has shown that the Canadian government “heavily and illegally subsidized” Bombardier and its C Series aircraft, allowing the company to survive and distorting the aviation industry. The statement came just after Bombardier won an unexpected trade victory against U.S. planemaker Boeing Co when a U.S. agency rejected imposing hefty duties on sales of Bombardier’s new CSeries jet to American carriers. The EU is not refusing to certify the C919. They have said it would take 3-6 years to certify, which is not unexpected given that it is a ‘de novo’ application, which is very rare – usually they are started in conjunction with domestic certification bodies and EASA/FAA. Certification is very time consuming as it involves full checks on the entire supply chain – for whatever reason, Comac thought they could just wheel up to Europe and ask for certification (they have not applied for FAA certification). When Embraer and Mitsubishi developed commercial aircraft independently they did joint domestic/EASA/FAA certification processes – this usually takes around 2 years after the first flight, assuming that the actual checking of design and parts was being done well before this. EASA took around 5 years (from first flight to 2012) to certify the Sukhoi S100 – this was done jointly with Russia authorities at the time. The C929 and C939 exist as press releases and models only. The C929 was formerly a joint project with Russia which they played around with for more than a decade before it fell apart, now China is going it alone. Nobody expects to see one flying before 2029 at the very earliest, and even that is dubious. There is almost no information available on the C939 beyond a few very vague press releases. C919 was certified in China 2023 and COMAC has worked with EASA towards certification since 2020 (and EU-China Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement). C919 core parts have already been certified by EASA (as per the video). Even the EASA executive director Florian Guillermet admits that normal certification time is 1 to 2 years, but with C919 they will need 7 to 10 years. All the while there are a few dozen of them flying regularly in China. And about 10,000 Boeing all over the world with Chinese parts in them. Given that COMAC will be busy until 2035 (or so) filling just the domestic orders, this will probably not be a biggie for them, but I can assume European manufacturers may start to face unforeseen obstacles in the Chinese markets soon. It’s kinda hard for EASA to approve an application that hasn’t even been formally submitted yet – the discussions so far appear to have been entirely informal (this at least, seems to have been EASA’s understanding – no doubt Comac thought otherwise). The usual process is for joint certification with national bodies (such as with the Sukhoi, Mitsubishi and Embraer aircraft), and this process starts at an early design stage. For whatever reason, Comac did not seek a joint process and appears to have believed that ongoing discussions constituted part of a certification process, and have now been told otherwise. The 1-2 year time period applies as the period between when a prototype flies and final certification, but this is only the end point of a longer process – the A380 for example, took around 2 years after its first flight to certification, the Superjet took longer. EASA is statutorily responsible for the safety of all aircraft flying in Europe. It has no obligation to make life easy for applicants. Comac could have started the process years ago, but failed to do so, probably because they were entirely focused on the Asian market. It’s also possible that, being newbies to this business, they were entirely unaware of how the process works and the French, being French, didn’t bother to inform them they were doing it wrong. “US/Israel Versus Iran – Round One” Everybody knows that the Israelis are going to go for another try as how dare Iran shoot back. So of course there is going to be a propaganda war to say that the US has to attack Iran again to protect democracy or freedom or mom’s apple pie. But there may be a major spanner appearing to make things harder- ‘Conservative American journalist Tucker Carlson has announced that he will air an interview with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, saying Americans deserve to hear directly from the leader of the country their military has recently fought. In a short video on X, Carlson said the conversation, which was conducted remotely through a translator, will be released “in a day or two.” He acknowledged that he will be criticized for the interview, saying: “Why did we do it anyway? Well, we did it because we were just at war with Iran 10 days ago and maybe again.” He argued that Americans have “the constitutional right and the God-given right to all the information they can gather about matters that affect them,” including hearing the views of adversaries.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621062-carlson-teases-interview-iranian-president/ So will Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham demand that Tucker Carlson have his citizenship or his passport revoked for this piece of “treason?” maybe charged with aiding and abetting the enemy? Thanks for the link Rev. Sometimes it seems as if Carlson is more flash than substance so it will be interesting to see what information comes from this interview. I for one was very afraid that there would be a false flag attack this past July 4th somewhere in America that would be blamed on Iran. It could be used to involve us in Iran. Fortunately it did not come to pass. It seems as though now the emphasis is on creating a proxy war using Azerbaijan and Armenia as foils. Larry Johnston has posted an analysis today on the situation there by David Davidian, an intelligence analyst who lives in Armenia. It is an area that I have little information about and I found it very helpful. It is called Armenia’s Prime Minister Is Trapped and has some needed information about the recent history of the region. It looks like a real problem for Iran and Russia. So! The ugly Americans in company of similarly disposed Brits and Israelis want to send US stuff into Baku? Who knows what can happen? As to US and Israel repeating the recent exchange, how much damage can Haifa and Ashdod endure? How soon before Iran runs out of targets in little Israel? How many B-2s could be claimed to fly next thumping a mountain in Iran? Quite fascinating how elites have lost control of the information system to a large extent in the last couple of decades. Can you imagine this interview happening under the old ABC/CBS/NBC regime? Not only do over the air stations require a federal license to operate but they are also gigantic for-profit corporations supported by other gigantic corporate advertisers. Thus there were plenty of levers available to prevent unwanted content from being available to Americans. Now however, a relatively small operation, or even one dude, can reach the entire US population with whatever he wants to say, and there isn’t much anyone can do about it. Of course this situation underlies the whole “fake news” panic we’ve seen in the last few years as the powers that be try to clamp down on information sources they don’t like. But overall the toothpaste doesn’t seem to be going back into the tube, and my impression is that Americans have largely lost their fear of unapproved people speaking out about whatever they want. This is a real victory for democracy (small d) and will doubtless underlie a lot of societal changes as we go forward. NC has followed the financialization, and corruption, of health care on several fronts. It looks like another Blue Cross/Blue Shield nonprofit, already being governed like a for profit company by the “right sort” of management, is going to finally be taken into the private sector, to seize the assets gained by its former nonprofit status. This is my interpretation of a complex story by LA Times reporter Laurence Darmiento: “Insurer Blue Shield of California’s new parent company alarms consumer advocates” Original story: https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-30/blue-shield-of-california-delaware-restructuring-charitable-obligations Archived story: https://archive.ph/0ZTTj I take an interest in this sort of thing because years ago, something called “Catholic Healthcare Initiatives” or “CHI” took over a bunch of midwestern Catholic hospitals, including the local one. It trashed the local “St. Elizabeth’s” to the point where people who worked there that we knew socially told us to use the other major hospital system. The care at St. E’s had been very superior to the care in the other hospital system (also ostensibly nonprofit) whose CEO of the time flew in from the Bahamas for his 3 day a week job. (Nonprofits run by “the right sort of people” support wealth over service.) The care at St. E’s had been so superior because of a mentoring program for nurses, and staffing levels above those in the other hospital system. We had additional insight into the “trashing” because our family doctor was someone we originally encountered as a hospitalist at St. E’s. He was so good that we followed him when he set up a practice of his own. He too told us to use the other hospital system henceforth. My point in telling this much of the story: At one time there was on-line a fair amount of information about the management of CHI (now renamed CommonSpirit Health), that indicated that it was a nonprofit being run by an interlocking family dynasty that was mining it for “for-profit” like incomes and side hustles. I cannot find anything on-line about that now. But “nonprofit” governance is, nowdays, often a sham. I will vote for Democrats in 2026 if they ban religion and turn over every single Democratic strategist and neoliberal think tankie for the people to do with as they will. Otherwise they can all drop dead. I think in terms of overthrow the lot, but the means elude me, except in dreams. On the real estate article, “The number one reason most experts, myself included, don’t foresee a crash is simple: there just aren’t enough homes to go around. Mark Fleming, Chief Economist at First American, put it perfectly: “There’s just generally not enough supply. There are more people than housing inventory. It’s Econ 101.” And Lawrence Yun from NAR echoes this, stating, “…if there’s a shortage, prices simply cannot crash.” The author’s bias is selling real estate. While we may not be on the brink of Sept 2008, even with a shortage of properties available if the prices are beyond what can be paid, they won’t be. So maybe at the moment we are looking at stagnation. However, the author did not discuss the situation with insurance. The market softness in the SE and Western US could be related to the insurance issue. A little longer term (12 months even) and we might be looking at an economic contraction plus greater insurance pullback. Between less buyers than can afford to buy and fewer banks willing to loan (you’ll never see a bank put down a mortgage without insurance! ) we might see a contraction at least in the areas most impacted. Many of the old existing homes in the Northeast lie in the new flood zones. A Northward shift in the pattern of atmospheric river activity could devastate real estate in the Northeast. A quick look at parcel maps in several areas of the Northeast reveals a crazy quilt of parcels I would expect would be very difficult to develop and build new housing. Very long skinny parcels, long skinny triangular parcels, and random shape parcels predominate. “A trip through the America destroyed by ‘inevitable progress’’ Sadly true this article. Recently I was doing some research on Newark in New Jersey. When I found an address, I would look it up on Google StreetView to see what is there now after a century. Sometimes the original building was still there which was of interest but all too often there would be a vacant lot or wilderness or some such and you knew that a century ago that this would have been part of a neighborhood where families were living. Now long gone. RAND Paper AI a Revolution in Military Affairs got my attention as much as anything else revolutions in military affairs have a bad reputation. It does suggest that AI drive a vast spectrum of swarming cheap robots, drones and self driving vehicles. Selling SkyNet. Quantity has quality. The study recognizes AI can make information into knowledge but does not show how that is done better than the data automation evolutions already applied by militaries. Next goal of data services is knowledge to wisdom, which AI likely won’t provide. The report at least mentions “kill chain’, how to build SkyNet. > Next goal of data services is knowledge to wisdom, which AI likely won’t provide. The thought occurs that the training data for “wisdom” is quite thin at present. Maybe give it a few millennia. I had the relevant conversation about the evolution of IT probably 30 years ago. At the time data bases and networked search were primitive. RAND does not mention “wisdom” nor have I seen it as more like IT nirvana. I once skimmed the Book of Wisdom…. In a different setting discussing wisdom, theological thought is “wisdom is thinking like God”. RE: Texas floods Couple of things; 1) Amusing to watch the blame game for this disaster. 2) Wonder about Amfortas the Hippie – haven’t heard from him for a while. I think he’s in Texas but don’t remember what part. Hope he’s doing OK. He’s in the TX hill country and would probably be in the area but not sure if his land is close to any rivers and specifically the Guadalupe. If I’m reading the wikipedia maps right, he wouldn’t be in the Guadalupe watershed, but did get a lot of rain. Hope that he and his are OK. I am not amused by the commentary, especially coming from those who have taken a public oath to uphold the health of the citizens of this country…….no matter if they are MAGA, whatever creed, race, sex, whatever. https://x.com/Fynnderella1/status/1941567217155571958 The Texas Medical Board should immediately delicense or sanction this MD. This is absolutely evil. I sat by silent for years, far too long, as one MD after the other taunted and humiliated the unvaccinated COVID patients, spewed misinformation and hate, and refused to see unvaccinated patients or patients who were not “following the narrative”. That silence is now over. I will likely join numerous colleagues across the country today who are preparing a complaint to the Texas Medical Board en masse. It is one thing to make statements like this as a citizen. It is entirely different as a licensed, sworn by oath member of our profession. Social media has taken the consequences away from stupidity. We should all be civil toward one another at times of crisis. ESPECIALLY PHYSICIANS! I am done with this. The reputation of the profession is in tatters in no small degree because of antics like this. Literally published while the hunt for bodies goes on. Her colleagues in her own practice have already scrubbed her from their website. It is like she never existed. That is simply no longer good enough. What has happened to my profession? What has happened to the pediatricians, historically the most compassionate and humorous of all the specialties? > What has happened to my profession? Can’t speak for USians but I am profoundly disquieted by the number of medical doctors in the UK who, in a (perfectly understandable) quest to escape the increasingly rules-based and centralised “treatment pathways/protocols” (which are often politicised) are now using their day off to do part-time MBAs. COMPLETELY the wrong thing to do IMNSHO. My medical friends, who were thankfully ignorant of economic issues beforehand, now come out, indoctrinated with Neoclassical nonsense and adhere to the (demonstrably stupid since they don’t deal with opportunity costs) rules and diktats of NICE. They become “difficult” to talk to. I’ve become the “annoying f’witt” thanks to raising questions like “what happened to the THREE factors of production?” & “what’s the fundamental property of a BALANCE sheet?” Which they struggle to give a coherent answer to that is consistent with what has been drilled into them in their MBA course. They have inadvertently become part of the problem, definitely not part of the solution. They should study health informatics instead. My question is, are MDs always speaking as MDs, or are they allowed to express a personal opinion that seems to conflict with their public oath? I’ve known doctors who, away from the office, will talk about trying to get a patient for years to stop smoking and now the patient has lung cancer. And the doctor doesn’t speak sympathetically, calls him a fool, etc. But you know what? When the patient shows up at the hospital, the doctor treats him as well as any other patient. As far as I can tell, the posting was not made on the pediatric site, but on a personal one. I may be wrong, but if not, I may disagree with what she says, but it’s free speech, and she should not lose her job for expressing free speech. Unfortunately, if you look at the multiple threads she did this weekend, she was given multiple chances by colleagues to clarify. The photo on this tweet was not the worst. Not only did she not clarify, she actually doubled and tripled down. It reached truly awful proportions. After the hospital systems she worked with began being bombed with complaints, everything was scrubbed. I guess one of my mottos in life about online posting is if something is worthy of being scrubbed a few hours or days later, it is probably best not to post in the first place. In instances of extreme outrage, I have found it much better for all to unload personally on my trusted colleagues and not published to the world. Much of the time, with colleagues’ feedback, I learn that I am well and truly full of crap and being overwrought. And as you point out there is all kinds of locker room talk of venting frustrations amongst ourselves. It is sheer folly to put this type of discussion on social media Yes, there is free speech. However, there are consequences to free speech. She has every right to say whatever she wants. I have every right to notice that her thoughts are inconsistent with the ideals of the profession and she needs to be held accountable as an example for all. Please note, I did not say a word about her right to say anything. I do decry the social media stampede to this kind of thing. And I have every right, given what she freely said, to never send her, her group, or her hospital another patient until there is appropriate accountability. Why would I expose a single patient to this? As I have said, there was a time when professionals and doctors never said a word in public about their politics. This example is largely why…..although wishing death and harm on others is a bit extreme. There are some saying what about the MAGA who had all kinds of nastiness to say about LA? I would agree. I have searched in vain for several minutes today to find examples of MAGA oriented MDs calling for death and destruction while the fires were burning. I have been unsuccessful finding a single example. The complaint to the Texas Medical Board that you are considering joining is an example of squashing free speech. I’m not in the medical field, but I assume the Board could revoke her license or fine her, something like that. If that happens, then she is indeed being punished for her free speech. As it is, she seems to be getting quite a bit of sh*t from citizens, customers and her employers. This kind of blowback I can’t argue with, but I don’t believe a medical board should be involved unless it involves her actual handling of patients. Abusive or Disruptive Behavior: Engaging in public or private abusive or disruptive behavior towards the general citizenry, patients, their families, or other medical staff. Dishonorable Conduct: Engaging in conduct that is dishonorable or that reflects poorly on the medical profession Those are two of the six very broad categories of the Texas Medical Practice Act that are applicable to this situation. The other 4 are a bit more tangential. This is codified into law by the State Legislature of Texas. It has been signed by the Governor of Texas every single time there is any alteration. It is the law. Every applicant who gets a license in Texas must take a test demonstrating they have mastered the rules and statutes in the Texas Medical Practice Act. It is called the Texas Medical Jurisprudence Exam. I will also tell you that Texas has extremely lenient laws compared to other states. That being said, I have known Texas physicians to have big problems from much less infractions. The laws are very broad and written in such a way that the members of the Board have some leeway in deciding the gravity of the situation. This physician decided to do this in the middle of a national tragedy. I am not sure how much sympathy there will be for her. I will assert that you will find similar statutes in the books of every State of the Union. As was described to me by the Board member when I got my license 35 years ago, the medical license is a privilege not a right. It can and will be revoked for inappropriate behavior. It was reiterated to every young doctor in the room that the main issues with discipline were drugs, addictions, and inappropriate sexual conduct. But also if we by word or action caused great shame to the profession, there would be consequences. Freedom of speech is a right. And she exercised it. We all have that right. However, there is no right to a medical license. A medical license is a PRIVILEGE granted by the states and there are very specific laws and statutes that must be upheld to maintain the PRIVILEGE. The profession as a whole and each state individually has its own rules. Calling for harm to citizens and kids and families simply because of their political beliefs is entirely inappropriate, a breach of medical principles and ethics, a breach of the very foundational oath of the profession, and a breach of the laws enshrined in the Texas Medical Practice Act. FYI – There will be an investigation. From the Chairman of the Texas Medical Board – It is clear they see the same issues with the law that I and many others do. https://x.com/szaafran/status/1941712042022387749 I will go on to reiterate that there is a large contingent of physicians in America that are just sick and tired of this kind of thing and watching our profession dragged through the mud by those among us who thrive in drama and self-righteous behavior online. It is high time that something be done about this. This is the very definition of unprofessional behavior and is causing great problems with trust in our communities. Jacktish, the ancient and modern recognized professions – law, medicine, the clergy – as opposed to the trades, have always been held to a higher standard of social respect and approval. These professions deal with personal contracts, crises and attendant personal secrets. Losing public faith in their carrying out their public duties impartially would be fatal to the professions. imo. re: “I guess one of my mottos in life about online posting is if something is worthy of being scrubbed a few hours or days later, it is probably best not to post in the first place. ” One of the things I’ve drilled into my students, at least wrt their uni email accounts (and hopefully their private email accounts): do not post anything online or in an email that you would not want your grandmother to read or to see posted on the church bulletin board. That last sentence triggered a memory for me. I was reading about Scottish Regiments in the British Army of the 19th century who were very religious and whose orders were given in Gaelic rather than English. One threatened punishment to keep those jocks in line was that any punishment that they would receive in their Regiment would result in it being published and posted in their church back home. Very effective. Sir, a state institution must not infringe on political statement. Laughing and demeaning those who are dying and suffering is not a political statement. It is painful for me to realize that unfortunately in the USA, it has become the norm to engage in this type of thing – but it is not a sign of good judgement – but the most important thing – it is not in any way effective to convince others to join your ideas. And it certainly should not be done by those in my profession. It would have been one thing for her to state facts as she sees them. That is not what she did. The statement violated state laws regarding the conduct of physicians. Physicians consent, as a condition of being licensed, to restrict their behavior, including their speech. I’m not amused by pols covering their asses on this one. People have died. Better, I think, to be pissed off big time, and try to better understand how american capitalism continues to kill and kill and kill. I agree. Seems to me state and federal officials should have been well aware of the flood risk, but chose to ignore the risk and spend money elsewhere. https://theconversation.com/why-texas-hill-country-where-a-devastating-flood-killed-dozens-is-one-of-the-deadliest-places-in-the-us-for-flash-flooding-260555 That’s false. People in the area of the flood report getting MULTIPLE alerts on their cells many hours before the flood hit, and the warnings were clear that the risk was high. What a tragedy and sadly part and parcel of the new normal with these everlasting gobstopper 10-20 inch rain events being a feature… If a similar storm hit here, every last business along Hwy 198 would be underwater and then some, not to mention hundreds of homes. It would be just the storm’s effect locally, but everything falling as rain in the higher climes will come down muy pronto~ Now that ICE has a bigger budget than the FBI,DEA,the Marshal’s service and the ATF combined the fibbies will need to increase their focus on potential Domestic Violent Extremists while ICE will be adding Potential threats to America’s National Security interests. There’s plenty of “Potential” here for budgets and AI is the right tool to use to fully exploit that potential! False positives are a plus both because of budgets and the way it encourages people to stop saying mean things about our betters. On being repurposed to go after different groups, during the investigations by HUAC (the House Un-American Activities Committee) on the State Department, it went from hunting down communists to hunting down homosexuals under the guise of hunting down communists. Employees would come to the interviews with investigators thinking that they would be good Americans giving information about spies only to be shown pictures of themselves going into gay and lesbian bars and asked about that. It was started by Senator McCarthy’s aide Roy Cohn, who was homosexual. I’m always amazed (and I shouldn’t be by now) that people do not think about the future use and abuse of new laws and powers given to an administration. They can learn form Ukraine’s TCC on how to maximize their profits and still show some results… Hey, wait a minute. The Ukrainians employ snatch squads to grab future “recruits” off the streets – while ICE uses snatch squads to grab possible illegal emigrants off the streets. I’m seeing a similarity here. Next step – a Night and Fog decree like in 1940s Germany where people would go out in the dark and fog and would just disappear never to be seen again= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacht_und_Nebel https://reclaimthenet.org/doj-antitrust-lawsuit-trusted-news-initiative-big-tech-independent-media The US DOJ seems to be supporting an interesting selection of what appears to be rabid anti-vaxers. Interesting. That Chinese language video is yet another amusing example of Orientalism. People often forget that Edward Said’s famous eponymous work wasn’t just about how European imperialists used knowledge of the other as a technology of imperial control. It was also about how the colonized sometimes actively participate in their own self-orientalization. This amusing video relies on the confusion between graphemes, morphemes, and sememes to impress viewers for whom translation is necessary. The contrast between the familiar and the unfamiliar seems innocent enough but it subtly encourages identifying the familiar with a norm or standard. One would never guess from watching it that there is a long history in the 20th Century of debates among linguists concerning the viability of the very concept of “word.” Chinese language(s) underwent major transformation, predominantly in the 20th Century, following the invention of a national language, what we commonly call “Chinese” or “Mandarin Chinese” today. This transformation spanned everything from the grammatical to the lexical. Today, a lot of people are quick to criticize the PRC for “social engineering” policies, especially in places like the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. These people probably forgot, or didn’t know in the first place, that practically everything about modern China, starting from the national language, is the result of a “social engineering” project. I concluded she was just trying to sell her services as a tutor or some other such general-service linguist. It’s not easy to make money as a linguist when you’re competing with MT and LLMs. ‘Tears My Heart to Pieces’: North Carolina Braces for Medicaid Cuts (NY Times via archive.ph) President Trump’s domestic policy law jeopardizes plans to reopen one rural county’s hospital — and health coverage for hundreds of thousands of state residents.

The largest of the two ongoing trials (NCT06742281) seeks to enroll up to 10,016 participants by mid-2026 with the study completed by mid-2027. (bold mine) LOL, that’s swell! Imagine if there was any urgency to reduce the spread of a level 3 biohazard in the middle of year six of the Pandemic, ha. The Schryver article above says Iran won “a major strategic victory” in the recent war with Israel. A few days ago, the strongly pro-Zionist Telegraph in the UK published new details of the damage done to Israeli military sites by the Iranian bombing, according to satellite data. Such information still cannot be published in Israel. https://archive.ph/cT1KO I wonder if the Russians and/or the Chinese were slipping the Iranians exact longitude & latitude coordinates of Israeli targets for maximum effect. I doubt the Russians would, under the current administration. The almost 2 million Israeli Jews of Russian ethnic background are still regarded as part of the global Russian population deserving of protection. My guess is that most of what Iran gets from Russia are defensive weapons. China may have fewer conflicted loyalties like this, however. Russia would have to remember though that World Likud regards Russia as an enemy of Israel. Why that would be I have no idea, especially as there are so many Russian-Israelis. Russia would remember how Israeli jets deliberately put a Russian Il-20 plane in the path of Syrian aerial defenses a coupla years ago leading it to be shot down with the deaths of 15 Russians. And they would remember how at the beginning of the Hamas war, over 1,000 Israelis who were fighting for the Ukraine had to pack up and return home. And more recently how the modus operandi of the Israeli attack on Iran resembled the Ukrainian attack on Russia’s bomber force. Apparently lots of ordinary Russians took note of that one as did the government. Chuck Schumer once said that so long as two bricks leaned against each other in America, that it would be loyal to Israel. I do not think that there is a similar feeling in Russia for them. Israel demands total loyalty. The USSR during the 1970s and 1980s started leaning toward the Arab cause despite having been the first country to recognize Israel earlier on. They (or, rather, their successor, the Russia Federation) still haven’t lived that down as far as the Likudniks go. And really any original sympathies the USSR had lay with the Israeli Labor Party, which has pretty much been rendered an irrelevancy since Begin and Sharon and Netanyahu started dominating the political scene. But Putin and Netanyahu do have some kind of ongoing relationship which is not entirely adversarial, in spite of the official positions of their governments being at odds in a number of serious ways. I forgot when posting this that the original ruling socialist party was Mapai, which eventually merged with some allied parties to form Labor. And apparently the party has recently rebranded themselves as the Democrats, a not very felicitous choice. “The almost 2 million Israeli Jews of Russian ethnic background…” Information in Wikipedia puts the proportion of citizens from Russian/former USSR at 15% — 1,557,698 people according to the latest figures. It is a lot, but still significantly below 2 million. Thanks for the correction. I was trying to quote from memory something Putin said recently when explaining why “guaranteeing Israel’s security” was important to Russia. Maybe he was exaggerating, or maybe the translation was inexact. Or, more likely, maybe it’s that my memory is not too great these days!

But of course, sadly, this interview sums up everything that is also wrong with the US antiwar left and which encapsulates its incompetence in certain areas. I am a bit puzzled that US folks who are so obsessed with figuring out the US MIC and military conduct in general like Horton have apparently almost zero understanding about the serious nature of military affairs in the Ukraine War.

Please go to a normal browser window and enter the code there Brendan Moynihan was visiting the bathroom up to six times a day and all he was passing was blood. Still, he was dismissed by his doctor and repeatedly told that he was “too young” for bowel cancer, a cancer which can affect any part of the colon or rectum. His doctor was wrong. Brendan was diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer at 38 years old, and more than two years on from his recovery, he is dedicated to raising awareness and funds to fight against this disease. Talking to Irish Country Living over Zoom from his home in Sydney, Australia, he says it is a world away from his native homeland of Berrings, a rural townland near Ballincollig, Co Cork. He describes growing up in rural Cork with fondness – “I played Gaelic football, I played hurling, I was really sporty all my life.” After moving to Dublin to study at DCU, he then worked with Kerry Group for many years before moving to Australia on a career break. “I haven’t moved back. I’m here now 14 years,” he says. Brendan is talking to us during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in Australia. Bowel cancer is Australia’s most deadly cancer for people aged 25-44 years old. It is also the second most common cause of cancer death in Ireland, with over 2,500 new cases of bowel cancer reported every year. There has been a rise in the diagnosis of younger people too. Figures from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland, which examined more than 25 years of data, highlighted that the incidence rate had doubled (up to 2019). Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic, tells Irish Country Living that it is important for younger people to be aware of bowel cancer and its symptoms. Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic. “There can be a tendency for some people to consider bowel cancer as a disease that only affects the older population, but we know that more and more young people are being diagnosed,” she says. “In many cases with younger patients, we are seeing people present with the more advanced forms of bowel cancer.” This is the myth that Brendan is keen to dispel in his advocacy: “bowel cancer is not an old man’s disease,” he says fervently. Struggle to get diagnosis When Brendan was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the end of 2022, he was living in Melbourne and had been experiencing extreme tiredness for several months. This is one of the symptoms of bowel cancer that can go overlooked. “I’m a runner,” says Brendan. “I run five days a week and I got to a point in August 2022 when I couldn’t run 500 metres. I just had no energy and that’s what prompted my first visit. “I visited my doctor over a six-month period and he dismissed me on five different occasions. He kept saying to me: ‘you’re too young’ for bowel cancer. Brendan completed the Melbourne Marathon in 2023 to raise funds for Bowel Cancer Australia. “That’s a big thing that needs to change all around the world. It affects people of all ages and it affects both genders.” Brendan went to a different doctor in December that year. “I got to a point where I was in so much agony, I wasn’t sleeping. I was unable to function at work.” It was Christmas week, and he remembers the visit clearly. “I knew by his body language and his tone as he listened to my story that I was in trouble.” In January 2023, Brendan underwent right hemicolectomy surgery [surgery that removes the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon] and about half of his large colon was removed. “What I know today is very different to being diagnosed because when the news was broken to me, I wasn’t even aware of bowel cancer. It was not on my radar at all.” It was difficult for Brendan being diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer with his family on the other side of the world but he says that the short time period between his diagnosis and operation made it easier. “I had such a short window to get my life in order. I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve and my first surgery was 9 January. I didn’t have time to stress about it, whereas my recovery and especially my time off work was a lot more challenging.” Although Brendan still goes for scans every six months, he considers himself “one of the lucky ones”. Everything was covered by his private health insurer and the tumour had not metastasised to other parts of the body. “Luckily they managed to remove everything that needed to come out through surgery. Provided I could pass stool naturally myself within a period of time, I could go home.” Fighting on Since his operation, Brendan has been heavily engaged in raising awareness of bowel cancer. He delivers talks, contributes to podcasts and recently shared his story on national TV in Australia. “I am an ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia and our biggest initiative is called Never2Young. We go to Parliament every year to meet politicians and demand they do more.” Brendan shared his experience of bowel cancer on The Morning Show in Australia in June. Brendan also does his own fundraising for Bowel Cancer Australia through sponsored runs. “My goal is to raise $100,000/€55,000,” he says. Brendan works in brand management, and his employer, the Coca-Cola company, have donated $10,000/€5,500 to his fundraiser. With a working background in whiskey, Brendan also organised a big whiskey auction last year and raised $17,000/€9,000. “It’s kind of leaning into my network to spread the word and then leverage connections to get the money for bowel cancer,” he says. Brendan’s big message is to go for regular checks with your GP. “I think rural people have a tendency to say: oh, it will be grand. “If there’s something wrong health wise, go and speak to your doctor. Equally, if you’re not happy with what they tell you, get a second opinion because you know your body. It costs you nothing and you have everything to live for. “I love that more and more people are talking about this. I think rural people are less likely to openly talk about things like poo, as an example, but the more we’re aware and talking about it, the greater chance of catching this early.” Professor Gleeson also stresses that the earlier bowel cancer is detected, the better the outcomes. She highlights the importance of the national screening programme [people aged between 59 and 70 in Ireland are eligible for free bowel screening every two years] and a colonoscopy. “Bowel cancer oftens begins as a growth called a polyp, located inside the colon or rectum. Finding and removing polyps can prevent bowel cancer,” says Professor Gleeson. “A colonoscopy after an abnormal unexplained stool test is associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of cancer death. “If you are experiencing any unusual symptoms relating to your bowel that persist for a long period of time, you should visit your GP,” says Professor Gleeson. “If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed, it does not automatically mean that you have bowel cancer, but you should check with a medical professional who can discuss next steps with you.” Bowel cancer: know the symptoms In Ireland, the national BowelScreen programme also offers free bowel screening to people aged 59 to 70 every two years. Screening helps to detect bowel cancer at an early stage. People who wish to take part in the screening programme are sent a screening test kit in the post. The Irish Cancer Society have warned that bowel cancer screening uptake is going backwards and nationwide awareness needs to be increased. According to HSE data, only 2 in 5 people who were eligible to participate in BowelScreen actually took part. Ireland’s target uptake is just 45%, which is nowhere near the EU recommended bowel cancer screening target uptake of 65%. What are the symptoms of bowel cancer to look out for? B is blood in your stool. O is obvious changes to your bowel habit e.g. diarrhoea or constipation. W is unexplained weight loss. E is extreme tiredness. L is lumps in your stomach or your abdomen. If you are displaying one or more of these persistently, see your doctor. Scan the QR code for Brendans Go Fund Me page for Bowel Cancer Australia.

Provided I could pass stool naturally myself within a period of time, I could go home.” Fighting on Since his operation, Brendan has been heavily engaged in raising awareness of bowel cancer. He delivers talks, contributes to podcasts and recently shared his story on national TV in Australia. “I am an ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia and our biggest initiative is called Never2Young. We go to Parliament every year to meet politicians and demand they do more.” Brendan shared his experience of bowel cancer on The Morning Show in Australia in June. Brendan also does his own fundraising for Bowel Cancer Australia through sponsored runs. “My goal is to raise $100,000/€55,000,” he says. Brendan works in brand management, and his employer, the Coca-Cola company, have donated $10,000/€5,500 to his fundraiser. With a working background in whiskey, Brendan also organised a big whiskey auction last year and raised $17,000/€9,000. “It’s kind of leaning into my network to spread the word and then leverage connections to get the money for bowel cancer,” he says. Brendan’s big message is to go for regular checks with your GP. “I think rural people have a tendency to say: oh, it will be grand. “If there’s something wrong health wise, go and speak to your doctor. Equally, if you’re not happy with what they tell you, get a second opinion because you know your body. It costs you nothing and you have everything to live for. “I love that more and more people are talking about this. I think rural people are less likely to openly talk about things like poo, as an example, but the more we’re aware and talking about it, the greater chance of catching this early.” Professor Gleeson also stresses that the earlier bowel cancer is detected, the better the outcomes. She highlights the importance of the national screening programme [people aged between 59 and 70 in Ireland are eligible for free bowel screening every two years] and a colonoscopy. “Bowel cancer oftens begins as a growth called a polyp, located inside the colon or rectum. Finding and removing polyps can prevent bowel cancer,” says Professor Gleeson. “A colonoscopy after an abnormal unexplained stool test is associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of cancer death. “If you are experiencing any unusual symptoms relating to your bowel that persist for a long period of time, you should visit your GP,” says Professor Gleeson. “If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed, it does not automatically mean that you have bowel cancer, but you should check with a medical professional who can discuss next steps with you.” Bowel cancer: know the symptoms In Ireland, the national BowelScreen programme also offers free bowel screening to people aged 59 to 70 every two years. Screening helps to detect bowel cancer at an early stage. People who wish to take part in the screening programme are sent a screening test kit in the post. The Irish Cancer Society have warned that bowel cancer screening uptake is going backwards and nationwide awareness needs to be increased. According to HSE data, only 2 in 5 people who were eligible to participate in BowelScreen actually took part. Ireland’s target uptake is just 45%, which is nowhere near the EU recommended bowel cancer screening target uptake of 65%. What are the symptoms of bowel cancer to look out for? B is blood in your stool. O is obvious changes to your bowel habit e.g. diarrhoea or constipation. W is unexplained weight loss. E is extreme tiredness. L is lumps in your stomach or your abdomen. If you are displaying one or more of these persistently, see your doctor. Scan the QR code for Brendans Go Fund Me page for Bowel Cancer Australia.

Title: Ethereum ETF Inflows Remain Green Despite Price Struggles – Here Are The Numbers

Time Published: 2025-07-06T04:00:03Z

Ethereum’s price performance over the past 48 hours has been relatively subdued, suggesting that the altcoin’s recent rally may be cooling. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has dipped by just over 1%, with Binance showing a 1.22% decline and CoinGecko reporting a slightly steeper 1.81% drop. Intraday trading activity has been confined to a narrow band between $2,478 and $2,555, according to data from CoinGecko. However, beneath the surface, a different narrative is unfolding with steady inflows into Ethereum-based Spot ETFs. According to updated data from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, US-based Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of 36,439 ETH on July 4, valued at approximately $92.19 million. This builds on a solid showing the day prior on July 3, when daily net inflows into the ETFs totaled $148.57 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs were on a roll of inflows in the just concluded week, with the latest Friday inflow making up four days of inflows out of five. The only day of outflow was on Wednesday, July 2, when the ETFs witnessed a negative netflow of $1.82 million. The lion’s share of Friday’s inflows came from the iShares (BlackRock) Ethereum Trust, which added 32,987 ETH, equivalent to $83.46 million in value. The fund now holds a substantial 1.81 million ETH, worth over $4.57 billion. Despite the relatively flat market price, this continued accumulation shows the current state of institutional confidence in Ethereum. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust also added 3,105 ETH on the day, even as its larger sibling, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), recorded minor outflows of 77 ETH. Meanwhile, other players such as VanEck, Bitwise, and Fidelity have maintained positive inflow momentum across the week. Over a seven-day period, the total net inflow across all listed Ethereum ETFs stands at 76,892 ETH, equivalent to roughly $194.54 million. Technically, Ethereum is starting to move into a consolidation pattern with its price action in the past 48 hours. It’s hovering above support at $2,400 but below resistance in the $2,600 range. Over the past seven days, Ethereum has mostly moved in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,630, ending the week with a gain of roughly 4%. At the time of writing, Ethereum is up by 4.1% in the past seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. This outpaces Bitcoin’s 0.7% gain in the same timeframe. Interestingly, Ethereum price action is forming what looks like a wedge pattern, according to technical analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart. This analysis places emphasis on the resistance at $2,600, which could open up a rejection to another support level at $2,200. Many analysts are eyeing breakouts above $2,600 and $2,800 for a possible rally to $4,000, while a drop below $2,200 could trigger a pullback to the $1,750 area. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,515, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Look for another war to spring up soon and these vultures will once again appear and place a bet. If only they would push for regime change in Mexico. I’d be down for that one. I recommend that ZEEPERS-B’-US replace Blackrock. “ BlackRock halted its search for institutional investors in January, causing the planned funding that sought to secure $500 million from governments, development grants, and investment banks, and another $2 billion from private investors, to fall through.” *********************************************************** Poor fools… USAID, their premier source of OTHER-PEOPLE’S-MONEY has gone with the wind. “Blackrock didn’t get the outcome it wanted, and now the war will end.” Hmmm, maybe a connection between the Zeepers and Blackrock - there has to be something driving them. That BlackRock is pulling out is more proof Ukraine is a sinking ship, destined to be another Moldova. “I recommend that ZEEPERS-B’-US replace Blackrock.” Ha. just like they won’t go and fight, or send their kids to fight, they wouldn’t spend a cent of their own money on it. It was going to be good old Uncle sucker again, stuck with the loss when it failed. That’s why Zelensky was trying so hard to get Harris elected. Europe/WEF is the center of the deep state now. What regime could gain control in Mexico that wasn’t immediately co-opted or killed by the drug cartels? Thus making the change of “government” there meaningless. Will the iron grip of the cartels have to be broken like that of the Mafia was here in the US? And yet there is still a mafia here too, no?

Title: Cork boss Ryan still sees room for improvement

Cork hurling manager Pat Ryan watched his side stride into the All-Ireland SHC final with a 20 point demolition of Dublin, but still sees room for improvement as he targets a 'perfect' performance in the final. The Rebels ran out 7-26 to 2-21 winners at Croke Park as Ryan’s men blew Dublin away with a second-half performance where they scored 3-13, restricting Dublin to 1-09. Alan Connolly claimed a hat-trick while Brian Hayes and Tim O'Mahony both hit the net twice as the Rebels secured their place in the All-Ireland final for the second year in a row. Speaking to RTÉ Sport after the game, Ryan admitted that he was pleased with the nature of his side’s victory but insisted that they will have to be better in the final if they’re to end their 20-year wait to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup. "I’m delighted, we came up here to win, that was the key aim," he said. "We knew we were coming up against a formidable team after the way they played (against Limerick) and we prepared really well for them. "We knew the last three or four weeks have gone really well. We were disappointed by one or two injuries today that left us short but we did well. "But having said that, there were still areas that we weren’t happy with. Our efficiency wasn’t good enough, our tackles from behind weren’t good enough and we gave away one or two sloppy goals that we weren’t happy with. "That’s something that we’ll work on, everything needs to be perfect from now on. For an All-Ireland final it wasn’t perfect last year, so we need to be perfect in two weeks time. "You just can't take the foot off the pedal. We will train really well over the next two weeks, that's our plan and we’ll hopefully will go one better we did last year." Cork manager Pat Ryan still sees room for improvement, despite his side claiming a 20 point victory over Dublin in the All-Ireland SHC semi-final at Croke Park. pic.twitter.com/b6ZA16hGm0 Dublin rarely looked like repeating the shock victory they claimed over Limerick in the semi-final as Cork were comfortable throughout, but Ryan was unhappy with some of their play in the first-half. He explained: "We just tried to get back to what we were doing. I thought we probably didn't take our scores and left a couple of wides behind us and they got a lot of short puckouts against us where we were chasing the ball. "We just weren’t really tuned it. Fellas were looking to get scores as opposed to looking to get tackles, hooks and blocks." Meanwhile man of the match Connolly – who ended his day's work with 3-02 from just six shots on goal – felt the Rebels’ lightning-fast start was crucial. "Our goal was to have a good start and we got that," the Blackrock forward said. "We were a bit worried if it would dip going into half-time and it did a bit but we kept going. You look at the scoreboard and see it’s seven goals, we’re delighted with that win. "We work it as a team. We [the forwards] stop the ball going in and they [the defenders] keep the ball coming in. Savage ball coming in, but everyone played their part." When Dublin did threaten to work their way back into the game late in the first half, Connolly reckoned the Munster men’s solution was simple and effective. "We just scored a goal, like!" he told RTÉ Sport. A massive Cork crowd made its way to Croke Park for a semi-final that played out in front of a packed house. The red jerseys in the stands proved an inspiration to the men wearing them on the field of play. "It was a good performance, we’ve no doubt the Cork crowd will follow us again in two weeks’ time so we’re looking forward to that one," Connolly beamed.

Title: BlackRock Issues De-dollarization Warning, Says Rising Debt Levels Could Push Capital Outside US Borders: Report
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/05/blackrock-issues-de-dollarization-warning-says-rising-debt-levels-could-push-capital-outside-us-borders-report/

The largest asset manager in the world says the risk of a de-dollarization of the global economy has edged higher due to rising US debt levels. In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters, BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government’s fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, “We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets.” The firm’s investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP – about 29% of all its revenue – on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. “Despite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing – and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments… With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: BlackRock drops Ukraine fund – Bloomberg
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621038-blackrock-drops-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-05T15:36:02Z

US investment holding BlackRock stopped its search for investors to back a multi-billion dollar fund for rebuilding Ukraine earlier this year, Bloomberg has reported. Interest reportedly dropped after President Donald Trump retook the White House. The fund was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome next week. It had been close to securing backing from firms supported by the governments of Germany, Italy, and Poland, the outlet wrote on Saturday, citing anonymous sources. Nevertheless, BlackRock reportedly decided to shelve the talks early this year “due to a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty over Ukraine’s future,” after the US changed its stance towards Kiev under the current administration. Trump has long promised to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has sought avenues to reach a peace deal. He has also pushed European NATO allies to take over the burden of militarily supporting Ukraine. Earlier this week, Washington reportedly froze critical arms deliveries to Kiev to focus on replenishing its own stockpiles, although the US president has insisted some military aid still continues. The Trump administration “was a notable absence from the fund’s backers in December,” Bloomberg added. In March of last year, BlackRock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand indicated that the Ukraine Development Fund was on track to secure at least $2.5 billion from private investors, countries and other grant lenders. A consortium of such investors could finance at least $15 billion towards reconstruction work in Ukraine, he said. However, a BlackRock spokesperson indicated that the firm is no longer engaged in “any active mandate” with Kiev, having finished its pro-bono consulting work with the Ukraine Development Fund last year, Bloomberg wrote. The investment firm, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. Moscow has repeatedly condemned foreign arms supplies to Kiev, arguing that they make pro-Ukrainian Western nations party to the conflict, which Russia views as a NATO proxy war. The Kremlin has stated that the recent freeze in US military aid to Kiev will accelerate settlement of the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com I have been investing consistently since the beginning of 2025. I am 23 and I want to set myself up with the possibility of retiring early at the age of 55, living solely on my investments. My portfolio is composed thusly: Primarily ETFs consisting of S&P 500, STOX600, Vanguard FTSE All World ETF, and Gold. I also have speculative investments in the fields of nuclear power, quantum computing and to a lesser degree Cryptocurrency related stocks (MicroStrategy, Etoro, Webull, BlackRock, Coinbase, (without directly buying any cryptocurrency) I have done well for myself so far with a sizeable unrealised gain and frequent dividend payments. However, I have some queries which persist. Lately, I have been bombarded with emails and calls to sign up for a Private Pension Plan. In a way, I have my investment portfolio intended to cover my retirement expenses. Is there any benefit in investing in a pension plan instead/also? What is the catch? My second question revolves around taxes. Namely I understand that taxes are paid on any realised gains. Seeing that my investments are yielding unrealised gains, and any dividends gained are reinvested; what are my obligations regarding local taxes? My third question has to do with the fact that when I near my retirement age, I need to start liquidating my assets. How would you approach this matter? Would you liquidate a lump sum every year or withdraw money from the brokerage account gradually? My last question has to do with the brokerage application I use. I have in the past dabbled with some day trading on eToro. I have moved past trading to some disciplined Dollar Cost Averaging on Trading212. I find the interface of this application intuitive as it facilitates rebalancing and the stock purchases are commission free. Trading212 has long been touted as an ideal application for beginners. But I feel a consistent sense of insecurity on the long-term (up to retirement) sustainability of the application and how would my investments be affected if the platform goes bust. Regards, Disciplined Young Investor Dear Disciplined Young Investor, First of all—well done. Many people don’t even have such a goal, let alone by age 23. The fact that you’ve already thought about retiring at 55 and are investing consistently is a strong foundation. With a time horizon of 32 years, you’re giving yourself a real chance. Historically, by consistently applying DCA (dollar-cost averaging) into the market - especially something like the S&P 500 - you’re likely to see average returns of around 8–10% per year. You’ve set yourself up well. Your portfolio appears to be thoughtfully constructed. From what you've described, you’ve included a mix of broad-based ETFs such as the S&P 500, STOXX600, and Vanguard FTSE All World, along with some exposure to gold. This type of approach is often associated with diversification and relatively lower fees. Including a smaller allocation to sectors like nuclear energy, quantum computing, and crypto-related equities suggests that you've taken an interest in emerging industries as well. While every investor's approach will differ, having a clear strategy and awareness of your overall risk profile is always a good starting point. On your question about private pension plans—here’s the straight answer: There are two main advantages: 1. 25% tax credit (capped at €750/year as of the latest update - check for changes yearly). 2. Illiquidity: This may not seem like a benefit now, but the fact that you can’t access it until retirement actually protects you from dipping into it impulsively in the future - especially when life throws unexpected costs your way. But there are drawbacks too: Whether or not to open a private pension plan depends on your personal circumstances and long-term goals. While some individuals choose to include it as part of their broader financial planning (mainly to benefit from the tax credit and the structured approach it offers) others may prefer to continue investing independently. If it’s something you’re considering, I’d suggest reviewing the terms carefully, paying close attention to all fees involved, and seeking guidance from a licensed financial advisor before making any decisions. On the tax side, it is best to always consult with a licenced tax advisor in such case. As a Financial Coach I’m afraid I cannot help you much there. On withdrawals at retirement: You don’t need to worry too much about this now, but as you near your goal of retiring at 55 (or even before), the strategy will have to shift. When that time comes It is again best to consult with a licenced tax advisor specialised on investing to see what would make most sense to your portfolio at that point in time. And lastly: Trading212. I agree that it’s intuitive, low-fee, and great for DCA. But I do understand your concern about long-term sustainability. The key question to ask is whether the platform is regulated by a major authority—like the FCA (UK), or MFSA if local. If it is, your investments are technically held with a custodian, not the platform itself, meaning that if Trading212 ever goes bust, your holdings should remain safe. That said, it’s smart to stay updated on the platform’s status, and eventually—when your portfolio gets larger—you may want to consider splitting your funds across two platforms (or more), just as an added layer of protection.

Title: Elizabeth Plunkett: How murdered woman’s family discovered they were not ‘relevant victims’ in serial killer case

When something false is repeated often enough, it has a tendency to become accepted fact. At some point a seed of incorrect information takes root in the public discourse before spreading through newspaper articles, books and political statements. Eventually, the actual truth becomes almost impossible to discern. It is a phenomenon known to researchers as the illusory truth effect. The family of Elizabeth Plunkett came face to face with this effect in 2023 after getting a call from the Parole Board. Elizabeth was a 23-year-old woman from Ringsend in Dublin who, in 1976, was kidnapped and murdered by two English men. The killers, John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans, had come to Ireland with the aim of murdering one woman every week. A month after Elizabeth’s death, they murdered another young woman, Mary Duffy, from Co Galway, before being caught by gardaí and confessing to their crimes. Shaw and Evans became known as Ireland’s first serial killers. Both received life sentences and Evans died in custody in 2012 at the age of 72. Shaw (78) remains in Arbour Hill Prison. He is Ireland’s longest-serving prisoner. He sought to change that in 2023 by applying for parole, having already been granted release for two days a year. Under a new parole act passed in 2019, the Plunkett family had an automatic right to express their views on Shaw’s parole bid. When the family were contacted by the Parole Board, it was decided two of Elizabeth’s sisters, Bernadette Barry and Kathleen Nolan, would speak for all of the siblings. They spent hours drafting their submissions, explaining the ongoing trauma of Elizabeth’s murder and the effect it had on their parents who both died a few years afterwards. Shaw should not be released under any circumstances, they said. “I poured my heart and soul into that,” said Kathleen this week. “It was like slicing me open, with the trauma of remembering.” They repeated the process later in person during a meeting with two members of the Parole Board who would decide Shaw’s future. “We got emotional, we got angry – it was gruelling,” recalled Bernadette. Afterwards, the family put the matter to the back of their minds and prepared for the wedding of Kathleen’s daughter that summer. That August, the sisters got a call from the solicitors representing them in the parole process and were asked to come into the office on a Saturday morning. Their solicitor, James McGuill, informed them that the Parole Board had made a serious mistake. It had been discovered the Plunkett family were not “relevant victims” and therefore had no right to take part in Shaw’s parole process. This was because Shaw had in fact never been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder. Bernadette and Kathleen could not believe what they were hearing. For decades, newspaper articles and books had repeated the same “fact”: that John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans – “Ireland’s first serial killers” – were serving life for the murders of Elizabeth Plunkett and Mary Duffy. More than that, various State agencies were under the same impression. Over the years, every time Shaw or Evans was moved out of the prison, for example for hospital appointments, the Irish Prison Service (IPS) contacted the Plunkett family “as relevant victims” to let them know. Similarly, the Parole Board had contacted the family in the belief that Shaw had been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder, only to realise belatedly its mistake. “There’s retired judges on the Parole Board,” said Kathleen. “The highest echelons of Irish society get these jobs on these boards. They’re highly educated people, and yet no one checked this out.” How did this illusory truth take hold? A look through the archives provides a few clues. Shaw and Evans confessed to raping and murdering both women shortly after their capture. However, the prosecution was a convoluted affair. First, a judge granted a defence application that the men be tried separately, as each one was blaming the other for the murders. For reasons that remain unclear, the judge also ordered the men be given separate trials for each of the murdered women, meaning a total of four trials. The hearing began in July 1977, when Shaw went on trial for Mary Duffy’s rape and murder. To the surprise of many onlookers the jury became deadlocked on a verdict. He was retried and subsequently convicted. [ The late summer murders: Two men on a mission to kill Irish womenOpens in new window ] The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) then successfully appealed the original judgment mandating separate trials, meaning they could try Evans for both of the murders at the same time. Following the trial, he was convicted of Mary Duffy’s murder but, for reasons that are also unclear at this remove, the judge ordered the jury to find him not guilty of Elizabeth Plunkett’s killing. Both men were sentenced to life for Mary Duffy’s murder. Then, in 1979, the DPP dropped the charges against Shaw relating to Elizabeth’s rape and murder. To date, nothing has emerged to explain this decision. It is possible the DPP believed Shaw would never be released so there was no point in going through the expense of another trial. Like the rest of Irish society, Bernadette and Elizabeth, who were teenagers at the time, went through their life believing Shaw was in prison for their sister’s murder. They explained that during the trials, their father went to great lengths to shield the family from the trauma of the process. “The way it was in the house, it wasn’t discussed. My father would just shut down any conversation about it because it set my Mammy off. It was all about trying to keep us together because we were all ready to just lose the plot,” said Bernadette. “When you see somebody going to jail and there was a court case, you just automatically live your life thinking, yeah, they were found guilty,” said Kathleen. After being informed about the Parole Board’s mistake in August 2023, the sisters decided they would refuse to accept the label of “not relevant victims”. Their solicitor hired two barristers to examine the case. After searching through the records, the lawyers found that not only had there been no conviction for Elizabeth’s murder, no inquest had been held either. It would later emerge that a death certificate had not even been issued for the young woman. It felt like Elizabeth had been erased, the sisters said, and they were determined to address that. The sisters wrote to the Garda, the DPP and the Government but got nowhere. At that point they decided to go public and made contact with the RTÉ Documentary on One team, having been impressed by their investigation into abuse in Blackrock College. “I said to Kathleen: they’re meticulous. They have to be. Because they can’t afford to be sued after all the Ryan Tubridy thing,” joked Bernadette. The sisters have nothing but praise for the documentary team, and in particular its producer Liam O’Brien. Last month RTÉ started publishing a six-part podcast on the case called Stolen Sister. Earlier this year, thanks to the sisters’ campaign, an inquest was finally held into Elizabeth’s death which recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. However, officially, no one has been convicted of her death and the Plunkett family still have no say in Shaw’s parole. [ From the archive: State’s longest-serving prisoner in fresh bid to secure temporary releaseOpens in new window ] His last parole bid was rejected. He is expected to apply again early next year. James McGuill, their solicitor, has called on the Garda to reopen the murder investigation with a view to securing a murder conviction against Shaw. The Garda has said its investigation concluded in 1976 and the matter is one for the DPP. The family have received legal advice that, in rare cases, it is possible to reopen a case after charges are dropped. One path being pursued by McGuill and the two sisters is gathering enough new evidence to allow prosecutors to reopen the case. They have had some success to date. After the inquest, and particularly after the start of the RTÉ series, multiple women have come forward to say they believe they were also targeted by Shaw and Evans during the men’s 1976 crime spree. [ Eight women come forward with information on being targeted by 1976 killers of Elizabeth PlunkettOpens in new window ] This includes a woman who was knocked down by a car very close to where Elizabeth was abducted in Co Wicklow. These testimonies will be passed on to the Garda and DPP, McGuill said. Looking back, Kathleen says she can understand her father’s desire to protect them from the trial and why he “hid the newspapers behind the sideboard”. “When anyone would it bring up, he’d say: ‘Let Elizabeth Rest in peace’, because he couldn’t cope,” she said. Nevertheless, they are determined to keep up their campaign for Elizabeth’s case to be reopened by authorities. “They thought these two auld ones would just go away, said Bernadette. “But no, sorry, not when you’re fighting for your family.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Finding George Gibney: ‘I feel sad for 13-year-old me and nine-year-old Ber, who were not believed’

Time Published: 2025-07-05T05:00:00Z

Earlier this week, not long after The Irish Times had printed the story of George Gibney’s arrest in the United States under the headline “George Gibney facing 79 charges relating to alleged sexual abuse of four girls,” my phone pinged. “I am so glad. But feel sad for 13 yr old me and 9 yr old Ber, who were not believed,” it said. The text was from Tric, a talented swimmer, who had been one of six people involved in a case in Ireland against Gibney in the 1990s that was halted in the Supreme Court. The sentiment had nothing to do with self-pity but the name, the arrest, the charges hit hard, like an emotional jolt from the past. The broad outline of the allegation in the news story about Gibney’s US arrest was not dissimilar to the case involving Tric Kearney, Ber Carley and others. [ US government asks court to detain George Gibney until Irish extradition case is concludedOpens in new window ] The latest legal filings lodged in the US district court showed that Gibney had been accused of 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape over the alleged sexual abuse of four girls and the alleged attempted rape of one of the girls. Much like those allegations made decades ago, all four girls were minors, aged between eight and 15, and were coached by Gibney at the time of the alleged abuse. The text was a reminder that sometimes in the glare of headlines and the frenzy of how quickly news moves, how many charges are brought and how many people are involved, the human cost to nine- and 13-year-old girls can be forgotten. The original 1993 charges, at Dún Laoghaire District Court, were 27 counts of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge of young female swimmers under the age of 15. But no case was ever heard in Dublin. Gibney’s accusers have never had their day in court and that has been a devastating truth to live with and a source of deep frustration for more than 30 years. Gibney’s lawyer argued in an Irish Supreme Court judicial review at the time that he could not defend himself, as some of the allegations went back to the 1960s. It was true, some charges did go back that far. But some were also from the 1980s, just 11 years earlier. The line of defence that allegations reached too far back in time was an idea that became a dark in-joke to those involved in the case. It was simultaneously absurd and enraging. Gibney had introduced modern ways of training to his athletes. Before his name became synonymous with allegations of abuse, he was diligent and detailed and encouraged swimmers to keep meticulous diaries so that if they swam a national or event record, they could look back and see what training they had been doing to get the time. They kept their diaries. Following on from the Supreme Court ruling, Mr Justice Declan Costello in the High Court granted an order prohibiting the Director of Public Prosecutions, Eamonn Barnes, from proceeding with the charges against Gibney. Leave to appeal was granted but no appeal was made by the State. Gibney left Ireland when he was released in July 1994, a free and innocent man in the eyes of the courts. By then the Sunday Tribune (where I was working at the time), along with Gibney’s star swimmer of the time, Gary O’Toole, a double Olympian from Seoul and Barcelona, and European Championship silver medallist, had taken up the story and published details of the allegations against the coach. In an unusual request, all swimmers who were mentioned in the Sunday Tribune were asked for sworn affidavits and agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper’s defamation lawyer Hugh Mohan. For surety, more legal advice was taken from barrister and future Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman. The assumption was that Gibney would sue. But he did not. By the time the story was published he was already on the move and turned up in Warrender Baths Swimming Club in Scotland, working as a coach. Warrender, who had a medical doctor on their board, were horrified when informed of the allegations made in Ireland. By the end of 1994 Gibney was sacked and fled again, this time to the US. With an uncanny knack of moving and turning up at places where they needed a swimming coach, he emerged at the North Jeffco Swim Team in Arvada in Colorado in late 1995. He seemed to be endlessly landing on his feet. [ Why has it taken so long to arrest George Gibney in the US to enable extradition?Opens in new window ] People wondered how that could be before realising that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA), the then governing body of swimming in Ireland, had robustly defended Gibney and showed him astonishing deference. An example of that was in 1992, in what most people would have considered clear grounds for standing down Gibney as national coach. After the Barcelona Olympic Games in which O’Toole competed, he wrote to the Leinster Branch requesting a meeting them in December at the Ashling Hotel in Dublin, where he was accompanied by another swimmer, Chalkie White, and the husband of a female swimmer. O’Toole spoke first to the president Harry Kavanagh, the secretary Mary O’Malley and the treasurer Eddie Eaton, telling them he believed Gibney was a paedophile and had been sexually abusive to boys and girls for years. He advised them that the gardaí were involved and taking statements from various people and alleged that Gibney had tried to get into bed with him as a young swimmer before the young O’Toole garnered the strength to ask him to leave the room. The husband said to the Leinster Branch that his wife had been repeatedly sexually abused by Gibney and White alleged that as a boy he too had been molested by the coach. O’Toole urged the Leinster Branch to remove Gibney from Irish swimming and cancel a swimming course for 11- to 15-year-olds a few weeks later in early January. However, when Gibney was asked to step away, he threatened to sue the organisation. The juvenile course went ahead with Gibney in charge. Gibney was given life membership by the IASA in 1989 and despite the court case and the Sunday Tribune coverage, it was not rescinded until the beginning of 1997. The Sunday Tribune sent their story to Colorado and Gibney was moved again, this time to California, before settling in Florida. This week, with the arrest of the 77-year-old in Florida, the image of a younger Gibney standing at the pool deck with the large round glasses and goatee beard, the timing device slung around his neck like a stethoscope and the Sergio Tacchini polo shirt, has circled around and again brought people back in time – back to a small 25-metre swimming pool in Blackrock, Co Dublin, where a club called Trojan used to train. Trojan was where talented Irish swimmers wanted to be during the 1970s and 1980s, because Gibney was one of the best. It’s where he got his break after starting out working in swimming clubs at various pools around the Dublin area, including the Guinness pool, Marian and Waterford Crystal before moving to Glenalbyn in the early 1970s – a pool that is no longer functional, located beside the Kilmacud Crokes GAA club in the suburb of Stillorgan. A convincing, can-do coach, Gibney struck up close relationships with swimmers’ parents, easily gaining their trust, and by the mid-1970s Trojan was the top club in Ireland. He had a highly convincing personality and his CV was impressive. As well as being national director of swimming, he had published works on lactate testing in swimmers. He was a member of the National Training and Coaching Centre in Limerick University and the Irish Recreational Management Association, as well as an RTÉ Sports commentator for the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he rapidly rose through the swimming ranks in Ireland to become the Irish Olympic coach in 1988 for the Seoul Olympic Games and the IASA’s national director of swimming in 1991. But just three years after that appointment he was leaving everything he had created in Ireland. Behind were the accusers left to deal with an alleged abusive coach who they said had shattered their trust and altered their lives, a swimming association that turned away when their need was most desperate, and the rank failure of an Irish judicial system that had given process but, in their eyes, denied dignity or justice. Gibney might have been ducking and diving by state-hopping in the US, but because of the company he had kept at home, he was never far from the Irish public consciousness. By the end of 1997, Derry O’Rourke, who succeeded him as national coach, stood in the dock at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where he pleaded guilty to 29 sample charges of sexual abuse against 11 young swimmers on numerous occasions between 1976 and 1992. Early the following year, O’Rourke, who used to try to hypnotise his swimmers, was jailed for 12 years by Judge Kieran O’Connor. O’Rourke’s investigation began in 1993, the year Frank McCann was formally charged with the murder of his wife, Esther McCann (née Leonard), and his 18-month-old foster-daughter Jessica McCann, when he set fire to their family home in Rathfarnham. The couple had been trying to adopt Jessica, but the process had been delayed, due to information gleaned by the adoption agency that McCann, president of the IASA Leinster Branch and a swimming coach, had fathered a child with a 17-year-old student. McCann is currently serving a life sentence in Arbour Hill Prison. It would take more than another decade but Ger Doyle, a successor to both Gibney and O’Rourke as national coach, would also find himself in the dock. In 2012, the 51-year-old from Wexford pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual assault and 34 charges of indecent assault at New Ross Swimming Pool between January 1981 and December 1993. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and released in 2015. To many people it beggared belief how so many figures involved at the higher levels of Irish swimming chimed so closely with allegations of child sexual abuse. But with the considerable attention and the constant pressure on the swimming association, the centre couldn’t hold, and the sport collapsed. The then minister for sport Jim McDaid stopped funding to the IASA in 1998 and set up what was ultimately an unsatisfactory inquiry, where witnesses were not compelled to attend and many did not. The Murphy Report was subsequently published in June 1998 and soon after the IASA was replaced with Swim Ireland. For many, that was the end, or at least a new beginning. But not for all. Several Irish news outlets, including the Irish Star, RTÉ’s Prime Time and the Sunday Tribune made journeys to Colorado, California, and Florida. They upset the tempo of Gibney’s life and made it uncomfortable, but didn’t move the dial regarding him answering the allegations made against him in Ireland. In 2016, Justine McCarthy, author of Deep Deception – Ireland’s Swimming Scandals and now an Irish Times columnist, reported that the Garda gave a certificate of character to George Gibney to support his application for his American visa, dated and stamped January 20th, 1992. [ For over 30 years, George Gibney has lived as a free man, without having to face a trialOpens in new window ] From the Dáil, Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan pressed home the need for a concerted approach from the police in Hillsborough County in Florida, where Gibney lived, and the Garda in Ireland. O’Sullivan’s letters followed the work of investigative journalist Irv Muchnick at the end of 2017. He had gone to the Californian courts in his case, Irvin Muchnick v United States Department of Homeland Security, seeking details of how Gibney had come to be in the US. He asked who had helped him with employment, who had written letters of comfort, and why, given his past, he had been allowed to remain a long-time resident alien in the country. Nobody knows exactly how much pressure the reporting, the door-stepping, court hearings in the US and letter writing to their congressional members put on the Irish State to act. In February 2018, The Second Captains released a 40-minute podcast called The George Gibney Case: 25 Years On. “The greatest illusion that was perpetrated in sport ever. There was nothing about that man that was real,” said O’Toole about his former coach Gibney. Second Captains producer Mark Horgan used the quote when he wrote a piece in The Irish Times in 2020 before the release of the 10-part podcast series Where is George Gibney? The big reaction to the 2018 piece pointed to real interest in the Gibney case and prompted them to consider a greater interrogation of the story. When Dylan Haskins, the commissioning executive for podcasts with BBC Sounds, was sold the idea for something more extensive and investigative, Horgan and Ciaran Cassidy hit the road. On and off for two-and-a-half years the pair travelled across the US, where they tracked down people who had previously stayed silent. They discovered new information on Gibney’s past and the path to where he resided in Florida’s Seminole county. During one of their visits to Florida, Horgan and Cassidy confronted Gibney outside his home. But he wouldn’t talk to them, wouldn’t listen, and awkwardly got into his car and drove away. “You couldn’t shut him up,” said Horgan. “That was, until the day he decided he’d never speak publicly again.” The silence and the voiceless shuffling of Gibney as questions were barked at him reached the ears of those swimmers who had not been part of the original 1990s case. Four came forward to make statements to gardaí alleging Gibney had sexually abused them between 1971 and 1981. By 2021, with the statements gathered, detectives at the Sexual Crime Management Unit had a criminal investigation and in May 2023 a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It directed that Gibney should face trial on 79 criminal charges; one charge of attempted rape and 78 of indecent assault. In the coming months, the outcome of the extradition and legal process in Ireland will be known. But already the four women who have made the allegations have gifted something those who went before them, something they have not had for many years. They have given them hope. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: If Institutions Are Buying Why Isn’t The Bitcoin Price Going Up?

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Matt Crosby Bitcoin price not soaring despite institutional billions? Uncover why profit-taking and derivatives hold it back, with a breakout looming! ETF inflows and institutional purchases continue to climb, yet many investors are puzzled by the muted Bitcoin price action. With billions flowing into BTC, why aren’t we seeing the price explode to new highs? The reality is more nuanced than it first appears. Looking at the ETF cumulative inflows chart (excluding GBTC outflows), it’s clear that demand from institutional players has been robust. Since the most recent pullback in late March, net ETF inflows have climbed from roughly 527,000 BTC to over 630,000 BTC, an increase of around 100,000 BTC in under 3 months. These are significant numbers, yet the Bitcoin price has largely mainly drifted sideways since the start of 2025. It’s important to remember that not all ETF flows represent “institutional” buying in the purest sense. Many ETF purchases come from client allocations, for example, family offices or high-net-worth individuals using platforms like BlackRock. Still, these flows matter, and the steady accumulation is a positive driver for long-term supply and demand dynamics. Complementing ETF inflows, corporate treasury buying has also been strong, with (Micro)Strategy leading the charge. MSTR alone have seen their holdings have jumped from roughly 528,000 BTC to over 592,000 BTC in this year alone. Across all treasury companies tracked, total holdings now exceed 823,000 BTC, representing an astounding $86 billion in value. Despite this, many market participants feel underwhelmed by price action compared to prior cycles. But we must contextualize expectations: the BTC market cap is now in the multi-trillion-dollar range. The sheer scale of capital required to drive exponential moves today dwarfs previous cycles. Comparing this cycle to the 10x returns of earlier eras isn’t realistic. In truth, BTC has more than doubled from $40K at the time of ETF launch to recent levels above $110K, a still monumental achievement for a maturing asset class. To understand why Bitcoin prices haven’t surged even further, we must examine selling behavior. By analyzing HODL Waves data for 1-5 year bands, we can quantify long-term holder profit-taking. Over the past three months, more than 240,000 BTC from these older bands has been distributed to the market, nearly a quarter-million BTC in net outflows. This selling has largely counterbalanced institutional accumulation. Given that daily miner issuance still adds another ~450 BTC to the market, we see why price has struggled to break higher: the market is in a state of supply-demand equilibrium. Meanwhile, open interest on BTC derivatives markets has exploded. From under $5B less than 3 years ago to over $25B today. Many new participants prefer are opting to trade “paper BTC” on derivatives rather than buying spot BTC, which reduces the positive influence on price of increased market participants. There is however now reason for optimism. Long-term holder selling is now decelerating, with recent net outflows falling below 1,000 BTC per day, a substantial reduction from previous monthly averages just weeks ago. If institutional inflows remain steady and retail demand starts to awaken, even at levels seen earlier this cycle rather than extreme prior peaks, we could easily see another powerful leg higher. Past instances show that when retail flows surge from these levels, BTC can double in price within months. ETF inflows and treasury purchases are pouring billions of dollars into Bitcoin, but the muted Bitcoin price reaction makes perfect sense when viewed through the lens of supply and demand. Heavy profit-taking by long-term holders and growing derivatives speculation have balanced out the inflows. As long-term selling subsides and institutional buying continues, the stage is being set for the next bullish impulse. Whether we see the euphoric retail mania of prior cycles remains to be seen, but even modest retail inflows combined with current institutional demand could drive prices sharply higher sooner rather than later.

Fidelity outpaces BlackRock in ETF inflows, but broader BTC demand slump limits upside momentum. U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (exchange-traded funds) are back with a bang, posting the second daily inflow of $601.94 million on the 3rd of July. However, the Fidelity BTC ETF fund (FBTC) has recently seen more aggressive demand than BlackRock’s IBIT. In fact, at press time, FBTC led inflows with $237.13 million, compared to IBIT’s $224.53 million, SoSo data showed. On the 2nd of July, FBTC also dominated the BTC ETFs, attracting $183 million of the overall $408 million inflows seen on that trading day. Source: SoSo Value Since Q2, the sustained inflows into FBTC have increased its holdings to 199,493 BTC as of 4th of July. This translates to $22 billion worth of net assets per current prices and 1.02% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Fidelity’s BTC ETF growth is part of a broader surge in institutional accumulation from Q2. Notably, ETFs scooped 111,411 BTC in Q2, increasing their overall BTC stash by 8%. But public corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), bought more BTC (131K BTC) and grew their BTC stash by 18%. On the ETF side, Fidelity was second only to BlackRock’s IBIT in terms of total BTC holdings. IBIT had 692,887 BTC or 3.3% of the total BTC supply, as of the 4th of July. However, according to Fintel data compiled by AMBCrypto, IBIT saw higher institutional holder growth of 9% compared to FBTC’s 2.6% in early Q3. It meant more major institutional players like hedge funds and endowments piled on BlackRock than Fidelity. Source: Fintel However, overall share-holdings and capital allocation were down in early Q3, suggesting a trimmed position likely linked to recent quarter-end rebalancing or diversification. That said, the strong demand from ETFs and public treasuries has not managed to juice up the broader spot market demand. According to CryptoQuant, the apparent demand has dropped to 857K BTC despite ETFs and Strategy buying 748K BTC. Per the analytics firm, the broader contraction could cap BTC upside in the short term. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of Bitcoin demand; overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” Source: CryptoQuant As a result, CryptoQuant stated that although ETFs and Strategy’s buys were positive, they ‘are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs.’ The asset was valued at $108.8K, at press time, after tagging $110.5k on the 3rd of July.

Title: European ESG rebrand challenges NZ ethical investing norms – Fran O’Sullivan

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. European stock exchanges are redefining ESG to include defence under "energy, security and geostrategy". Photo / Getty Images THE FACTS New Zealand company directors take note: European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. In truth, the Europeans have had their collective ass handed to them by Donald Trump. The US President has strong-armed Nato members into increasing their defence budgets to 5% of GDP. However, the Europeans are determined their increased expenditure should boost their own defence companies – not simply be used to buy American military hardware and boost the profits of those American companies contributing to the US war machine. Back here, New Zealand companies have devoted thousands of pages in successive annual reports to trumpeting their prowess on environmental, social and governance metrics (traditional ESG). Some are required by law. Some frankly fall into “feel-good” box-ticking (often notable among failing companies!) and a deflection from a company’s true commercial driver, which is to post a profit and stay in business. It is time for a rethink. As with DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies, which even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink (a previous champion) has walked away from, there is a sharpening of focus. At the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week, chief executive René van Vlerken was quick to emphasise that the heightened geopolitical risks – obvious on Europe’s backdoor where the Russian-Ukraine conflict verges on a “forever war” – has made for the more existential approach. The Amsterdam exchange is part of the pan-European stock exchange Euronext, which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal as well as the Netherlands. In May, Euronext’s chief executive and chairman Stephane Boujnah said the redefinition of ESG was in response to a “new geopolitical order”. “European aerospace and defence companies have expressed the urgent need to invest heavily in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy for the next decade,” Boujnah said. Euronext said it would revisit the methodologies for ESG indexes to limit the exclusions currently placed on defence companies. This poses a challenge for traditional ESG ratings agencies when it comes to advertising investments in defence industry-related bonds (for instance). It also has ramifications for entities like the New Zealand Super Fund and KiwiSaver funds, which walk a tightrope on definitions of ethical investing, with all sorts of activists getting exercised over where the funds invest. How will funds approach investing in New Zealand companies ranging from aerospace to quantum computing or drone manufacturing – all within the scope of the Government’s new defence plans – when there is a clear implication their products will be used in armed conflict? Euronext has said it will encourage the rating agencies to restrict the concept of controversial weapons solely to armament activities prohibited by relevant international treaties. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. I was in the Netherlands with 40 business leaders on the New Zealand Initiative think tank’s Go Dutch study tour, which was designed to provide insights from small, advanced economies. Fortuitously, our time in the Netherlands coincided with the Nato Summit in the Hague. It also coincided with the US attack on three nuclear facilities in Iran with “bunker buster” bombs and Tomahawk missiles, which made for frantic rebooking of flights back to New Zealand after some airlines pulled back from flying over the Middle East. Trump did attend Nato, being hosted overnight by the Dutch King and Queen in their personal palace before a truncated Nato meeting. At the summit, the allies made a commitment to investing 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements and defence and security-related spending by 2035. At least 3.5% of GDP was to fit within agreed definitions of Nato defence expenditure to resource core defence requirements and to meet Nato’s Capability Targets. The other 1.5% was to be invested in protecting critical infrastructure; defending networks; ensuring civil preparedness, resilience and innovation; and strengthening the defence industrial base. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was also in the Netherlands. He was the only political leader from the Indo-Pacific Four – Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand – to attend the Nato Summit. It was noted that he had turned up. Luxon contends he was under no pressure to increase New Zealand’s defence spending above the targeted 2% of GDP within the decade that was outlined in the recent Budget. But this is a more dangerous world. It was notable that when we visited Rotterdam – which hosts Europe’s largest port and some fully-automated container terminals – that the Dutch Ministry of Defence wants to acquire terminal capacity for handling multiple ships carrying military cargo (mainly equipment and ammunition) simultaneously. It has been agreed within Nato that this type of cargo can be transported via the Netherlands, even if the destination is outside the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, where older Dutch people still hold sharply to the lessons from the Nazi occupation in World War II – and where they have more recently been hurt by soaring energy prices sparked by the withdrawal of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine – there is a quiet confidence. With 26% of land under sea level, the Netherlands has developed extensive water management systems, including dikes, dams and polders (land reclaimed from the sea) to manage the obvious risk. There is a frank realism there – we could do with a bit more here. Disclaimer: Fran O’Sullivan met her own costs to take part in the New Zealand Initiative’s Go Dutch study tour. These are her views.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 12:30:55 PM PDT by thegagline The Trump administration plans to implement a process whereby farmers in Iowa can vouch for hard-working, law-abiding migrant farmworkers who may be facing deportation, so that they can remain in the U.S. The proposed process was shared by President Donald Trump during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday night, kicking off a year of patriotic celebrations meant to honor the nation’s 250th birthday. Trump said the new plan will take place in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and that legislation for the measure is currently being drafted while speaking Thursday evening from Iowa. “You know, they’ve had people working for them for years. And we’re going to do something … we’re going to sort of put the farmers in charge,” Trump told the crowd of people in attendance. “If a farmer has been with one of these people that worked so hard – they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that, but they work very hard, and they know him very well, and some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen – if a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristie, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” “We don’t want to do [border security] where we take all of the workers off the farms,” Trump added. “We want the farms to do great.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Title: Nvidia becomes most valuable company ever at $3.92T, leaving Microsoft and Apple behind
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nvidia-becomes-most-valuable-company-ever-at-3-92T-leaving-Microsoft-and-Apple-behind.1051249.0.html

Full Content:
The surge of Nvidia's market value is fueled by the AI race, as lot of companies are fighting over a share of the AI reserves, Nvidia is simply supplying weapons to all sides of the war. Though Nvidia has many AI models of its own, it isn't targeting endpoint consumers or making chatbots for everyday use. One of Nvidia's models, Nemotron‑4 (340B), is used to generate synthetic data used for training LLMs. Thanks to the increasing competition among tech giants to build the most advanced AI data centers, train cutting-edge models, and dominate the sector, Nvidia is cashing in. It supplies most of the chips used for these purposes. Just 2 weeks ago, Nvidia became the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion. Hitting this new all-time high represents a ~17.4% growth from the $3.34 trillion market value we reported about 2 weeks ago. Unless the AI race slows down, Team Green is likely to keep seeing green. Fun fact: The world’s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, manages over $11.5 trillion in assets but has a market value of about $182.6 billion. CompaniesMarketCap.com
