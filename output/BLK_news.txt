Conor Pope reports. Europe must avoid not just a tariff row “but a verbal escalation” with the US, Italy’s minister for enterprise Valentino Valentini has warned. “We need to respond collectively, patiently ... avoiding not just a tariff escalation but also a verbal escalation which can be just as dangerous,” he told Eoin Burke-Kennedy. What makes you feel wealthy – flashy income or quiet investment? It’s a topic that Joanne Hunt explores in Money Matters, and finds that the short term hit may not match having long term savings.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) is listed on German, French, and Dutch stock exchanges, according to a prospectus on the iShares website. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” the prospectus reads. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock to learn more. Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, would custody the digital assets for the investment vehicle, according to the prospectus. BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 was considered a pivotal moment in their eventual approval in January 2024, given its status as the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. It's iShares Bitcoin Trust has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, the most among the 11 bitcoin funds currently trading, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Spot Bitcoin funds now control nearly $100 billion in assets. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum fund has received more than $4 billion in assets since it debuted in July 2024. Crypto ETFs have given investors exposure to the asset in a more familiar financial product. Separately, in an announcement Tuesday, tokenization platform Securitize said that it had launched BlackRock’s $1.7 billion tokenized treasury fund BUIDL on the Solana blockchain. “Following the one-year anniversary of BUIDL’s launch, BlackRock and Securitize are expanding access with a new share class on the Solana network,” Securitize said in a post on X. “This milestone marks an important step in the continued institutional adoption of tokenized real-world assets,” it added.

Title: $11,500,000,000,000 BlackRock Launches Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Product in Europe: Report

Time Published: 2025-03-25T22:01:51Z

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, launched its first European Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) on Tuesday. According to a Bloomberg report, the iShares Bitcoin ETP (iB1T) began trading on Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, and Germany’s Xetra exchange, offering institutional and retail investors regulated exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance. The product is physically backed by Bitcoin and secured through Coinbase Custody International Ltd., according to the report. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product, characterized the launch as a significant industry milestone. “It reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” The European expansion follows the success of BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust, which has accumulated over $50 billion in assets since its debut last year. By entering European markets, the firm signals its continued commitment to integrating cryptocurrency investments into mainstream financial strategies. Earlier this month, BlackRock reportedly incorporated its iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) into some of its model portfolios. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, reportedly wrote in an investment commentary at the time that the firm believes Bitcoin has “long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: PsiQuantum raising at least US$750 million

Full Content:
Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum is raising at least US$750 million ($1.2 billion) at a US$6 billion pre-money valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter. BlackRock is leading the fundraising effort, which has not yet been completed, one of the people said. Unlike some quantum computing startups using exotic materials, PsiQuantum is aiming to modify traditional manufacturing techniques from the semiconductor industry. The company uses existing photonics technology - the same kind of chipmaking used to make the fibre-optic connections for internet communications - at a factory run by GlobalFoundries in New York, saying it plans to make millions of quantum chips. Scaling up those plans to make a high volume of quantum computing processors is a costly, complex endeavour and requires fundraising, one of the people said. Startups and major tech firms alike are chasing quantum computing, which can solve complex problems that would take conventional computers thousands or millions of years, such as predicting how atoms and molecules will interact. Scientists hope to use quantum machines to develop new materials for batteries and new drugs. In recent months, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Amazon have all unveiled new quantum computing chips. Last week, Nvidia, the world's biggest chip firm, said that it will establish a quantum computing research centre in Boston. PsiQuantum is working with the governments in Australia and the United States to build two quantum computers in the coming years - one in Brisbane, Australia, and the other in Chicago. Australia is investing almost a billion dollars in the startup, although there are few details on what the investment entails, and attempts to gain an explanation have so far been thwarted. Quantum computers have been around for decades but have produced too many errors to be more useful than conventional computers. In recent years, companies have made advances in making better quantum chips and correcting those errors, with PsiQuantum saying it believes it will have a useful machine by 2029 or sooner and Google saying earlier this year that it will have useful quantum applications within five years.

Blockchain technology is receiving a boost with the XRP Ledger, based on recent findings from industry observers. The system has handled over 2.8 billion transactions without any security failure, which has caught the eye of financial institutions globally. According to Jasmine Cooper, RippleX Head of Product, the effectiveness of XRPL is one of the major reasons institutional investors are drawn to it. Institutional asset issuers and investors are using XRPL more because of its speed and reliability. For example, OpenEden has recently hit milestones in tokenizing US Treasury bills on the platform. Institutional investors are purchasing these tokenized assets that desire access to on-chain financial instruments. BlackRock, the global asset management titan, is also making a push into asset tokenization, lining up with XRPL’s platform. Regulated exchanges like Archax are even listing tokenized assets created on the ledger, and it’s becoming more acceptable to mainstream financial institutions. XRP Ledger Adoption is Surging! Institutions, DeFi, Stablecoins, Tokenization Jasmine Cooper, Head of Product at RippleX, joined me to discuss the latest and the greatest with the XRP Ledger. 02:34 Jasmine’s background 04:43 Real Estate on Blockchain 06:18 RippleX overview… pic.twitter.com/HkC2ubbflA — Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) March 23, 2025 XRPL is revolutionizing the way people buy and sell real estate by enabling tokenization. Firms such as Propy utilize it to facilitate automatic property sales, minimizing paperwork and accelerating transactions. This facilitates real estate trading and makes it more accessible. This change might have a huge effect on an industry that is normally sluggish and convoluted. Through blockchain, XRPL assists in making transactions easy yet secure and reliable. DeFi on XRPL is gaining traction, owing to fresh technology such as the Automated Market Maker (AMM). The functionality allows traders to exchange assets and provide liquidity directly on the blockchain, eliminating the role of centralized exchanges. RippleX is also looking to simplify XRPL for developers. The firm is introducing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that enables developers to create Ethereum-based smart contracts with the advantage of XRPL’s low-cost, high-speed transactions. This element is likely to have more DeFi projects hitting the ledger and improve its connectivity with other blockchain networks. Ripple recently rolled out RLUSD, a new US dollar-backed stablecoin, on a small number of small crypto exchanges. The stablecoin will be applied in cross-border payments and liquidity. RippleX is said to be seeking regulatory approval to ensure that RLUSD meets the regulations, which could make it more appealing to institutional users. The stablecoin is positioned as an adjunct to XRP, already employed as an international bridge currency. If the RLUSD gains traction, adoption of the XRPL network is likely to further increase.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: A $41B Investment Firm Wants to Stick With Just Bitcoin ETFs as Safer Bet

Earlier this year, Calamos made its crypto debut with the launch of not one but three funds designed to protect investors from the volatility in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. But the global investment management firm, which handles $41.3 billion in assets, is far from launching any other products beyond bitcoin, — even Ethereum (ETH), said its head of ETFs Matt Kaufman in an interview with CoinDesk. Since their inception, Calamos’ protected BTC funds have attracted over $100 million from investors, which primarily include financial advisors. For most firms looking to make an entrance into the crypto market, launching a bitcoin product is just the first step in a long journey that quickly extends to ethereum-based products. BlackRock, for example, applied to launch its spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in June 2023 and five months later, did the same for Ethereum (ETH). “Ethereum doesn’t really meet our criteria for being able to effectively hedge that exposure,” he said. “It’s not a liquid asset, there’s no options on Ethereum ETPs so if those check boxes start to get built, we’ll explore it but right now it’s not on our radar.” The Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOJ), Calamos Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXJ) and Calamos Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTJ) offer investors 80-100% downside protection with an upside cap rate of 10-55%. This is achieved by using a combination of Treasuries and options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index. While Cboe Exchange has filed to list options tied to Ether ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January delayed its deadline to approve or deny the product. The Commission will have to stick to the final deadline in May, however. Another asset class that Calamos won’t likely ever touch is meme coins, Kaufman said. “We’re a risk manager, so we build things we know will work,” he said. “From that perspective, I don’t have any opinion on meme coins but it’s not something I would ever do.” Kaufman believes that the recent surge in applications for meme coin ETFs highlights the fact that investors have to do their due diligence. “We live in America, you have to know what you own. Freedom gives you choice and with choice comes responsibility,” he said.

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—A federal court ruling regarding ESG investing with BlackRock could put public pension funds on the defense, a consumer group is warning. Consumers’ Research sent letters to the largest public pensions boards in each state Tuesday warning BlackRock’s focus on ESG–an acronym for environmental, social, and governance–could lead to serious liabilities and a breach of fiduciary duty and put trillions of dollars in American pension money at risk. In a first-of-its kind federal court decision on ESG, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, of the Northern District of Texas, held in January in the case of Spence v. American Airlines that the airline’s pension was in breach of its fiduciary duty for allowing BlackRock to weigh ESG consideration in employees’ retirement plans. BlackRock was not a party in the lawsuit. “In Spence, offering BlackRock funds in the company’s 401(k) plans violated the company’s duty to focus only on financial returns because publicly available evidence put the plan fiduciaries on notice that BlackRock uses its funds to pursue goals other than financial returns—like the ESG goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” says the letter shared with The Daily Signal. BlackRock, based in New York, had an asset portfolio totaling $11.6 trillion in 2024. It has come under fire in recent years not only for ESG investing but also for ties to China, as well as having former executives in highly placed administration positions under President Joe Biden. The company also leveraged its resources to push changes to the board of ExxonMobil. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported BlackRock broke with climate groups and eliminated diversity targets in a story headlined, “BlackRock’s ‘Woke’ Era is Over.” However, Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, contends BlackRock is still promoting net-zero carbon and is trying to rebrand. “This ruling shows there could be lawsuits against the state pension fund or lawsuits against pension trustees,” Hild told The Daily Signal. “ESG investing is a danger to pension holders, a danger to taxpayers, and a danger to pension trustees that could be held personally liable.” He said he’s hopeful this will change the investment strategy of the firm going forward. “This is not a vendetta against BlackRock, but I am opposed to pushing a political agenda with people’s retirement,” Hild added. American Airlines investments reportedly did not have ESG objectives and did not underperform. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” a BlackRock spokesperson told The Daily Signal. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” The court ruling stemmed from a class action lawsuit by American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence with more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. O’Connor, an appointee of George W. Bush, said in the opinion, “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the plan.” American Airlines did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this story. The Consumers’ Research letter Tuesday asserts state pension boards should review their investment with BlackRock to ensure similar problems—such as politicized investments—aren’t happening. “In conclusion, any state pension board using BlackRock to manage its pension plans is now on notice that a federal court has found that BlackRock acted with an ‘investment strategy … focused on ESG investing’ and ‘a pursuit of non-pecuniary interests,’ and fiduciaries of a fund that invested with BlackRock breached their duty of loyalty,” the letter continues. In January, Consumers’ Research sent a letter to all Fortune 500 companies warning of potential fiduciary duty violations and investment with BlackRock.

Title: Solana Rises As BlackRock Brings Its $1,700,000,000 Tokenized Treasury Fund to Ethereum Rival’s Chain

Solana (SOL) is green on the day on reports that BlackRock is moving its blockchain-based money market fund onto the Ethereum (ETH) competitor’s network. Fortune reports that the world’s largest asset manager is adding its $1.7 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana blockchain. Solana is trading for $145 at time of writing, up nearly 19% in the last week. Launched a year ago, BUIDL uses traditional money market funds, which investors use to store cash in the near term and earn yield on it, combined with blockchain payment properties. Solana is now the seventh blockchain compatible with the tokenized money market fund BUIDL, after its initial launch on Ethereum. BlackRock’s technology partner, Securitize, says the fund is expected to exceed $2 billion in cash and Treasury bills by early April. Says Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, “We’re making [money market funds] unboring. We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” One benefit BUIDL offers over traditional money market funds is 24/7 trading. Says Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, “Our vision for why on-chain finance adds more value is because you can do more things with those assets on chain than you could if [they’re] sitting in your brokerage account.” BUIDL is part of BlackRock’s long-term digital asset strategy, which includes its spot-Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the future of finance includes the “tokenization of every financial asset.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Should We Compare Bitcoin to Gold? Lessons From the Last Financial Crisis

Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:53:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Rahul Kapoor and Lehigh University’s Natalya Vinokurova explain the risks associated with a common argument for investing in Bitcoin: comparing it to gold. Rahul Kapoor Rahul Kapoor, Natalya Vinokurova The following article was written by Wharton management professor Rahul Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova, associate professor of management at the College of Business at Lehigh University. Bitcoin is now priced at almost a hundred thousand dollars with a total market of almost two trillion dollars. A common argument promoting investment in Bitcoin compares it to gold — a time-tested store of value and a safe haven for generating significant investment returns. How credible is that analogy, and more importantly, what is the risk that comes with it? We are in a good position to address this issue. One of us has studied the development and adoption of technological innovations for more than two decades; the other has researched the connection between innovation, analogies, and financial crises. Let’s think about where the great financial crisis of 2008 came from. Investors accepted the analogy of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to bonds. MBS are a class of investments that entitle the investor to a fraction of cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages in the securities’ collateral. While MBS carried risks that were quite different from bonds (such as the systemic risk of a house price correction across the economy), they were rated by the same credit rating agencies as bonds. Consequently, even conservative investors such as pension funds were willing to invest in these new supposedly safe securities. However, the analogy masked several aspects of the financial system: leverage in the system, lack of transparency about which investors owned what, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and inadequate risk management tools. Combined, these factors turned MBS into the opposite of safe assets both for the investors holding them and the society at large. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. However, they almost always carry the risk of masking features that could be fundamentally important in the role that the innovation plays with respect to its intended use, resulting in unintended negative consequences, such as the financial crisis of 2008. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has been increasingly referred to as digital gold, emphasizing its modern digital nature as a store of value, with limited supply that is decentralized (not controlled by central banks) and operating on blockchain technology architecture. Accordingly, it has been pitched as a vehicle for investors enthusiastic about technology and seeking long-term financial gains that provide a hedge against inflation and are immune to economic cycles. Buyers and institutions are increasingly explaining their decision to invest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in terms of it being the new digital gold. For example, the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a Bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been “wrong” about Bitcoin and now believes Bitcoin is “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial instrument. State Street forecasts that cryptocurrency ETFs will surpass precious metal ETFs in North American assets by the end of 2025, becoming the third-largest asset class in the $15 trillion ETF industry. While the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, emphasized in marketing campaigns and expert commentaries, are appealing and reasonably uncontroversial, they mask some important differences concerning the structure of value and the nature of ownership. Unlike Bitcoin, gold has physical properties as a precious metal that are attractive for many applications, including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. In fact, it is estimated that more than half of the global gold reserve is used in such applications, with the rest held by central banks or private investors. Moreover, the quality of gold (with respect to the metal purity) can be ascertained through simple scientific tests. Accordingly, the structure of value for gold is much more tangible and transparent than that of Bitcoin. While gold has a history of holding its value in times of societal cataclysms such as wars, it is not clear that Bitcoin could survive a major power grid failure. The lack of transparency in the value structure of Bitcoin has led to speculative trading, involving individuals who don’t have the expertise necessary to understand the basis of value or critically evaluate the prospects of long-term returns. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and mortgage-backed securities suggest that history may be repeating itself. While the blockchain ledger provides a public database of Bitcoin ownership and transactions, there is little information about who owns what. This dearth of public and common knowledge about who owns Bitcoin is eerily reminiscent of the aftermath of the MBS crisis in which major financial institutions discovered — to their surprise — that they held the risk that they believed they had passed on to other players. Today, pension funds from Wisconsin, Michigan, the UK, and Australia have begun investing in Bitcoin, primarily through regulated U.S. ETFs. This move is driven by Bitcoin’s substantial value increase and a pro-crypto U.S. administration. This is a pattern that is quite similar to pension funds investing in MBS without fully understanding the risks. It has been estimated that a large majority of Bitcoins are owned by individual investors who own a small fraction of a single Bitcoin. This fragmentation and lack of transparency of ownership of a speculative asset presents systemic risk. The opaque structure of value, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and the willingness of major financial institutions to sell these arcane products to less sophisticated investors suggest that Bitcoin has more similarities with MBS than it has with gold. A critical ingredient of the 2008 mortgage crisis was the willingness of leaders of major financial institutions to go along with leveraged trading in securities that they did not understand due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next big thing. These are exactly the patterns we are seeing in Bitcoin trading today. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and MBS suggest that history may be repeating itself. In fact, the negative consequences of the analogy of Bitcoin to gold might be even more severe than the analogy of MBS to bonds. While most MBS at the end of the day were backed by real assets — mortgages on real houses — Bitcoin is not backed by any real assets. If you are not in the business of speculation, steering clear of investing in Bitcoin — or for that matter any cryptocurrency — may be the best way to avoid the fallout from another misguided analogy.

Title: BlackRock taps Solana for BUIDL tokenized fund as Bitcoin ETP debuts in Europe

BlackRock introduces Bitcoin ETP in Europe and integrates BUIDL to Solana in strategic blockchain embrace. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest investment firm in the world with over $11 trillion in assets under management, made two significant moves on March 25 to increase its presence in the crypto industry. The firm has extended its tokenized money market fund to the Solana blockchain and introduced its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in the European market. BlackRock has launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP across major European markets. According to the product’s website, the ETP will begin trading on March 25 on Germany’s Xetra exchange, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The product trades under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Paris and BTCN in Amsterdam. To encourage adoption, the ETP is debuting with a reduced fee of 0.15%, which will remain in effect until 2026. After that, the fees will increase to 0.25%, aligning with similar regional offerings. This launch follows the strong performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the US, which currently manages over $50 billion in assets. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based fund now holds approximately 2.9% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply. In a separate development, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is now live on Solana. This marks the seventh blockchain to support the fund, following earlier rollouts on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aptos, Polygon, and Optimism. Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for BUIDL, explained that it expanded the product to Solana because of the blockchain network’s fast transaction speeds and low network fees. Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said: “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” BUIDL tokenizes traditional money market funds, offering the benefits of blockchain-based settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts with conventional funds that operate within limited market hours. Currently, BUIDL manages over $1.7 billion in assets, primarily in cash and short-term US Treasury bills. Ethereum hosts the bulk of these holdings—over $1.5 billion—while the remaining assets are distributed across other supported blockchains. Aptos and Avalanche each hold around $53 million, followed by Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which have $33 million, $32 million, and $27 million, respectively.

A new €16 million dedicated women’s health centre is to open in Dublin in the autumn. The clinic will be run by Blackrock Health, which is the umbrella company formed by businessman Larry Goodman after he took full control of three of the best-known private hospitals in the State – Blackrock Clinic, Hermitage Clinic and Galway Clinic. The new facility, which will be called Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, will create 50 new jobs. The group said the centre will be the “most comprehensive” private, consultant-led women’s health centre of its kind in Ireland. Planning permission was granted for the facility in recent weeks. The clinic, which will be located at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2, will offer 340 outpatient appointments per day, and will provide access to a range of consultant-led and allied health services in an environment designed exclusively around the needs of women. The centre will offer consultant-led clinics in gynaecology, urology, breast health, endocrinology, gastroenterology, pain medicine, cardiology, dermatology, plastics and aesthetics, psychology and psychotherapy, health screening, and rheumatology. These services will be complemented by a full suite of allied health offerings, including physiotherapy, urodynamics, phlebotomy, and advanced radiology diagnostics including Dexa scanning, mammography, and ultrasound. Blackrock Health chief executive Dr Caroline Whelan said: “We understand the health concerns of the nation, how they have evolved and why now is the time to deliver care that is tailored to women. “That is why we are so proud to invest €16 million to open the Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, offering holistic care that treats the healthcare issues that are specific to women, specifically for women.” The investment by Blackrock Health is in addition to the €500 million investment announced in September. Blackrock Health employs more than 3000 staff and counts 600 consultants in 50 medical specialities on its books. Together, its hospitals have a total of 418 inpatient beds including 28 ICU beds and 22 operating theatres. Together, the group cared for more than 360,000 patients last year. Blackrock Health is part of Parma Health, a division of Mr Goodman’s Parma Group.

Title: If You’re in Crypto, Pivot to AI Now

For years, crypto’s positioned itself as the next great technological revolution. But as we witness the explosive rise of AI, it's time for crypto to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence, and crypto will play a supporting role rather than be the star. This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included. With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer. Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications. This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI. This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world. What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility. While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry. This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products. Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again: distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure. We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode. For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents. What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products. Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value. Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation. For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective (Vast.ai, a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years). Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain. In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy. The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail. Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate. For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI. The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact. The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself. If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

Title: Enormous Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 8 Years Of Dormancy As Another Scoops Up $200 Million In BTC

A Bitcoin whale wallet dating back to late 2016 woke up from dormancy after over eight years and moved 3,000 BTC in a single transaction. The reactivation coincides with a recent resurgence for the apex crypto. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $87,700 as of publication time, according to data provider CoinGecko. As BTC stages a relief rally on Tuesday amid talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being narrower than originally feared, a whale that has been asleep for 8 years is waking up this week. According to data from blockchain sleuth Arkham Intelligence, the whale has moved 3,000 Bitcoin, valued at $250 million at the time of the transfer. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today— and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote in a recent post on the X platform. The movement of BTC from very old wallets often sparks curiosity among crypto community members. In recent years, numerous dormant wallets have come out of hibernation only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also discovered to have shifted their BTC stashes to crypto exchanges, suggesting they were looking to take profits after many years of HODLing. Meanwhile, a billionaire Bitcoin whale is adding to their stockpile. Arkham pointed out in a different X post that the whale snatched up 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $200 million, on March 24. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale in question started buying Bitcoin only five days ago after selling its cache in February when the asset’s price was hovering at around $100K and $86K. Data from CoinGecko indicates that BTC was trading at around $104,000 on February 1 and plunged to $78K lows by the end of that month. Another massive BTC holder, BlackRock, has also been adding to its Bitcoin stockpile over the last week as well. Per Arkham data, the world’s largest asset manager with $11 trillion in assets under management, bought a further 4,054 Bitcoin across 15 separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to 573,878 BTC, or over $50 billion.

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has become available on Solana, Securitize announced, marking another step in the asset manager’s push into blockchain-based finance. The expansion makes BUIDL available on seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum and Optimism. Only 62 wallets currently hold BUIDL on-chain, however, according to rwa.zyz data. The fund, officially the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, combines a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries with the settlement and transfer capabilities of blockchain. Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April, according to Securitize. “In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, in a statement. “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Money market funds typically allow investors to earn interest on idle cash, but they come with trading limitations such as limited operating hours. Blockchain versions like BUIDL allow for constant access. BlackRock isn’t alone. Franklin Templeton offers a similar tokenized fund that currently has a $692 billion market capitalization and 558 holders, and Figure Markets recently launched YLDS, an interest-bearing stablecoin. Other major tokenized treasury funds include the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin (USYC) and Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing nearly sixfold over the past year and recently crossing $5 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show.

Share this article BlackRock, overseeing $11.6 trillion in client assets, is bringing its tokenized treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund, also known as BUIDL, to Solana, Fortune reported on March 25. The fund has attracted around $1.7 billion in assets under management since its launch, according to data from RWA.xyz. With this integration, Solana becomes the seventh supported chain for the BUIDL fund, which currently operates on Ethereum, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. The move comes after Franklin Templeton announced the launch of its money market fund, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, or FOBXX on Solana. Franklin’s tokenized treasury fund currently ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, only after BlackRock’s BUIDL and Hashnote’s USYC fund. The BUIDL fund operates 24/7, unlike traditional money market funds limited to business hours, providing crypto traders with a yield-generating alternative to non-interest-bearing stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Earlier this month, BUIDL became the first tokenized fund from a Wall Street institution to achieve the $1 billion milestone. A spokesperson for Securitize, which serves as the tokenization provider for BUIDL, expects the fund to exceed $2 billion in early April. “We’re making them unboring,” Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, told Fortune. “We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” Securitize announced January its integration with the Solana blockchain in January. The firm aims to expand the accessibility and adoption of tokenized real-world assets, and Solana’s technology provides the necessary infrastructure to support this goal. The expansion follows BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets, including its spot-Bitcoin ETF launch in January 2024, which has attracted nearly $40 billion according to crypto analytics firm SoSoValue. “ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC in January. “Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. 03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

BySarah Whitmire andForbes Daily BySarah Whitmire Forbes Staff andForbes Daily Forbes Staff. Whether the “R” word is on the horizon or not, troubling U.S. consumer data is beginning to pile up. Consumer sentiment is at a 15-month low, credit card delinquency is on the rise, and nearly half of U.S. adults don’t have three months of emergency savings. In such times, it could be tempting to dip into a retirement account—and there are a number of exemptions (both new and old) that will allow you to do so without paying a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Barring these exceptions, it’s wise to consider other options. Having to pay the penalty, plus tax on the distribution itself, can add up fast—and that’s without getting into lost gains from what you pull out. Check with a tax pro or benefits administrator to ensure you don’t make a poor financial situation worse. Stocks gained Monday on a reported tariff reprieve. Markets popped Monday on news that President Donald Trump would walk back previously announced reciprocal tariffs in key industries, driving a 1.8% lift on the S&P 500, a 1.4% increase for the Dow, and a 2.3% jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The most notable gainers were the “Magnificent Seven” big American technology stocks, including a near 12% surge for troubled EV maker Tesla. Trump is referring to the April 2 rollout of his reciprocal tariffs as “Liberation Day,” though he continues to express flexibility in his tariff plans. Semiconductors and cars will both be exempted from next week’s actions, for instance, and the president said he “may give a lot of countries breaks” and that his plans are “reciprocal, but we may be even nicer than that,” signaling the U.S. may not even match the tariff rates American goods face abroad. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Chuck Schumer was gearing up for a tour to promote his newly published book Antisemitism In America when his day job got in the way—the tour was postponed after the Senate minority leader faced backlash for supporting the Republican’s spending bill and avoiding a government shutdown. Still, this bump in the road won’t impact Schumer’s own bottom line much, as the career politician is worth about $7 million, Forbes estimates, a number built almost entirely on his Brooklyn condo and retirement savings. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Monday that “nobody was texting war plans” after The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief published an article saying he was accidentally added to a Signal group where top Trump Administration officials discussed plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen. Hegseth’s denial comes despite the National Security Council saying screenshots of the chat appeared “to be an authentic message chain,” as the defense secretary faces heavy backlash. The Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to throw out a district court ruling that required the government to reinstate probationary employees that were fired from six key agencies last month. The administration’s filing argues that “the lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch” employment decisions, and it comes after Trump officials have publicly criticized unfavorable rulings by district court judges. MORE: U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg rejected the Trump Administration’s separate request to throw out an order that barred the administration from deporting immigrants under an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling comes as reports emerge of migrants who were wrongly identified as gang members, and deported to El Salvador.

The New York Mets’ new outfielder Juan Soto and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani are set to collect an estimated $126.9 million and $102 million in 2025, respectively. They easily lead Forbes’ latest list of Baseball’s Highest-Paid Players, with the top 10 earners set to be paid a combined $576 million this year—a 25% increase from 2024’s record total. Social media giant X said the Turkish government has requested blocks on more than 700 accounts amid protests over the controversial arrest of Istanbul’s mayor—but the company called the request “unlawful,” adding that “X will always defend freedom of speech.” However, over the weekend, Politico Europe reported that X had already suspended a number of accounts in Turkey “belonging to opposition figures.” A government contractor and lobbyist who served in President Donald Trump’s first administration bought Vice President JD Vance’s Northern Virginia home for $1.9 million—about $170,000 over the asking price, according to government records and real estate listings. A spokesperson for the buyer said the offer was based solely on market factors, and that the purchase had no connection to the buyer’s government work or political ties. U.S. businesses no longer have to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting filing requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act. That’s the result of an interim final rule issued this month that removes the requirement for U.S. companies to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Previously, reporting requirements applied to businesses created in the U.S. and foreign companies registered to do business in any U.S. state or Indian tribe. If finalized, the rule would exempt more than 99% of entities from reporting. Beretta CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta For 14 generations, the Beretta family has sold firearms. While they’re known for handguns and shotguns, current CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta, a 15th-generation descendant of the Beretta founders, saw a more well-rounded future for the world’s oldest gunmaker. Since becoming CEO in 1995, Pietro has helped remake the 499-year-old company—which is still family-owned—by scooping up firms making everything from rifles to luxury clothing. In 2022, for instance, Beretta purchased Ammotec, Europe’s largest maker of ammunition and pyrotechnics, and added $600 million to their annual sales. It’s now the world’s largest firearms company with $1.7 billion in revenues in 2024. “The three legs of our business are hunters, soldiers and policemen. They need guns, clothing and optics,” he says, referring to scopes and red dot sights designed to improve a firearm’s aim. “The last piece we needed was ammunition. With this latest deal, we finally closed the circle.” Before the acquisition, civilian sales accounted for 86% of the company’s revenues, making it dependent on the whims of hunters and gun enthusiasts—particularly in the U.S., the world’s largest firearms market, which makes up 37% of Beretta’s sales. When Covid-19 sent gun sales to American civilians surging, Beretta reaped the rewards, with its North American revenues increasing by 62% from 2019 to 2021. But Pietro knew that would not last forever. Beretta took advantage of that growth in the U.S. civilian market to build closer ties with military and police forces around the world, helping the company “rebalance,” Pietro said. Now, defense and law enforcement sales make up 34% of Beretta Holding’s revenues, up from just 14% four years ago. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a smart time to bet on the military, Forbes’ Giacomo Tognini writes. Defense spending by European countries hit a record $350 billion in 2024 as leaders sought to rearm following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That’s set to grow even further, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan in March—right after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would pause military aid to Ukraine—to provide EU countries with $160 billion in loans to invest in their armed forces. MORE As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock A number of factors have led more American workers to take on multiple jobs, from the rising cost of living to an increasingly competitive job market. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that it sees the highest number of workers with multiple jobs since it began tracking the metric in 1994: 8.9 million: The number of Americans who now work multiple jobs 50.2%: The share of people holding multiple jobs in 2024 who have a college degree, up from 45.1% in 2019 34.1: The number of hours in an average workweek for employees on private nonfarm payrolls last month, down from 34.3 in February 2024, as some employers cut back on hours Student loan borrowers are in a difficult position, as the Trump Administration has taken a number of actions in the past months to upend repayment and loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should take steps now to stay ahead of the shifting landscape, including periodically logging into their Department of Education account and downloading key records, saving month-by-month payment records from their loan servicer account, and even reviewing their credit reports for possible errors as a result of the recent disruptions.

Title: French wealth management fintech RockFi garners €18m funding

Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:41:39Z

RockFi, a fintech company specialising in private wealth management, has raised €18m ($19.45m) in a Series A funding round led by Partech. The round also saw participation from existing investor Varsity and business angels, including Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser, co-founders of Pennylane, and Mark Ransford, former managing director of Apax UK. With this fresh capital, RockFi aims to fast-track its expansion and reach its target of managing €1bn in assets by the close of 2026. The company secured fresh funding less than a year after raising €3m in its initial fundraising round. Based in France, the fintech was established in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand—alongside former private banking executives such as Stéphane Carles (formerly of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (formerly of HSBC Gestion Privée). RockFi aims to transform private wealth management with its technology-driven platform and network of independent private bankers. The company serves a diverse clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, “top” athletes, and artists, offering a blend of human expertise and digital solutions for wealth management. Marin, who is also the CEO, said: “We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. “This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and – eventually – across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management.” RockFi said its family office approach provides clients with dedicated private advisors who craft comprehensive investment strategies covering financial investments, taxation, and estate planning. The platform offers 3,000 financial instruments across various asset classes, with an emphasis on private equity through partnerships with firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. The fintech’s proprietary technology platform is said to enable clients to access “real-time” asset tracking and analytics. Less than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi claims to have attracted 500 clients, achieving a monthly business growth of over 25%. The company has expanded its workforce to 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, across six offices in France. Over the next year, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month in cities such as Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. The company also plans to double its team of 12 engineers to enhance its monitoring and reporting capabilities. As part of the funding, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and general partner at Partech, is joining the board of directors. Collombel added: “We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model – combining a technological platform with human expertise – addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. “The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform.”

Title: Canada's Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/25/canadas-conservative-party-promises-to-cut-mass-economic-migration/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:12:16Z
Full Content:
Canada’s conservative leader wants to win the nation’s April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau’s replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians. The Conservative Party candidate is Pierre Poilievre. He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party. The two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy. In 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States. That huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians. It cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments. But the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy. However, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers. In the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist: I will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up. Poilievre also promised lower migration: I want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula. The numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people. That focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime. Poilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21. Wiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business: “We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow. In May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying: Larger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on. Wiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said: We look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. Mayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups. Since November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration. More Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.” Carney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians: But he is being forced to talk about immigration. On March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered: Yeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration. [But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor: I need an MRI to see if I have a fucking brain tumor. And go ahead, cuess what [date] it is? Go ahead. Guess! It is in 2026. 2026! … Cool. Canada, where healthcare is free, but only If you can afford to wait.

BlackRock (BLK), the global asset manager behind the largest U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe on Tuesday, its first crypto ETP outside North America. The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on Xetra and Euronext in Paris under the ticker IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN, according listing details on iShares' website. The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January. Although the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. at the start of 2024 was considered a watershed moment for the crypto industry, similar products have existed in Europe for several years as ETPs. Digital asset managers CoinShares and 21Shares have led the way, accounting for nine of the top 20 ETPs by assets between them, according to data tracked by ETFbook. CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP is the largest, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. Coinbase (COIN), which provides custody for IBIT, will do the same for the BlackRock's European product. The fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025. BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg. UPDATE (March 25, 11:34 UTC): Adds trading started in first paragraph, Canada ETF in third, European industry in fourth.
