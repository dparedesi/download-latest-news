Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship. AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services.

New to the strategy was the online food delivery platform and logistics provider DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) Since its IPO in 2021, the company’s scale has grown to entrench it with customers and consumers, though we have been cautious about its high valuation. Recently, the company reported lower-than-expected guidance for future margins and that caused its shares to sell off. In our view, DoorDash was appropriately investing for future growth and absorbing recent increased wage costs. Believing this short-term price dislocation made for an attractive entry price, we began buying, and DoorDash was up 2% through the end of the quarter.” Overall, DASH ranks 3rd on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Building a Bond Ladder Barry Ritholtz: Over the past decade, or maybe even longer, No one’s accurately predicted which way rates were going. Are they going to rise? Are they going to fall? Are they going to stay steady? This creates a challenge for bond investors who are usually looking for a predictable income stream from their fixed-income holdings. One solution? Create a ladder of bonds of different maturity rates so that regardless of what occurs, you have a predictable yield series. You can lock in higher-yielding paper if rates fall, but you also free up more capital on an annual basis if rates rise, I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to show you how to create a bond ladder. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your fixed income portfolio, let’s bring in Karen Veraa. She is head of iShares US fixed income strategy for investing giant black rock. So let’s start simply by What is a bond ladder? Karen Verra: A bond ladder is a simple tool for investing in the bond market. You take your investing window, let’s say 10 years, and you equally wait every maturity across that 10 year period. So you’ve got bonds that mature in one year, two year, three years, and so on. It’s a very popular strategy because as you just mentioned, Barry, you, you don’t have to make bets on interest rate risk. You kind of have your investing horizon and you’ve got this more predictable stream of income as well as maturity is coming due each year where you can make a decision about. Going in the next rung on the bond ladder or doing something else with that money. Barry Ritholtz: We always seem to divide bond ladders into each rung is the same equity amount. What, what’s the thinking there? Karen Verra: We do see that as being the most popular. It’s because you can think through that. I’m going to have a certain amount of money. Let’s say I’ve got a hundred thousand dollars to invest and it’s a 10 year-ladder. I’ve got 10, 000 coming due each year. You can kind of think of it in chunks like that. We do see some people, who are laddering out amounts and retirement accounts, and they need to take those required minimum distributions where they will look at the IRS schedule of how much they have to pull out of the account. It’s not quite equal, but you can even ladder out those required minimum distributions. Um, you know, it’s about 8 percent instead of 10 percent in the first year, for example. And then you don’t have to sell anything inside your retirement account and you can just pull those out on schedule. So that’s another way that people weight their bond ladders when they’re seeking that goal of having those RMDs coming due every year. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what goes into bond ladders. I’m assuming a mix of US Treasury bonds, munis, investment grade corporates, even high yielding. Anything else go into the mix for bond ladders? Karen Verra: I’d say the most popular tends to be munis and corporate bonds and the investment grade side. We offer a suite of exchange traded funds that mature each year and they’re primarily used to build bond ladders. We have these in high yield as well for people who want to go out and add a little bit more income and credit risk to the portfolios. We even have them in the tips market. So these days you can build a bond ladder using all these different asset classes. I think some of the challenges with CDs is typically they’re limited in their term. They may only go out up to five years and sometimes the banks will have restrictions or penalties if you want to sell them early or try to get your money back early. So we’ve seen people migrate away from CD ladders, doing it more with bond and bond ETFs to build these ladders. Barry Ritholtz: How do investors determine what their timeline is? I think that’s a pretty interesting choice and most people just seem to assume it’s 10 years, but from what I’ve seen, there are a variety of timelines. Karen Verra: I think people can think about it if they have a liability that they’re managing to or a time based goal. Uh, we see people sometimes building ladders, let’s say three to seven years because maybe they have a cash portfolio for things the next couple of years, but then they don’t want to start their ladder out for a few years. One to five tends to be the most popular, um, based on data that we have around assets and those different account types. We rarely see people go out past 10 years. I do see people asking for 15 because I think with the bond ladder, you can accomplish most of your goals within that time horizon of having stability, having income, rolling it every year. We also see on the corporate side, corporate issues will issue 10-year bonds and they might do a 30-year bond, but there’s not really that much paper that’s actively being issued beyond 10 years. So what tends to happen is there’s just not that many new issues and it’s hard to find the bonds. So I think that’s another reason why that 10 year point tends to be the maximum for most people’s ladders. Barry Ritholtz: We never know what yields will be in the future. How can an investor lock in the best yields on the duration curve today and benefit over the next decade with their ladders? Karen Verra: Well, we do have an inverted yield curve right now. So we’ve seen a lot of people overweighting their ladders in that one to two year bucket trying to maximize income. Maybe they do might do an extra, you know, 40, 50 percent than what they would usually do. But I think one of the nice things you can do now is. Try to lock in the yields for the interim. We’ve been telling people on the corporate side, you can get about 5 percent by continuing to go out, 6 to 7 percent for high yield. And so we’re seeing people who are doing that right now, knowing that when the fed starts to cut rates, interest rates are going to come down and they want to put some of that cash to work and consistently be getting four, five, six percent, rather than have it dissipate, um, in those short term vehicles as soon as interest rates go down. Barry Ritholtz: I continue to see people who are waiting for inflation to re-accelerate. They’re warning that the Fed is, is looking at this incorrectly and that we should be expecting much higher yields. If that were to happen, didn’t someone who just set up a bond ladder lock in low rates or how does the ladder work in the face of that? Karen Verra: So when I think about the ladder, it’s going to be a more known investment result than some other more perpetual bond strategies. So you kind of know what your yield is going to be over that period. You can do a few things. You could use TIPs. So we have for example, tips, term maturity, ETFs, tips I bonds where you, you can get protected for the inflation. But you also have the periodic income payments kicking off the ladder that you can reinvest at higher yields, which will add income over time. And you also have that discrete point when something matures this year, you can go and grab more income. So what we see is as yields go up, you’re slowly walking that ladder up and, and recouping more of the income over time. Barry Ritholtz: What about the opposite group of prognosticators, the ones who have been forecasting a recession every year for the past three years that just hasn’t shown up? If there’s a recession and rates fall pretty radically, what happens then? What’s our reinvestment risk there? Karen Verra: So if you’ve got your ladder locked in at today’s yields and yields come down, that ladder income stream is worth more. So we’ll actually see the prices on the bonds go up in that situation. But then you’re right. When the money comes to, you’re going to be reinvesting at lower rates. And then over time that will, will get go down a bit. If you are worried about a recession, I would say, go up in quality, stick to treasuries, investment grade, the higher quality, even munis, the higher quality asset classes that you don’t have to worry about as much default risk and volatility if we do have a coming recession. Barry Ritholtz: I know you’re the strategist for iShares, which issues a lot of ETFs. When I first started in the 1990s, bond ladders were all individually owned papers and separately managed accounts. Everything was hand-selected. The minimums were pretty high. The cost structure was pretty high. The state of the art stayed that way for decades. It seems to have gotten a whole lot better, cheaper, faster, easier today. Tell us, what is the state of the art building a bond ladder using ETFs? Karen Verra: I think this is one of the innovations that has really come about in the last decade. No longer do you have to have a million dollars to create a bespoke bond ladder with an SMA manager. You can do it today for very little amounts of money. And so what we’ve seen is our I bonds have been popular inside smaller account sizes. If you’ve got, you know, a one-off account over here, or even if you have a lot of money, it’s just a very efficient way to do that. So our I bonds ETFs are term maturity ETFs. They have a maturity date, typically each December and they’re holding bonds that mature throughout the calendar year. And then when the last bond matures, The ETF will delist from the exchange and you’ll have cash hitting your account, just like a bond maturity. And we’ve got them now in treasuries, tips, munis investment grade and high yield. So five different sectors of the bond market. And then we’ve seen people really customize things for their income needs for their tax status. And they’re, they’re getting exposed to hundreds of bonds in a single ETF, as opposed to what we see with a lot of SMAs – is they might be limited to maybe 20 to 30 bonds at the most. So you’re getting diversification at a very low cost. And because they are exchange traded, if you change your mind and want to sell them, you can at any point where a lot of times with a bond, it’s really easy to buy it, but then maybe when you go to sell it, it’s hard to find a buyer or there’s large transaction costs associated with that. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m hearing diversification, lower costs, liquidity, you mentioned they all, the ETF will mature at the end of the year, so you have a defined maturity, obviously no callable bonds go into that. But it seems working with an ETF gives you – I’m doing a little bit of a commercial here, but my firm uses a lot of ETFs, we’re very happy with them, you get a lot of flexibility and professional management – this really seems to be much better than the bad old days when someone was handpicking dozens of individual bonds. Karen Verra: We still see people who are preferring that, let’s say you have special, you’re in a high-tech state and you want a special SMA dedicated to that. So we see people even using our iBonds alongside SMAs or alongside other strategies. Or maybe they’re whittling those down. Like we don’t tell people go out and sell your bond portfolio. You’re curated over decades. However, this is a great strategy, I think, to provide some liquidity, diversification, and low cost access to these different parts of the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: One of the advantages of working with various large firms like yourself, iShares, Fidelity, Schwab, whoever. You have a variety of online tools to build your own bond ladder. Tell us a little bit about what people can find if they want to just do it themselves. Karen Verra: If you go to iShares.com backslash iBonds, you’ll find our landing page and there’s a link to our iBonds ladder tool. And we designed this to be just like a report that you would get if you went to a bond manager and asked for a bond ladder, you can input your dollar amount, you can check the box on which sectors of the bond market you want to be invested in, and there’s even a slider where you can look at your maturities. And right away, it will give you an equal-weighted ladder. You can then customize that ladder. If you’d like, you can delete things you don’t want, and it will have some summary characteristics, the number of bonds, the duration, the yield, the cost, and I think it’s a, it’s a great way to just visualize those yields. Like we have people who will come in and they want to know what different Maturities of the bond market are yielding. They can go in and look in, see where the treasury curve is, the investment grade curve, the high yield curve. And I think it’s just a great source of information to even go in and see what the different parts of the market are yielding. Barry Ritholtz: So to sum up, investors that are looking for yield but are concerned about interest rates going up, down, and all over the place can solve for that problem by creating a ladder of bond ETFs, spreading it out over five to 10 years. So their interest rate risk is reduced. They’re locking in rates now and if rates go higher as things mature, they can reinvest it. And if rates go down, hey, well, at least you locked in a higher rate for the first half of that, um, of those investments. It seems to make a lot of sense and especially if you’re working towards a specific liability or a specific goal, uh, where you have an obligation down the road, this allows you with very little risk to hit those targets. Karen Verra: That’s right. We, we’re seeing. all kinds of investors using them for, for different goals and objectives, different, different terms. And I think it really empowers people to do it themselves and invest in the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you, Karen. This has been really interesting. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Is The Future Of BCI Right Under Our Nose?

Neurotech startup Augmental has raised a $4m seed round to commercialize their wearable interface for people living with motor impairment and limited hand function. The “MouthPad” offers an unprecedented and convenient alternative to a brain-computer interface, or BCI, that circumvents the need for brain surgery by enabling users to control a mouse cursor using their tongue, breaths, head gestures, and soon, voice. Augmental's MouthPad, a new kind of interface that enables hands-free control of digital devices. It’s the brainchild of two engineers, Tomás Vega and Corten Singer, who met as undergraduates at Berkeley and reunited in Cambridge to found the company at the tail end of Vega’s graduate work at MIT in 2019. Over the pandemic, they formed Augmental and relocated to San Francisco, where they recently upgraded their garage-based R&D hub for a new office space that includes a clean room for commercial-grade manufacturing and distribution. The novel form factor belies Augmental’s importance to the future of neurotech markets. Their progress over the coming years represents a crystal ball for the success or failure of companies like Neuralink, Synchron, and many others in the crowded field of implantable BCI. To understand why, let’s look at product functionality, the state of the market, and the growing, global commercial ecosystem in BCI. Augmental operates under a banner known as “Assistive Technologies.” AT includes tools to help with typing, speech, smart home functionality, as well as wheelchairs, semi autonomous robots, prosthetic or robotic limbs and some stimulation devices. Estimates vary but analysts have pegged this at a $20 billion annual market opportunity that is growing quickly as our technophile society ages. New Mobility recently published a close-up on several AT tools, and included both the MouthPad and its early impact on end user Keely Horch, a 19 year old living with quadriplegia. From the article: “The MouthPad embeds a tiny touchpad in a dental-safe resin retainer, Bluetooth-enabled, for the tongue to manipulate like a finger would. At first it was a challenge grasping the relationship between tongue, touchpad and screen, but now Horch forgets the device is even in her mouth and uses it for five hours a day, controlling her cell phone and more easily editing the papers she dictates with voice recognition, which works alongside the MouthPad without a hitch. Settings are customizable, and she right-clicks by drawing air through her lips: It’s sip-and-puff without the straw.” Each MouthPad is custom-printed based on dental scans from a national network of over 90 partnered centers across the US. Augmental’s operation is becoming scalable now, after three years of working closely with nearly 100 people living with various disabilities such as spinal cord injury and neuromuscular disorders to design and develop a product that works intuitively. Investors backing the vision include SCI Ventures, Murata, Revere Partners, LivEdge Capital, Fen, Carao and Tesserakt, as well as individuals from Andreseen Horowitz’s Scout Fund and a group of Angel Investors that include notable consumer electronics experts such as Eric Migicovsky and Nirav Patel, as well as Neuralink’s Head of Next Gen, Joey O’Doherty. Horch, an engineering sophomore in college, uses the MouthPad to play games with her brothers and participate in class, stating, “I was able to unmute myself and raise my hand and type questions up…I was able to use different software, like graphing, and it was really helpful for visualizing things.” Analysts are confident that BCI will be a $400 billion market in 20 years, but they can’t measure how much digital autonomy is worth today for people who can’t move their hands. Augmental’s users who can move their head and neck can use head-tracking for cursor control, and perform clicks and other gestures with tongue movements. Those with more limited mobility can use tongue gestures alone for cursor control, clicks, swipes, etc. How does the Mouthpad compare to implanted BCI? With a pricepoint in the low four figures (currently $1,500 through the company’s early-access program) it is a magnitude of order more affordable than the estimated range of $30,000 to $60,000 for implanted BCI. Moreover, by circumventing surgery of any sort, users avoid possible complications, from infections to difficulties upgrading the device. Critically, the functionality is comparable. Vega shared that their “Bits Per Second” test, which is one technical measure of controlling a mouse cursor with BCI, clocks in at 7.85 BPS for their top-performing quadriplegic user. Compare this to 9.51, which was Neuralink user Noland Arbaugh’s top score at the time of this writing. Most importantly, the device is available for use today. 2024 represents a breakout year for Augmental. In addition to their seed round and new office, they have crossed $100k in direct sales, published user testimonials and brought on world-class engineers and experts to expand the range of actions available to MouthPad users, including building a voice-based UI for whisper speech, and eventually fully silent speech. Moving forward, the question is not whether the MouthPad is capable of helping people. It’s how Augmental can scale growth until qualifying their device for insurance reimbursement, which would expand access to hundreds or thousands of people seeking greater digital autonomy. The complexity of delivering affordable innovations into “the disability market” cannot be understated. As Augmental navigates the broken roads experienced by people living with serious motor impairment, they’ve entered the cottage industry of AT. Finding Reimbursement for novel devices involves a whack-a-mole quest through departments of rehabilitation, vocational programs, state Medicaid offices, county level disability support offices, and the like. Despite the challenges, the number of Mouthpad users has grown to 50, with as many devices in production. MouthPad users live across 28 states, and the waitlist for the device has surpassed 3,000 people. In the background, the company is pursuing a submission to the FDA for virtual control of electronic wheelchairs, which would qualify them for CMS reimbursement down the road. Meanwhile they are helping candidates access grant funding to pay for MouthPads and have forged alliances with nonprofits to promote and sponsor device purchase. Augmental is planning an in-house team to develop and cultivate relationships with these key institutions to broaden onramps to access by meeting patients in existing communities nationwide. One such nonprofit is BCI Pioneer Ian Burkhart’s foundation, which has sponsored a handful of MouthPads for users in Ohio. In April, Burkhart, who was implanted with a research version of Blackrock’s interface in a clinical trial that ran from 2014 to 2021, shared his experience of navigating health coverage and income caps for disability programs with The Atlantic: “The salary (an end-user would) have to make to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is much more than most jobs pay. A lot of people don’t have the opportunity to make such a giant leap. The system is set up to force you to live in poverty.” An affordable, risk-free BCI could change the conversation around value and productivity. What if enabling success in the classroom or the workplace is comparable to the cost of a new phone, rather than a new car? For now, philanthropy represents a stop-gap to drive access. It makes sense then, that SCI Ventures, born from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and operating as a strategic venture philanthropy, led Augmental’s seed round. In a conversation with me this summer, SCI Venture’s Managing Partner Adrien Cohen described Augmental’s approach as “extremely elegant,” adding “I’ve seen the impact it’s had on users' autonomy and independence. In a few minutes, you’re controlling your laptop, using your phone without assistance, without a caretaker. It’s a mindblowing innovation that needs to exist in the world.” The challenging opportunities facing Vega, Singer, and their team of ten engineers and designers could reveal several promising paths for Augmental in the coming months: What’s in it for the BCI companies? It comes down to competitive strategy. In a recent article, Burkhart, Jen French, and colleagues discuss the opportunities and gaps in building Assistive Technology. These include co-development of products and standards designed with end-users in mind. Beyond calling for tech companies to do the right thing by engaging people with lived experiences (including those who might not be eligible for implantation), they call for closer consideration of how inclusive design could attract cause-driven funders and improve adoption of frontier technologies, while facilitating scale-up through crowdsourcing. There are many BCI companies emerging, but few functional wearable control interfaces out there, ready to use and scale today. So, where can commercial leaders and investors find a revenue-generating, low-risk market opportunity to help people living with disability today, while generating unique insights on user preferences, habits, requirements, limitations, and ideas that could differentiate BCI roadmaps and strategy?

Title: Bitcoin Going to $200K by 2025 Is a ‘Conservative’ Estimate, Says Global Asset Manager Bernstein

Analysts at Bernstein, a leading research and brokerage firm that is a subsidiary of global investment firm AllianceBernstein (AB), have reportedly described their Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by the end of 2025 as “conservative.” They urged those skeptical about cryptocurrency to reconsider its potential, particularly given the rising U.S. debt levels. According to a report by James Hunt for The Block, Gautam Chhugani, who leads Bernstein’s digital assets division, sent a note to clients on Wednesday stating, “Bitcoin is on track to reach $200,000 by the end of this cycle, projected for 2025. We consider this a conservative estimate.” The forecast follows the recent release of Bernstein’s “Bitcoin Blackbook,” which is aimed at guiding institutional investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Legendary Research Broker Bernstein Has Just Published One of its Famed "Black Books" on #Bitcoin!160 Pages Explaining Why BTC Will Hit $200k by the end of 2025 and How Listed #Bitcoin Miners Will Continue to Consolidate the Industry. @gautamchhugani 👏 pic.twitter.com/lDnAvWeYIe Chhugani pointed out that, in a world where the U.S. national debt now stands at $35 trillion and inflationary risks persist, Bitcoin’s scarcity as a digital asset offers strong appeal as a “store of value.” He added that those who view gold as a solid investment should find Bitcoin an even more compelling option. For investors looking for indirect exposure to Bitcoin, Chhugani suggested considering companies like MicroStrategy, which holds the largest amount of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, and Robinhood, which is growing its crypto offerings. Chhugani also pointed to the potential of U.S.-based firms such as Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which are amassing significant energy capacity for Bitcoin mining. He noted that Core Scientific is leveraging its resources for both AI hosting services and Bitcoin mining, tapping into the growing demand for AI infrastructure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $66,349, down 0.7% in the past 24-hour period. The BTC price is down 9.5% from its all-time high of around 10% from an all-time high of roughly $73,737 set on 14 March 2024, but up 58.31% in the year-to-date period. On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, citing the increasing backing from institutional investors. Coutts highlighted a notable change in asset allocation preferences, driven by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public support for Bitcoin. He pointed out that BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, widely used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for portfolio modeling, now integrates Bitcoin seamlessly via its ETF. This, Coutts argued, has cleared the way for Bitcoin’s price to rise significantly. He predicted that even a small reallocation of institutional investments from traditional assets like sovereign bonds to Bitcoin could see BTC surpass $500,000 by the end of the decade. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: Caelan Doris confirmed as captain as Ireland’s squad for Autumn Series is named
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/23/caelan-doris-confirmed-as-captain-as-irelands-squad-for-autumn-series-is-named/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T13:22:44Z
Full Content:
And so it has come to pass. If historians ever come to revisit Andy Farrell’s squad announcement for the 2024 Autumn Nations Series its most notable aspect will probably be the passing of the baton as captain to Caelan Doris. He was only conferred as Leinster captain last month but he already looked like a prospective Lions king. Allowing for the Peter O’Mahony interregnum for last season’s Six Nations, and a deserving promotion it was too for someone who captained Munster for a decade, Ireland rugby teams have tended to have a go-to leader for the duration of World Cup cycles. Brian O’Driscoll was the captain for the 2007 and 2011 cycles, to be followed by Paul O’Connell (2012-15), Rory Best (2016-19) and Johnny Sexton (2020-23). Now we are entering the Doris era, and at 26 who is to say for how long. But certainly up until the 2027 World Cup in the USA and potentially beyond looks probable. One always had the impression that Farrell identified Doris as captain for this cycle quicker than the player himself did, and that being the modest type he is, Doris didn’t particularly aspire to the role. Farrell’s thinking was evident from the second round of last season’s Six Nations, when he named Doris captain ahead of James Ryan in the absence of O’Mahony. His thinking is entirely understandable, for whether or not Doris becomes a great orator in time, he leads by deed and, if fit and well, is a world-class player and is one of the first names on the team sheet. Perhaps the first. Doris also has an aura or presence about him, and just because his anointment was inevitable doesn’t make it any less of a landmark. Especially so in a largely predictable reprise of the 35-man squad initially named for last summer’s two-Test tour to South Africa save for five changes, all injury related. Where Dan Sheehan was one of the three hookers then, only to be replaced by Dave Heffernan, after his ACL injury in the first Test, now the Connacht man is named alongside Rónan Kelleher and Rob Herring. Despite both being sidelined, the expectation clearly is that Herring, and at a push Kelleher, will be fit for the opening game against the All Blacks. With Oli Jager injured, the other five props are retained, while the fit-again Iain Henderson is added to the other locks. Having been ruled out of the South African tour, Jamison Gibson-Park returns at the expense of Nathan Doak. The other two changes see the return of the Mack, in the guise the fit-again Hansen, and Hugo Keenan, after his secondment to the Ireland Olympic Sevens squad. The injured Jordan Larmour and Jimmy O’Brien miss out, as does the unlucky Jack Conan. Hence Cian Prendergast and the uncapped Cormac Izuchukwu are retained, as is the former’s brother Sam, who is the only other uncapped player. Farrell has an eye for prospective Test match players, witness the unhesitating promotion of Gibson-Park to the matchday 23 even when he was ostensibly number two at Leinster, and likewise Joe McCarthy, Hansen and Jamie Osborne, not least as a fullback. Although Farrell’s thinking at outhalf appears to have influenced Leinster this season, he doesn’t tell the provinces what to do, he shows them. Perhaps in part because of the increasing logjam at Leinster given Frawley’s conversion to 10 and the emergence of Sam Prendergast in addition to Ross and Harry Byrne, it almost seemed as if this season’s Emerging Ireland tour was devised more for the younger Prendergast sibling than any other player. He started all three games, was given his head in organising the team’s attacking play and received effusive praise from the stand-in head coach Simon Easterby, who will deputise for Farrell again in the Six Nations when Ireland seek a historic three titles in a row. Given Izuchukwu was also on both the senior tour and Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa, it seems reasonable to deduce that Farrell and Easterby also admire the athletic Ulster backrower, whose emergence may have happened sooner but for injuries. It therefore also seems reasonable to speculate that both Izuchukwu and Prendergast are being earmarked for Test debuts in this window, with the third game against Fiji looking like an ideal opportunity to do so. The absence of the unlucky Jack Conan again, after he suffered a hamstring injury in Leinster’s win over Munster and the likely absence of O’Mahony, until halfway through the window, reduces Farrell’s options in the backrow. For the opening game against the All Blacks, the likelier ploy is move Tadhg Beirne to blindside in accommodating Ryan and McCarthy in the secondrow, as in the second Test win over the Springboks, or picking two from those three at lock and start Ryan Baird in the backrow. Ciarán Frawley is putting pressure on Jack Crowley, but despite his mixed start to the season with Munster he is likely to be retained alongside the returning Gibson-Park. Bundee Aki’s extra sharpness and fitness could see him start against the All Blacks alongside Garry Ringrose, while the back three looks more competitive with the return of Hansen, Keenan, and not to mention the sight of Jacob Stockdale back to his attacking best. While he has earned some game time in this window, his problem is that James Lowe has become such an integral part of the team with his hefty left boot, physicality, offloading and finishing. Then there’s Osborne, outstanding at fullback in both Tests in South Africa and excellent for Leinster at inside centre this season, form and versatility which will be hard to resist in the matchday squad against the All Blacks. As well as an eye for prospective internationals, Farrell places great store by loyalty, with O’Mahony named despite being restricted to just 23 minutes of Munster’s URC round three fixture. There are also places for the other two current centurions, scrumhalf Conor Murray and Cian Healy as one of five props. Healy can, of course, also cover hooker in an emergency, an invaluable commodity in the modern era. Currently on 131 caps, Healy is thus in line to equal and perhaps surpass O’Driscoll’s all-time Irish record of 133 caps. Forwards (19): Ryan Baird (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht), Tadhg Beirne (Munster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt), Tadhg Furlong (Leinster), Cian Healy (Leinster), Dave Heffernan (Connacht), Iain Henderson (Ulster), Rob Herring (Ulster), Cormac Izuchukwu (Ulster), Rónan Kelleher (Leinster), Joe McCarthy (Leinster), Peter O’Mahony (Munster), Tom O’Toole (Ulster), Andrew Porter (Leinster), Cian Prendergast (Connacht), James Ryan (Leinster), Nick Timoney (Ulster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster).

October 23, 2024 By Neenah Payne Downfall of The Legacy Media shows that the legacy media is rapidly declining because it lost the trust of many Americans. It failed to report accurately on so many issues including the Biden laptop, January 6, the open southern border, COVID, and the injuries and deaths caused by the COVID shots. That failure woke up a lot of folks who now rely on the Alt Media for reliable information. COVID-19 also woke up a lot of people including the following: 1 – Dr. Robert Malone was the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots. Dr. Malone recommended against the use of the mRNA technology because it could not be used safely. So, when the mRNA Covid shots were released, he assumed the safety issue had been resolved. He got the shot which caused him many severe problems.However, Dr. Malone is now the President of the Global COVID Summit of 17,000 doctors and has gone around the world since 2020 frequently speaking in opposition to the COVID shots and globalization. He is the author of the 2022 book Lies My Gov’t Told Me: And the Better Future Coming. Dr. Malone is the Medical Director of The Unity Project, a group of 300 organizations across the US standing against mandated COVID vaccines for children.MRNA Inventor Says To Stop COVID “Vaccines” Now shows that when Dr. Malone was interviewed on 6/24/22 by Del Bigtree, host of The Highwire in mRNA PIONEER RAISES COVID VACCINE CONCERNS, Dr. Malone called for an immediate halt to the COVID shots. mRNA VACCINE INVENTOR CALLS FOR STOP OF COVID VAX says, “Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine, sits down with Del to give his honest concerns about why this is the wrong technology to use against #Covid19 and, in particular, the extreme danger it poses to young people.” The Physicians Declaration Calls COVID Policies “Crimes Against Humanity” shows that Dr. Malone read the petition against the COVID shots signed by more than 5,200 doctors. On a trip to Europe, Dr. Malone met Dr. Mattias Desmet, a psychologist, a statistician, and a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium who is the author of the 2022 book The Psychology of Totalitarianism. In Mattias Desmet about Mass Formation and modern society, Tucker Carlson explained that during his interview on the Joe Rogan show #1757 on 12/30/21, Dr. Malone introduced Prof. Desmet’s theory of “Mass Formation” (psychosis) to explain mass compliance with the absurd COVID policies. Desmet says loneliness is the root cause of group think because compliance gives people a sense of belonging. Why Joe Rogan’s Interviews on Mass Psychosis “Broke The Internet” explains that on The Highwire show EPISODE 249: BREAKING MASS PSYCHOSIS on 1/7/22, Bigtree explained that Dr. Peter McCullough on December 18 and Dr. Malone on January 3 discussed the concept of “mass psychosis” on the Joe Rogan show. That sent an overwhelming number of viewers to the internet searching for more information to understand how COVID has been used to drive Americans crazy with fear. Del explained that in WHAT IS MASS FORMATION PSYCHOSIS? IS THE PUBLIC BEING GASLIT? . Kim Iversen showed on January 5 that the term “mass formation psychosis” trended on so many searches over the weekend that it “broke the internet”! When Google censored the information, she went to DuckDuckGo and found that the term came from Joe Rogan’s December 31 interview with Dr. Malone. COVID Mass Psychosis: Causes and Solutions discusses the situation further. Joe Rogan Video Banned from YouTube explains that YouTube censored the episode and it is no longer available! Why Doesn’t Google Want You to Know About ‘Mass Formation Psychosis’? Dr. Malone met former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd in Maui and introduced him to the world. Dowd is the author of Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022 and 2023 and has since been widely interviewed. Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that Dowd discussed shocking excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history”. 2 – Dr. Brett Weinstein initially wore masks during COVID. However, Game-Changing Tucker Carlson Interview! shows that when he spoke with Carlson in February 2024, he had become part of the “Dream Team” fighting “Goliath”! In Joe Rogan Experience #2198 Bret Weinstein on 9/4/24, Dr. Weinstein discussed Rescue The Republic – Join The Resistance which he had helped organize to save the West. It was held on The Mall in Washington, DC on September 29. 3 – Dr. Naomi Wolf: Shocking New Book: The Pfizer Papers discusses the 2024 book The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity by New York Times best-selling author Dr. Naomi Wolf. In The Crime of “Talking to Tucker Carlson”, Dr. Wolf explains how COVID woke her up and how that alienated her from much of her family and friends on the Left. 4 – World-renowned British cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malholtra recommended the COVID shot for his father and took it himself. However, when his very healthy father suddenly died at age 73, Dr. Malholtra came to the conclusion that it was because of the COVID shot. Documentary: First Do No Pharm! links to the new film by Dr. Malholtra. The documentary examines the vast amount of fraud in medical research designed to benefit big pharma at the expense of humanity. The following former Democrats have awakened and have left the Democratic Party. 1 – Mikki Willis is the filmmaker who released Plandemic 1 in 2020 which has been seen by over 1 billion people worldwide although social medial blocked it. Willis followed that with Plandemic 2: InDoctor Nation and Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening. See the Plandemic series. Willis is the author of the 2021 book Plandemic: Fear Is the Virus. Truth Is the Cure. Wills was an avid supporter of Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders until he realized Sanders is not a socialist, but a communist. 2 – Del Bigtree, was an Emmy award-winning member of The Doctors TV show for five years who produced 30 episodes He quit to produce the film Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe which went viral in 2016. Bigtree is now the host of The Highwire which airs online Thursdays from 2-4 ET with an audience of 30 million in six nations. Bigtree says his parents were hippies who still support the Democratic Party. However, he says he now feels politically marooned because the Democratic Party of today no longer supports the values it held when he was growing up.Now is the MOST Important Moment In Human History w/ Del Bigtree 3 – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his candidacy for the US presidency in 2023, running as a “Kennedy Democrat” to align with the values of the Democratic party of his uncle President John Kennedy in 1963 and father Robert F. Kennedy who served as Attorney General and ran for the presidency in 1968. In 2024, RFK Jr. joined Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign with a pledge to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA). Trump Adopts RFK Jr.’s War on Junk Food to Win Over His Fans. See Kennedy’s Plan To Restore America’s Health. 4 – Tulsi Gabbard: Are Democrats Waging War on America Now? explains that Tulsi Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress from 2019-2021 and ran for the presidency in 2019 as a Democrat. Tulsi’s 2024 book: For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind explains why she left the party in 2022 to become an independent. Yesterday, Gabbard announced that she is joining the Republican Party! Politico: Gabbard says what everyone knows National Review: Tulsi Gabbard Joins Republican Party, ‘The Party of Common Sense’ Time: A Brief History of Tulsi Gabbard’s Evolution—From Democratic ‘Star’ to MAGA Republican My Big Announcement at Donald Trump’s NC Rally 10/22/24 For independent-thinkers like myself, there is no home in the Democrat Party. However, there is a home for us in the Republican Party. The Republican Party of warmongering elite Dick Cheney is in the past. Trump’s GOP is a big open tent party of the people, equality, commonsense, and the party that is led by a President who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. Tonight I stood with President Trump and announced I am joining the Republican Party. President Trump is our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. Now is the time for us to stand together, vote for Trump and save our country. Neenah Payne writes for Activist Post Top image: Katie Horton/YouTube Become a Patron!

Title: Could AI Help Employers Make Strides In Workplace Gender Equality?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/23/could-ai-help-employers-make-strides-in-workplace-gender-equality/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Punnam Raju Manthena, Co-Founder & CEO at Tekskills Inc. Partnering with clients across the globe in their digital transformation journeys. The gender gap in the workplace remains a key business and economic issue. Back in 2015, a McKinsey report found that reducing the gender gap could add about $12 trillion to $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. In 2024, the chief economist for the World Bank stated that closing the gender gap "could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%." For years, business leaders have been called on to deal with gender equality as an economic need and fundamental right, but progress is still stalled. According to findings from BlackRock, companies "with the most diverse workforces outperformed their country and industry group peers with the least-diverse workforces in terms of return on assets." Businesses with about 30% women in senior positions are 15% more profitable, as per the Victorian Government. This same report found that Australia's GDP would go up by 11% if the gender gap closed. All these point to a serious need for gender equality. So, not only is gender equality beneficial to business and society but equally importantly, gender inequality is detrimental to both. But, as an employer, how do you move toward gender equality? Can AI, the supposed game changer in the IT industry, help gender equality? The advent of AI could potentially open employment doors for women in a big way. AI, or AI-driven automation, is creating several jobs or roles that we did not think of earlier. Aside from technical skills, AI-related roles call for focused nature, communication, collaboration, adaptability, ability to learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, functional knowledge, etc. AI is data-driven and, hence, has the potential to be unbiased—but only if properly trained. Leveraging AI, employers could help develop more inclusive practices in hiring, appraising, awarding hikes, promoting and dealing with career breaks. This could help negate gender-induced interferences and discrimination. Employers could use AI to help rewrite pay-related policies or identify employees who may otherwise get passed over for promotions or those who may leave. Using AI, employers could gather data from multiple sources, viz. incidents, surveys, etc., to identify harassment possibilities, and provide for anonymous reporting, enabling more employees to report without fearing retaliation. This could help businesses build a safe online working environment with a focus on reducing workplace harassment. In doing so, organizations can create a supportive environment and prioritize mitigating the risks associated with workplace misconduct. That said, human intervention is crucial due to the risks associated with AI. However, gender bias in AI is still a very real issue and risk. Women make up only about 33% of the tech employees and only 8% of the managerial roles as per PWC, so have the representation needed to address these biases. A study by the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership analyzed 133 AI systems in multiple domains and saw that about 44% of them showed gender prejudice. There could be inherent and unintentional gender biases in systems, and since AI works with the available data, these already-existent prejudices may come into play. These prejudices, social barriers, notions, etc., are all hard to break and are difficult to get beyond. Therefore, AI ethics is paramount in this discussion. The tech industry needs to get more women in AI to counter this issue consciously. According to UN Women, "The AI field needs more women, and that requires enabling and increasing girls’ and women’s access to and leadership in STEM and ICT education and careers." To overcome these barriers, tech leaders need to eliminate these biases. We need to ensure women engineers, developers and coders are involved in the creation and training of AI systems. We need to ensure we're genuinely creating a level playing field in hiring, learning, upskilling, appraising and advancing opportunities. To turn things around and achieve greater gender equality at work, we need to prioritize inclusivity when developing these systems, and having many perspectives involved in developing and training AI models can help negate gender-oriented biases. Business leaders need to carefully monitor and advise when implementing AI in HR functions. Human oversight is key to the ethical use of the technology. Employers should ensure their HR teams develop clear and transparent goals, a mature data strategy, proper deployment (of proven tools, technologies and sources), awareness creation, and regular evaluation and course correction where necessary, etc. These guidelines should then be shared with employees at all levels to ensure the company is on the same page. Employers have the potential to create a level playing field in hiring, upskilling, appraising, etc.—to help achieve greater gender equality at work. AI could be a potential asset in a larger gender equality strategy. Those creating AI systems for employers need to develop and train these AI models to negate gender-oriented perspectives; it falls on employers to reframe policies, build a safe online environment and create a supportive environment.

Title: Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A Huge Elon Musk And Tesla Earthquake Ahead Of Critical Price ‘Tipping Point’

Bitcoin has swung wildly this last week after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk issued a surprise crypto endorsement. Unlock over $3,000 in perks including unparalleled access to a community of top Web3 entrepreneurs, creators, and investors, providing you with premium networking, priority access to global events, Free access to Forbes.com and our Forbes CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor newsletter. Apply now! The bitcoin price, up over 200% since its recent 2022 lows, has soared this year thanks to Wall Street giant BlackRock leading a bitcoin and crypto "revolution." Now, as Elon Musk warns the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy," traders are braced for his electric car company Tesla to post its third quarter earnings, potentially revealing why it suddenly moved its near-$800 million worth of bitcoin last week. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk's Tesla sent shock waves through the bitcoin and crypto market when it suddenly moved its ... [+] bitcoin last week, fueling fears Musk could either crash or boost the bitcoin price. "We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the bitcoin still owned by Tesla," blockchain sleuths with Arkham Arkham Intelligence posted to X, adding: "Tesla moved their entire balance of 11,509 bitcoin ($776.9 million) to new wallets." Tesla suddenly moving its bitcoin last week, the first time it's moved for around two years, sparked speculation that it was being moved for an over-the-counter sale. In early 2022, Musk sold off the majority of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin he had added to Tesla's balance sheet a year earlier to secure a quarterly profit for the company. Tesla will post its 2024 third-quarter results after the U.S. market closes on Wednesday, October 23, and may reveal why it moved its bitcoin. Tesla is the fourth largest corporate holder of bitcoin after bitcoin mining companies Riot and Marathon and Michael Saylor's software company MicroStrategy—which holds $17 billion worth of bitcoin. This week, Musk surprised the bitcoin and crypto market with an endorsement after recently directing his attention toward criticism of the U.S. spending, repeatedly warning the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." "I think cryptocurrency is an interesting and probably valuable bulwark against centralized control," Musk said, speaking at a campaign rally for former U.S. president Donald Trump in Pittsburgh when asked by an attendee whether the cryptocurrency XRP XRP could be incorporated into the financial system. "Crypto by its very nature helps with individual freedom," Musk said, adding he wasn't endorsing XRP or any other specific cryptocurrency. Musk later said he "wasn't actively involved in crypto," dodging a question about whether blockchains, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, could be used in future elections to reduce or eliminate voter fraud. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged back toward its all-time highs this year, with Tesla and Elon Musk ... [+] poised to trigger a major bitcoin price move. Meanwhile, bitcoin and crypto traders are closely watching the polls ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election, which could be a bitcoin price "tipping point." "Take a bird’s eye view of bitcoin, and the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been stuck in a holding pattern since March. The question on everyone’s lips is, ‘what will it take to move it?'" Richard Ptardio, cryptocurrency and financial markets analyst, said in emailed comments. "Bitcoin bulls are looking at next month’s U.S. election as the tipping point. Should Donald Trump be returned to the White House, the promise of a low-regulation administration and the likely removal of Gary Gensler as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair could break the resistance required for new all-time highs," Ptardio said. Trump has enthusiastically embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, backing his family's World Liberty Financial crypto project and selling four non-fungible token (NFT APENFT ) collections. Speaking earlier this year at a bitcoin conference, Trump promised to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if reelected and predicted the bitcoin price could eventually eclipse gold. "However, even with Trump in office, bears may be right to sound a note of caution," Ptardio said. "There are signs that bitcoin is no longer the safe haven from the type of geo-political uncertainty that tends to follow him." One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Jim Cramer on The Walt Disney Company (DIS): ‘I Say Buy More Disney’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer recently highlighted a promising start to earnings season, pondering whether the two-year-old bull market can continue its upward trajectory during an episode of Mad Money. To address this, Cramer emphasized the importance of keeping emotions in check, cautioning against complacency. He turned to analysis by Jessica Inskip, a prominent figure in the investment community who currently serves as the Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers.com. Inskip, who co-hosts the Market MakeHer podcast, has made important forecasts, including identifying the bottom in big tech growth stocks earlier this year. “... She nailed the bottom in big tech growth stocks this spring, and she's been generally bullish, constructive on the major averages all year. And those are terrific calls. Well, as Inskip sees it, things are looking pretty darn good. But even as the rally's broadening out, moving away from just the Magnificent Seven to a whole host of smaller stocks, she says, we still need tech to participate if we're going to get another leg higher. Tech doesn't have to lead the way anymore, but it has to at least follow the leaders.” Cramer then shifted the conversation to the broader market, querying the potential of stocks outside the tech giants. He pointed out the value of the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, where all 500 components carry equal importance, contrasting it with the traditional market capitalization-weighted index, which heavily favors a few large companies. Cramer noted that 2024 has been particularly favorable for the 493 other stocks within the S&P 500, as the Equal Weight index has shown impressive performance. “First, you can see this thing's been doing great because 2024 has been all about the other 493 stocks in the index. Second, Inksip sees a lot to like here. The trading cycle for the S&P 500 Equal Weight is bullish. “ Cramer mentioned that Inskip is keenly watching for higher highs in this sector. While some technicians may view a rising RSI as a warning sign, Inskip reassures that it is not a concern as long as prices continue to climb. Currently, the S&P Equal Weight index remains well above its key quarterly moving averages, according to Inskip. Cramer reiterated the importance of this Equal Weight perspective, emphasizing that the performance is not overly reliant on the Magnificent Seven, as the broader index is being supported by the remaining stocks. Turning to the Nasdaq 100, which features the hundred largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq, Cramer acknowledged that while Inskip sees it in a bullish trading cycle, it hasn’t yet reached new highs like the S&P. Nevertheless, the quarterly moving averages are still trending upward, providing support. Inskip pointed out that the Nasdaq made a higher high back in July, but for it to gain real momentum, it must surpass that peak. Once that level is breached, she believes it could trigger a broader market rally. Coming toward the conclusion, Cramer said: “Bottom line, the charts interpreted by Jessica Inskip are looking pretty darn good for the S&P and the Nasdaq 100… We've got a much broader bull market than we had six months ago. But if it's going to keep running, Inskip says we need to see some meaningful participation from tech.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired in October. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of October 18. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company. Average Price Target Upside: 15.87% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 During a previous episode of Mad Money in October, Cramer said that he is a buyer of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock. “It’s come down quite a bit. It sells at 18 times earnings. It’s down today because of I think the storms, but you know what? Disney is doing much better than people realize. And it’s about time, people started giving a little more respect. I’m a buyer of it. The analysts are dumping all over it. They’re dumping all over it now. I say buy more Disney.” Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the biggest names in the global entertainment industry, engaging in various sectors such as film and television production, streaming services, and theme park operations. On October 15, UBS maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $120. UBS expects results for the fourth quarter to show challenges in the Parks division while highlighting profitability in direct-to-consumer segments, improved box office performance, and consistent trends in linear television. The firm projects a year-over-year revenue increase of 7.2%, estimating an EBIT rise to $3.7 billion from $3 billion in the previous year, which could lead to a 33% growth in earnings per share for the quarter. For fiscal year 2024, the firm expects EPS growth exceeding 30%, aligning with management's guidance of $4.92. Furthermore, mid-single-digit EPS growth is expected for fiscal year 2025, with the potential benefits from the deconsolidation of India assets and cost efficiencies from Hulu expected to create additional opportunities as the year unfolds. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is set to introduce a new attraction entry pass called the Lightning Lane Premier Pass. It allows guests willing to pay between $129 and $449 to enjoy exclusive access to some of the park's most popular attractions. A limited number of these passes will be available starting October 23 at Disneyland in California, followed by a launch at Disney World a week later. Overall DIS ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tokenization Unstoppable: Mega Whale Holds 3 Tons of Gold Onchain

Gold, the original store of value, is inching closer to $3,000 and is currently trading above $2,700, printing fresh all-time highs in the process. As the yellow metal stretches gains, capital may flow to Bitcoin, the digital alternative, forcing the world’s most valuable coin above $74,000. While gold and Bitcoin have advantages, with the more suave favoring the fluidity of BTC, one holder seems to be interested in both. A recent analysis by Arkham, a blockchain intelligence firm, reveals that one wallet holds over $250 million in Tether Gold. In the real world, this tokenized stash weighs approximately 3 tons. For now, the owner of this tokenized stash remains unknown. However, using AI, Arkham speculates that the 3 tons of gold belong to RhinoFi. According to on-chain data, the layer-2 bridge has processed over $2.3 billion worth of assets from more than 48.8 million transactions. It currently bridges 31 chains, connecting over 2 million accounts. Tether Gold is technically a stablecoin tracking the real-world value of gold. As of October 22, over 246,520 tokens of digital gold had been minted on Ethereum. According to Ethplorer, there are 2,618 token holders making more than 39,500 transfers. Although it cannot be immediately determined that RhinoFi controls nearly 50% of all Tether Gold in circulation, tokenization is picking up traction. The success of USD-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC and their widespread adoption, especially in emerging economies, explain why they are here to stay. Converting real-world assets into tokens on public ledgers like Ethereum or Polygon makes it easier for users to transfer and gain exposure. The CEO of BlackRock predicts the tokenization market will command trillions in the next few years. Coingecko data shows over $7.9 billion of assets have been tokenized. Most of them are on Ondo, Pendle, and Mantra. Beyond Tether Gold, other tokenized alternatives include Pax Gold and Quorium. In addition to gold, real estate and United States Treasuries have been tokenized. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, currently issues BUIDL on Ethereum. Looking at rwa.xyz data, over $2.4 billion worth of United States treasuries, bonds, and other cash equivalents have been tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL currently manages over $550 million of tokenized treasuries. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ambani’s Jio in Talks With Allianz for Insurance JVs in India

Jio Financial Services Ltd., controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has held talks with Allianz SE to set up an insurance partnership in India as the German firm seeks to scrap two existing joint ventures in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Allianz and Jio Financial are looking to establish a general insurance and a life insurance company in the South Asian nation, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The discussions are in early stages and both parties may decide not to proceed with the plan, the people said. The Munich-based firm has indicated to its current partner Bajaj Finserv Ltd. that it’s “actively considering an exit” from the ventures, according to a statement from Bajaj on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported the planned split. Allianz “has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market,” according to the statement. The break-up centers around a dispute over the direction of the partnership, people familiar with the matter had said. A spokesperson for Jio Financial said the firm is unable to comment on speculation. “If and when there are any material developments with respect to the company, we will continue to make necessary disclosures in accordance with our obligations, as we always have,” the spokesperson added. Allianz doesn’t comment on market rumors, a Munich-based spokesperson said. Jio Financial, helmed by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, already runs a shadow bank and an insurance brokerage and has joined forces with BlackRock Inc. to start an asset management business. Setting up insurance operations will help further the Ambani unit’s ambition of becoming a financial services behemoth. India’s insurance penetration rate — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is less than half that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, implying strong growth prospects for the sector, insurance regulator data show.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military.

A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The AI-powered tools are designed to automate tasks for engineers, technicians, warehouse workers, and more. Customers of Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) across the industrial sector will be able to achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved operational productivity, and upskill employees. The first solutions will be available to Honeywell customers from 2025. "The path to autonomy requires assets working harder, people working smarter and processes working more efficiently”. Overall HON ranks 8th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military.

The agreement aims to optimize restaurant operations through robotics and AI cloud technology, with each location expected to generate between $700,000 and $2 million in annual revenue.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns.

A Nuclear power plant with all its safety & security protocols in place. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is a nuclear technology company engaged in the design and development of fission power plants to provide reliable and commercial-scale energy to customers in the United States. AI has been driving significant energy demand, and nuclear energy has emerged as a strong avenue to address the increase in power demand. Last week, Amazon Web Services announced plans that it will invest $500 million in nuclear power. Big tech companies are increasingly facing energy demands driven by the AI revolution, and many of them have already entered into agreements to meet their energy needs. Following the announcement, nuclear names such as Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) continued to rise on Monday on the back of optimism in the sector. There is also increased speculation that Sam Altman’s backed Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) will be the next one to secure a deal with a major tech player. In a CNBC interview last week, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte stated the massive demand for power is being driven by AI growth. When asked about the potential for the company to announce a deal similar to Google’s deal with Kairos Power, he stated that there is “a lot more to come”. Oklo shares closed on Monday with a 22.4% increase, reaching $22.32. Overall OKLO ranks 14th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OKLO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Mukesh Ambani warming up to Allianz for insurance amid Bajaj exit plans? Here's what we know
URL: https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/mukesh-ambani-warming-up-to-allianz-for-insurance-amid-bajaj-exit-plans-heres-what-we-know-451155-2024-10-23
Time Published: 2024-10-23T05:54:52Z
Full Content:
Feedback Jio Financial Services Ltd., led by Mukesh Ambani, is reportedly in talks with German insurance giant Allianz SE to explore a potential insurance partnership in India. Discussions are focused on establishing both general and life insurance companies in India, claimed a Bloomberg report. These talks are in early stages, and it is still unclear if the companies will proceed with the plan. Allianz is reportedly looking to exit its two existing joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd., marking the end of a partnership that has lasted more than two decades. Bajaj Finserv confirmed that Allianz is “actively considering an exit” from its life and general insurance ventures, citing a shift in Allianz's strategic priorities. This was confirmed following a report by Bloomberg. The break-up between Allianz and Bajaj Finserv stems from a dispute over the direction of the partnership, with sources indicating that Bajaj’s refusal to allow Allianz to raise its stake at a discounted price contributed to the rift. Additionally, Allianz reportedly was not given a say in key strategic decisions. A spokesperson for Jio Financial Services declined to comment on the ongoing speculation, stating, "If and when there are any material developments, we will continue to make necessary disclosures." A spokesperson for Allianz, based in Munich, also stated that the company does not comment on market rumors, Bloomberg stated in the report. Jio Financial, which is currently led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, has already ventured into financial services through a shadow banking operation and insurance brokerage. The firm has also teamed up with BlackRock Inc. to enter the asset management business. The addition of insurance to its portfolio would further Jio Financial’s ambitions of becoming a major player in India’s financial sector. India’s insurance penetration rate is significantly lower than that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, highlighting the sector’s potential for growth. According to data from the insurance regulator, this presents a considerable opportunity for companies like Jio Financial and Allianz. Business Today could not independently verify the details of the ongoing talks. The story will be updated following comments from Jio Financial and Allianz. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Title: WoW turns 20 (and we turn 20 years older) this year, with a huge anniversary event — here’s everything you need to know about the big birthday bash

NEXT | A checklist of achievement rewards and vendor loot to acquire durin... This year isn’t just another anniversary: with World of Warcraft turning 20, the game is getting a massive anniversary event that will let us relive old glories, collect plenty of loot, and even show off our favorite transmogs. The event is so large that it will take up an entire (minor) patch cycle, with all of patch 11.0.5 dedicated to the anniversary. The patch launches on October 22, and we’ll be able to participate in the anniversary celebration through November and December. But let’s get to the details! Here’s everything that’s happening for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday: If you prefer, you can consume the above information in video form, though if you do I have to assume that it has not in fact been 20 years for you. Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart. This is a woman who has been in a six-hour Blackrock Depths run with countless deaths that fell apart before making it to the last boss. I feel you here, Holly, though I am hopeful my current guild can handle the new raid’s 13 bosses without falling apart. While this event comprises the majority of patch 11.0.5, there are a couple of new things in the patch that aren’t directly related to the anniversary:More goodies for Dracthyr! The formerly Evoker-only race will get new classes (Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, and Warlock) and a special Skyriding talent that will let them soar in a squadron of their fellow Dracthyr.An update to Shamans’ Ascendance form, with variants themed after different elements.I think it’s a fun patch, with plenty to keep us occupied until whatever Blizzard has planned for 11.0.7.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘If You’re Looking For Pure-Play, Go With Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT)’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-looking-pure-232237315.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T23:22:37Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a group of technicians working on complex data center systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Cramer recently called Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) a “pure-play’ and said: “Data centers remain one of the hottest themes in the market, and if you're looking for pure-play, go with Vertiv, which makes electrical equipment for these warehouses full of servers. Now that said, this stock is so red hot that it might not be able to rally on earnings unless it raises its forecast to unfathomable levels. Then again, Vertiv’s business is so strong, it's so strong that unfathomable might be fathomable.” Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) is engaged in creating and maintaining essential digital infrastructure technologies and lifecycle services tailored for data centers, communication networks, and a range of commercial and industrial applications. After reporting a strong performance in the first half of the year, it gave an upward adjustment to its full-year sales guidance by $50 million, with $75 million of this growth attributed to organic development. Alongside this, the company raised its full-year adjusted operating profit forecast by $85 million, now aiming for $1.435 billion. The increase is linked to a rise in sales volume and improved variable contribution margins anticipated in the latter half of the year, driven by improved productivity in both procurement and manufacturing processes. Additionally, the company also adjusted its full-year guidance for operating margins, now projecting an adjusted operating margin of 18.7% at the midpoint. It is an increase of 100 basis points from previous estimates and 200 basis points above initial forecasts made during the November investor conference. Furthermore, the company's forecasted adjusted diluted EPS for 2024 is set at $2.50 at the midpoint, representing over 40% growth compared to 2023, largely due to an increase in adjusted operating profit. Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) has been making significant strides in liquid cooling technology, positioning itself as an alternative to conventional energy management practices in data centers. In September, the company announced a significant expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in North America with the opening of a new facility in Pelzer, South Carolina. The site will add 215,000 square feet of production space and is expected to create up to 300 skilled jobs in the region. The Pelzer facility will focus on the production of various infrastructure solutions, including integrated modular systems and modular power solutions, capitalizing on the company’s extensive portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure technologies designed for data centers.

Join the 20th Anniversary Celebration near the Caverns of Time, spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock, ascend with a new Shaman Ascendance form, and more. Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Take part in a new Timewalking event that will take you through the original version of Deadmines, Zul’Farrak, Dire Maul (east and west wings), and Stratholme’s living and undead dungeons for epic new rewards. Queue up via the Adventure Journal or the Group Finder with players level 10 and above. Players will have the option to visit special vendors to get new mounts, pets, and transmog appearances. Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory. This year’s celebration event has expanded, and the bronze dragonflight have taken the activities just outside the Caverns of Time with various new and exciting things to do. Show off your transmog at the Fashion Frenzy stage hosted by Althaea. Mount up to match Abigail Cyrildotr at the Mount Mania arena and show off your mount collection. Join Lorewalker Cho at the Storyteller stage for an epic tale you can’t help but join in on. Take a photo with guildmates, venture to epic vistas, disguise yourself as your pet, cosplay as famous heroes or villains, skate on the rink, or take a balloon for a lazy ride around the event space. There’s plenty to see and do as you join the celebration in Tanaris, and it’s available to players at level 15 and above. There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade. Assist Alyx each week with resolving new guest mysteries by using your new secret-finding skills, and be on the lookout for stolen celebration goods. Follow the rumors and solve the mystery— if you can. We’re counting on you, secret finders. Players can begin working on the initial secrets beginning on October 28 with additional secrets opening up on November 4. Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley. Players who complete the quest, “Korrak’s Revenge,” will be rewarded one of two mounts based on your character’s faction: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde). Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature. With the addition of new classes to Dracthyr, we are making some further adjustments to their racials. Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies. But wait, there’s more! Shaman can also look forward to new Ascendance forms to express their elemental mastery. Restoration Shaman will get a new Water form, Elemental will get a new Fire form, and Enhancement will get a new Wind form. Learn more about all the additional changes and updates in the 20th Anniversary Celebration Content Update in our notes. 1920x1080, 3840x2160, 1080x1920 We look forward to celebrating all things World of Warcraft with you. We’ll see you in Azeroth!

Among those highlighted in a Monday speech by SEC Chair Gary Gensler was the need to modernize equity markets, in part by embracing shorter settlement times. A retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers caused GameStop’s stock price to spike nearly four years ago amid the “meme stock” craze. Forced to hold or sell shares skyrocketing in price, restrictions imposed by several brokerage firms blunted the rally that was later enshrined in stock market history and recounted in books and films. Gensler, an unwavering critic of the digital assets industry, partly pinned the restrictions on a lack of market efficiency. Ultimately, a shift toward shorter settlement times—that experts say blockchains benefit from—improved upon mechanics that stifled some GameStop investors. “Many everyday investors lost access to the market at a critical time,” Gensler said. “The longer it takes for a trade to settle—the slower the plumbing—the more risk our markets assume.” When purchasing or selling a stock on a venue like the New York Stock Exchange, there is a delay between when the transaction is made and when it becomes fully processed across a series of intermediaries, including a broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. Notably, the SEC has accused crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase of fulfilling several of these roles at once, without proper registration, while facilitating securities transactions. Both companies have denied the regulator’s claims amid ongoing battles in federal courts. Once conducted through paper checks and physical certificates, the settlement window for securities has been shortened with SEC rule changes over time. Commonly referred to as T+2, a two-day settlement window was reduced in May, making what Gensler said was “a real difference” for everyday investors. At the same time, the shift to T+1 influenced the relationship between brokers, which match buyers and sellers, and clearinghouses that facilitate the exchange of securities and payments. Margin calls from clearinghouses led some brokers to restrict purchases of GameStop stock during its famed short squeeze in 2021. But the “amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse” was reduced significantly with T+1’s adoption, Gensler said. Gensler’s GameStop reflection followed crypto-focused remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller last week. Discussing the merits of decentralized finance (DeFi), he described how intermediaries have historically provided value—but now face competition. As reflected in the popularity of centralized crypto exchanges, Waller posited that DeFi could play a complementary role to existing financial markets, rather than replace legacy systems. Along those lines, he said distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain could be an “efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping,” while smart contracts flatten trade structures. “Smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act,” Waller said. “This can provide value, as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement.” Companies like tZERO are building blockchain-based marketplaces for private securities. The Utah-based firm gained approval from the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to operate as a custodian for digital assets sold as securities last month. In early 2025, the firm plans to launch with a “full digitization” of its Series-A preferred equity. But Wall Street tastemakers have visions for a crypto-based market extending far beyond that. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed tokenization as the “next generation for securities” in 2022. Using a digital representation of an asset to conduct trades on a blockchain, he said the process would provide market participants with “instantaneous settlement” and “reduced fees.” Alongside the crypto’s rise, financial firms have looked at other qualities inherent to blockchains, such as the 24/7 schedule that they operate under within the context of trading. Crypto markets don’t close, which can provide both opportunities and risks alike. In April, the Financial Times reported that the New York Stock Exchange was exploring round-the-clock trading. The development would be a significant break from the exchange’s regular six-and-a-half hour trading window, extended as recently as 1985.

Title: Jim Cramer on Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN): ‘I Like It Ahead Of The Quarter, Even Though It Has A Little More Cyclicality Than Most Chip Makers’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm in the process of assembling a complex circuit board - showing the industrial scale the company operates at. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 While Cramer mentioned that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has shown cyclicality, he still likes it ahead of the company reporting its third-quarter earnings on October 22. “After the close, we hear from Texas Instruments. We've been hearing a lot about how semiconductor companies are in the doldrums, the ones without AI, that is. Tex Instruments falls into that category but this company's become much more focused. I like it ahead of the quarter, even though it has a little more cyclicality than most chip makers.” Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is engaged in the design and sale of semiconductors. The company provides a range of products focused on power management, signal processing, and embedded computing, which are utilized across various sectors, including automotive, industrial, personal electronics, and communications. On October 21, TipRanks reported that Susquehanna lowered the price target on the stock to $240 from $250 and maintained a Positive rating. In previewing the upcoming third-quarter results, the firm noted that the semiconductor industry is facing broad-based challenges, particularly in the automotive and industrial segments, where momentum has started to decline. For the personal computer market, there is an expectation for notebook production to rise in 2024, although the pace may slow toward the year’s end, largely due to AI-related devices not driving demand as anticipated. In the handset market, forecasts indicate an increase in smartphone shipments for 2024. Additionally, in the data center segment, recent server evaluations suggest a slightly stronger performance in the latter half of 2024, partly driven by AMD's market share gains. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) management has indicated an awareness that market conditions may not be as favorable as previously thought. In its midyear update to its long-term planning, which is typically conducted once a year, the company maintained its spending plans for 2024 and 2025. However, it revised the outlook for 2026 expenditures, lowering the anticipated range from $5 billion to between $2 billion and $5 billion, contingent on revenue performance at that time. Overall TXN ranks 13th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Reuters) - (This Oct. 18 story has been corrected to say that the NYSE received approval to trade options on 3, not 11 ETFs, in the headline and paragraph 1, to remove references to IBIT and Invesco Galaxy approvals in paragraph 4, and to add a line about CBOE approvals in paragraph 3) The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Separately, Cboe Global also got approval to trade options on two spot bitcoin ETFs, according to a filing. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

Title: Jim Cramer on United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS): ‘Could This Be The Quarter That Gets UPS Out Of Its Funk?’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect.

A warehouse filled with boxes of parcels, symbolizing the companies reliable logistics services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44 Cramer recently discussed United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) as the company passed his YEV stocks criteria. We explained what the YEV criteria are and more in our article, Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List of 9 YEV Stocks. Here's what Cramer said on October 18: “Could this be the quarter that gets UPS out of its funk? It's possible. And that almost 5% yield might cushion the blow if something goes wrong.” United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is a prominent package delivery and logistics company, known for its extensive range of services, which include transportation, distribution, contract logistics, and various freight solutions. In September, it announced the acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, both recognized leaders in healthcare logistics based in Germany. While the financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, these companies bring significant expertise in managing complex healthcare logistics, including a network of temperature-controlled warehousing spanning six temperature zones and a comprehensive cold chain transportation solution across Europe. The acquisition is expected to improve the company's capabilities in meeting the growing demands of healthcare customers who require efficient handling of temperature-sensitive and time-critical shipments. Kate Gutmann, UPS’s Executive Vice President and President of International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, noted that the rapid advancements in the pharmaceutical industry are driving the need for integrated cold and frozen supply chains. She emphasized that Frigo-Trans will expand the company's solution offerings and support the company’s ambition to become the leading provider of complex healthcare logistics globally. On October 10, Wells Fargo raised the price target on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) to $142 from $134 and kept an Overweight rating. Ahead of the third-quarter earnings report, the firm made slight adjustments to its estimates for the fourth quarter but kept its outlook for the third quarter positive. The firm observed favorable trends for the company in the third quarter, with signs of volume growth and pricing actions suggesting a pathway to achieving the company's full-year guidance. Overall UPS ranks 17th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of UPS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: BlackRock taps into AI frenzy with two new ETFs

(Reuters) - Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Tuesday launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aimed at giving investors exposure to the booming market for artificial intelligence. Generative AI, designed to create human-like interactions by processing vast amounts of data, has taken the world by storm and is expected to be integrated into virtually all industries in the coming years from technology to financial services. "As an investing theme, BlackRock views AI as a mega force with broad investing implications both now and in the long term," the world's largest asset manager said. Asset managers have been rolling out thematic ETFs to capitalize on the popularity of certain themes, sectors or trends, unlike traditional products that track broad market indexes. Demand for these products, however, has been mixed in recent months as investors have been opting for funds linked to stock market benchmarks, which are hovering near record highs. BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF will invest in global AI and technology stocks across market capitalizations. Its iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF shares a similar investment objective, aiming for long-term capital appreciation by investing in global technology companies across sectors like semiconductors, software and hardware, among others. "These active ETFs can help investors seize outsized and overlooked investment opportunities across the full stack of AI and advanced technologies," said Tony Kim, BlackRock's head of the fundamental equities technology group. Earlier this month, the asset manager beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and its assets under management (AUM) hit a record high as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows. As of Sept 30, its iShares business - with over 1400 ETFs - had $4.2 trillion in AUM.

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet is this week’s World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | How much World of Warcraft content is too much at one time? The War Within Season 1 continues and we’ve made our second full circuit of all the World Bosses with the return this week of Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time. Orta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin. The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters: As always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.

Title: Larry Fink: Supercharge Economy Through Infrastructure, AI Investing

Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:35:23Z

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s annual meeting on Monday, stressed the need for policy makers to address the federal deficit and $36 trillion national debt, pointing to the strength of U.S. capital markets as a way to improve the country’s fiscal woes. “The economy is growing about 3%, but if you take out the excess spending of the federal government [$1.8 trillion deficit], that’s an equivalent of 6% GDP,” Fink said. “The growth is on the back of debt; the growth is not on the back of equity … we are going to have a [debt] crisis.” One way to tackle the deficit, the CEO of the $11.5 trillion asset manager said, is to grow the economy above the trendline by investing in major projects like infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Fink pointed out the billions that AI and data center projects cost, noting that these investments are opportunities for private capital to grow the economy. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  “I’m not frightened of this deficit, but it’s pretty cautionary if we don’t find a way to unlock growth,” Fink said. “This is my message to every politician: We need to be unlocking growth from the private sector, and the U.S. is in the best position of any country in the world because of the scale of our capital markets.” Fink says the way to unlock capitalism and achieve this growth is not to raise or lower taxes, but to make the capital markets more efficient, so that they can provide more funding for more segments of the economy. Permitting reform is needed to clear a major hindrance to building needed infrastructure projects, Fink noted in his remarks: “The permitting process is inhibiting growth, inhibiting opportunity.” Fink also pointed to the role that private credit can play in infrastructure investing. “I think the biggest growth of private credit can be infrastructure credit,” Fink said. “I believe you’re going to see more and more opportunities in all the different shades of credit.” Related Stories: Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter BlackRock’s Purchase of GIP Deepens Its Alts Exposure Gap Narrowing Between Infrastructure Investments and Allocation Targets Tags: AI, BlackRock, data centers, Infrastructure, Larry Fink, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, SIFMA « Rest Super Names Interim Co-CIOs

Title: Michael Saylor’s Latest Remarks Shock The Bitcoin World: What He Said
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-latest-remark-shock-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:30:36Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with journalist Madison Reidy, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, stirred a massive controversy within the Bitcoin community with his remarks on custody and regulation. The discussion centered around the risks associated with large institutions holding significant amounts of BTC and the potential for government seizure or confiscation, reminiscent of historical events like the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 in 1933. When questioned about the risks of having a significant amount of BTC held by third-party custodians and large institutions, Saylor dismissed concerns of increased seizure or confiscation. He argued that BTC is safer in the hands of regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JP Morgan than with unregulated private holders. Saylor suggested that when Bitcoin is held by “crypto anarchists” who operate outside of government regulations and tax systems, it poses a greater risk of government intervention. “I think it’s the opposite. I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” He emphasized that regulated institutions provide stability and trustworthiness. “When you have regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, and State Street Bank holding the asset, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms are invested in those entities. There’s no way that all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets from Fidelity and BlackRock or Vanguard because that’s where all their retirement money is invested.” Reidy brought up the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 during the Great Depression as a historical precedent for potential government seizure. Saylor dismissed this comparison, labeling it a “myth and a trope” propagated by paranoid “crypto anarchists.” He contended that the circumstances are fundamentally different because, at that time, the US was on the gold standard, and the government needed to control gold to devalue the dollar. “Today, we’re not on the gold standard or the Bitcoin standard,” Saylor stated. He argued that the US government has no incentive to seize BTC held in custody any more than it would seize stocks or real estate. “I don’t think we have to worry about Bitcoin held in custody being seized by the government any more than you have to worry about your Apple stock being seized by the government,” Saylor claimed. Saylor’s remarks did not sit well with many in the Bitcoin community, who value decentralization and self-custody as core principles. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, responded on X: “Calling self-custody ‘crypto-anarchism’ oversimplifies what Bitcoin accomplishes. It’s about freedom—freedom of speech, property rights, and protecting your right to own what’s yours. We must not dismiss it because freedom isn’t promised—it must be fought for and protected.” He acknowledged his respect for Saylor but emphasized the importance of diverse views in a free market. “My goal is simply to defend the principles that I believe make Bitcoin powerful: freedom and the ability for anyone to engage with it however they see fit,” Mallers added. Sina Nader, co-founder of 21st Capital, criticized Saylor’s position: “Terrible look for Saylor to become a shill for the government and banking system and call true Bitcoiners paranoid. Saylor is on a mission to relegate Bitcoin into an investment pet rock and halt its usage as a currency.” Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, warned: “A government doesn’t need to physically confiscate your Bitcoin. It can just lock custodial BTC into approved custodians forever, aka ‘Institutional Bitcoin.’ While a government that isn’t on a Bitcoin Standard technically shouldn’t have incentive to confiscate BTC, it actually does still have an incentive to degrade and attack Bitcoin.” Mow suggested that governments might seek to undermine Bitcoin because it represents a “harder and superior money” that could diminish the value of fiat currencies. He urged the community to “plan accordingly” with a self-custody solution and “expect [a] 6102,” referencing the historical executive order. At press time, BTC traded at $67,707.

The researchers said in their article released last month in the journal Science Advances they had “calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas,” making up “35 to 136% of the current US lithium resource estimate.” According to a Monday release from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), “the Smackover Formation is a relic of an ancient sea that left an extensive, porous, and permeable limestone geologic unit that extends under parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.” Lithium, which has been labeled by the USGS as a critical mineral, has been often obtained from brines or salt flats they evaporate into. According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

Out of sight, out of mind. IMHO, most of them are scared to be the one to break the narrative. As an EV owner and solar owner (not because of warmageddon fears, but because I'm trying to be more self-reliant and I can produce my own power a lot easier than I can produce my own gasoline), I sometimes meet other EV owners if I take the EV on a trip and charge away from home. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone thanked me for saving the world or such. I usually show them the graph below and tell them that we'd all freak out if we knew what went into making EV's. Sometimes they say, "but who could I tell that would believe me". Fun topic: If I'm in the south when this conversation happens, which means in the Bible Belt, I point out that the Minoan Warm Period mirrors the Era of Judges, Greek Dark Age cooling period mirrors the Era of Kings, and the Christ and the Apostles lived during the Roman Warm Period. Because they are fellow Bible believers, those are the few EV owners who I've been able to educate that the Modern Warm Period is not the freakazoid unique thing that leftists make it out to be. Most of them still fear warmageddon. But a few of them said I made them rethink their cult religion to come back to believing more in God and the Bible. 18 posted on 10/22/2024 7:00:06 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release. 19 million tons? That should last a year. Maybe two. Leftists will ban mining for lithium there, while they also demand we transition to depending solely on EV’s and “green” power for the grid (all of which would rely on batteries). You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt............... Welp, you can guess where the next hurricane and land grab will occur. nothing say i love the environment like digging it up and trashing the scene. > Leftists will ban mining for lithium there… < You beat me to it. Some advocacy group will find a rare snail living there. Or maybe a study will show that the mining will contribute to Climate Change. Then they will all get in their EV’s and drive off to a Starbucks to celebrate their victory. The question is, can they steer a hurricane that far inland so that companies like Blackrock can buy up the land for pennies on the dollar? /sarc Tennessee Ernie Ford 1955 “Some advocacy group will find a rare snail living there. Or maybe a study will show that the mining will contribute to Climate Change.” Lithium mining as well as cobalt mining are terrible for the environment and for the miners I’m watching for tge secrecy and hypocrisy From WIKI: Mineral resources The Smackover Formation has been a prolific source of petroleum. The 1922 discovery of the Smackover oil field, after which the Smackover Formation is named, resulted in a sizeable oil boom in southern Arkansas. In addition to being a petroleum reservoir, as of 2015, the brine from the Smackover Formation is the only source of commercial bromine in the United States. A 2022 report estimated that the lithium brine in the formation has “sufficient lithium to produce enough batteries for 50 million electric vehicles.” In October 2024, federal and state researchers said there might be five million to 19 million tons of lithium, more than enough to meet the world’s demand for the battery ingredient. Billy Boy and Evita will jump on that like a duck on a June bug Look out Arkansas, an unnatural disaster could be in the making for you. Wherever lithium lies it seems unnatural disasters seem to just happen. 🤔😕 There are Lepidolite mines (lithium extracted from this) in New Mexico which were abandoned when the main use was pharmaceutical. They covered the walls in these caves (I have examined personally), and now there should be a demand for the mines to be re-opened. Time to bulldoze southern red states using an excuse. > Lithium mining as well as cobalt mining are terrible for the environment and for the miners < Yes indeed. But “progressives” don’t really care about that. They only care that it is not done in their backyard. Out of sight, out of mind. We see the same thing with the illegals. Let’s welcome our new Americans! But when a group of illegals showed up on Martha’s Vineyard, they were all removed from the island pretty damn quick. IMHO, most of them are scared to be the one to break the narrative. As an EV owner and solar owner (not because of warmageddon fears, but because I'm trying to be more self-reliant and I can produce my own power a lot easier than I can produce my own gasoline), I sometimes meet other EV owners if I take the EV on a trip and charge away from home. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone thanked me for saving the world or such. I usually show them the graph below and tell them that we'd all freak out if we knew what went into making EV's. Sometimes they say, "but who could I tell that would believe me". Fun topic: If I'm in the south when this conversation happens, which means in the Bible Belt, I point out that the Minoan Warm Period mirrors the Era of Judges, Greek Dark Age cooling period mirrors the Era of Kings, and the Christ and the Apostles lived during the Roman Warm Period. Because they are fellow Bible believers, those are the few EV owners who I've been able to educate that the Modern Warm Period is not the freakazoid unique thing that leftists make it out to be. Most of them still fear warmageddon. But a few of them said I made them rethink their cult religion to come back to believing more in God and the Bible.

Title: AI datacentres take the nuclear option

Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:11:57Z
Full Content:
Oct 22, 2024 A model of a small modular reactor designed by X-energy. Source: Amazon. The power and utility of AI, be it unimodal or multimodal, is ultimately limited by the volume, and quality, of the data that is scraped, stored and manipulated to provide relevant and useful outputs to end users. The immense quantity of data required for AI systems to operate increases with every minute of every day, seemingly ad infinitum, and that in turn is putting increasing pressure on the resources required to support that data processing. Nuclear power, it seems, is one of the ways to relieve some of that pressure. The data underpinning generative AI (GenAI) has to be stored and processed somewhere, and that means construction of bigger datacentres around the world, all of which have to access power sufficient to keep them cool (literally!), calm and collected. Datacentres are very expensive to build, operate and manage, and it is increasingly obvious that the current model supporting GenAI is becoming unsustainable and will have to be replaced: That will come at gigantic cost and huge disruption but there will be no option in the medium to long term. The data warehouses that enable the likes of ChatGPT are on the verge of exceeding their feasible size limits, Mark Russinovich, CTO at Microsoft Azure, told the Semafor news website recently, and he’s not alone. What is needed with some urgency, according to Russinovich, is a new model and method of connecting multiple datacentres so that they can handle the practically inordinate processing load that will characterise future generations of the GenAI we now take for granted and the emergence of the still-undefined and theoretical artificial general intelligence (AGI) of the future that may be capable of exceeding the intellectual capabilities of humanity – see Is multimodal AI a dead-end on the road to AGI? AGI is a long way away, and may never be realised, and as things stand today with the model we have and seem to be stuck with, even the most advanced AI is centred on large language models (LLMs) that are trained in datacentre facilities running hundreds of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) that can be chained to run as a single gigantic computer. Datacentre annual global energy consumption to double in the next five years All of this requires astonishing levels of power. Research firm IDC expects global datacentre electricity consumption to more than double between 2023 and 2028, notching up a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% over the five-year period to reach 857 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2028. (1TWh is 1 billion kilowatt hours, roughly the equivalent of power sufficient to fully light 1 million average homes 24 hours a day for a full year.) The amount of power required to perform massive AI operations is already putting immense strain on the ageing and often neglected national grid in the US, which is home to most of the world’s hyperscale datacentres. The available megawattage devoted to datacentre operations is at its peak and that is causing all manner of problems for the utility firms and the datacentre sector. According to the analyst house RystadEnergy, headquartered in Oslo, Norway, since 2010 total US electricity demand has been relatively stable at some 4,000 TWh but it is changing as the proliferation of giant datacentres and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) drive demand for the extra generation of electricity. RystadEnergy’s research shows that the two sectors will add 290 TWh of new power demand by 2030. RystadEnergy adds that electricity demand for datacentres and the chip foundries that provide them with GPU microprocessors will increase cumulative demand by 177 TWh between 2023 to 2030, reaching a total of 307 TWh from the 130TWh required in 2023. Meanwhile, global management consultancy, Bain and Company, has published a report showing that “surging datacentre power consumption could require more than $2tn in new energy generation resources worldwide. Furthermore, US energy demand could outstrip supply within the next few years; meeting demand would require utilities to boost annual generation by up to 26% by 2028.” That would be a huge task. The report adds: “Facing potentially overwhelming demand from datacentres, US utilities are grappling with a challenge few executives anticipated: After years of navigating flat or shrinking demand, many organisations have forgotten what it takes to grow. What’s more, they’re finding that capitalising on this new opportunity will require a rapid, unprecedented transformation of their operating and business models.” It continues: “For nearly two decades, efficiency and operational nimbleness were paramount while US electricity demand plateaued as a result of advances in energy efficiency and distributed generation offsetting economic growth. But the era of stagnant demand is over. The late 2022 breakthrough in generative AI and the ensuing datacentre boom blindsided utilities just as demand was also rising because of repatriated manufacturing, industrial policy, and vehicle electrification. “Now, US utilities are bracing for demand to outstrip supply during the next few years, with datacentres accounting for the bulk of the increase. Supply, both in generation and transmission, will take years to catch up… by 2028, utilities would need to increase annual energy generation by between 7% and 26% above the 2023 total to meet projected demand. That’s far beyond the largest five-year generation boost of about 5% that US utilities achieved from 2005 through 2023.” The report also finds that datacentre annual global energy consumption could “double by 2027 from 2023 levels, growing at a compound annual rate of 10% to 24% and potentially surpassing 1 million gigawatt hours in 2027 [even greater than IDC’s projection]. Serving a 1-gigawatt datacentre requires the capacity of about four natural gas plants or around half of a large nuclear plant.” The Biden administration, well aware of the looming crisis in the US grid, passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which set aside $3bn for AI infrastructure such as new power cables, but that sum is a drop in the ocean of the investment required. To put things into perspective, in partnership with the US-headquartered BlackRock, Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, with $10tn to call on, Microsoft has launched its own $30bn AI infrastructure fund. The company has also been negotiating the re-opening of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant – yes, the one that went into partial ‘China Syndrome’ meltdown back in March 1979 – and simultaneously is working to form partnerships to foster green energy initiatives. The problem is urgent and daunting. Google says its first small modular reactor (SMR) will be in place and working by 2030 In his interview with Semafor, Microsoft Azure’s Russinovich said one answer to the problem might be constructing datacentres in multiple locations so as to spread the load across the power grids of different cities or regions. In a masterpiece of understatement he said, “It would be technically challenging, but it may be necessary. I think it’s inevitable, especially when you get to the kind of scale that these things are getting to.” However, connecting datacentre networks across long distances is fraught with problems, not least because maintaining the speed of AI data transfer across painstakingly synchronised fibre optic cable would be of paramount importance. The greater the distance, the higher the possibility that faults and mistimings would arise. Certainly, datacentres are trying to reduce their energy consumption. For example, many are migrating from pumped air systems to liquid-cooling processes but even liquid cooling draws a huge amount of power from the grid and is financially inefficient beyond a certain size. The only solution in the short to medium term appears to be nuclear power, and in the absence of any breakthrough in the quest for nuclear fusion, nuclear fission it will be, along with its attendant problems and dangers. In a recent blog, Google announced it had reached “the world’s first corporate agreement” to “purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to be developed by Kairos Power” of California. Water is used as a coolant in conventional nuclear reactors, but Kairos Power reactors use molten fluoride salts instead. The salts have exceptional chemical stability and a great capacity for transferring heat at high temperature and the ability to retain fission products. Many studies have shown that molten fluoride salts are compatible with conventional high-temperature structural materials, such as stainless steel, and are ideal in terms of reliability and a long-operational life in a commercial environment. The initial phase will see the first Kairos Power’s SMRs in situ and operational by 2030. Thereafter, additional reactors will be deployed at intervals until 2035. Google says the deal “will enable up to 500 MW of new 24/7 carbon-free power to US electricity grids and help more communities benefit from clean and affordable nuclear power.” Google’s announcement was quickly followed by news from Amazon that it has “signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects – including enabling the construction of several new small modular reactors.” In Washington state it has struck an agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, for the development of four advanced SMRs, while Amazon is also making an investment in X-energy, a developer of next-generation SMR reactors and fuel: X-energy’s advanced nuclear reactor design will be used in the Energy Northwest project. In addition, Amazon has signed an agreement with utility company Dominion Energy in Virginia, where many large datacentres are located, to “explore the development of an SMR project near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. This will bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region, where Dominion projects that power demands will increase by 85% over the next 15 years,” noted Amazon. Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: “Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040. One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon free and able to scale – which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon. Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.” It’s not an instant solution to a very pressing problem, but it is a start. – Martyn Warwick, Editor in Chief, TelecomTV Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Mineral rights royalties are a form of passive income generated by companies that extract resources such as oil or gas from fund-owned properties. Energy market analytics company RBN Energy estimates that mineral and royalty interests amount to $700 billion. Qualified retail and institutional investors can browse tokenized mineral rights-based funds, invest in them and review their portfolio’s performance directly on the platform, Elmnts said Tuesday in a statement. The company said funds on Elmnts will offer double-digit yields, with minimum investments set at $1,000. The platform has launched with one fund, with plans to add more soon. “Our vision is to bring liquidity and accessibility to high-yielding assets that are otherwise hard to access,” Elmnts Chief Product Officer James Pacheco told Decrypt. “Mineral rights are a perfect example—they generate predictable, long-term income through oil and gas royalties, but very few people even know they exist, much less how to participate.” The Solana project will be available “virtually everywhere,” access to certain funds could differ based on the client's country of residence, Pacheco said. Tokenized investment funds’ popularity has skyrocketed in recent months, inspiring the creation of new funds based on all kinds of tokenized tangible assets. BlackRock last spring launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund based on tokenized US Treasury Bills — the largest tokenized investment fund as of publication time with more than $550 million assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Guggenheim Treasury Securities partnered with blockchain technology firm Zeconomy in September to launch a fund based on digital commercial paper, while Midas earlier this month launched two tokenized investment products based on mTBill and mBasis, respectively.

NEXT | What could be coming in The War Within patch 11.1? World of Warcraft‘s 20th anniversary event is nearly here, and if that made you feel ancient, it’s probably time for an annual checkup; also, go drink some water. We’re getting tons of content for the anniversary event — blast levels on alts with the 20% buff, revisit the Blackrock Depths with Moira Thaurissan, blast through classic dungeons, earn some truly fantastic rewards (including a beautiful blue phoenix), and more. But does it mean ignoring regularly scheduled content? Now, The War Within Season 1 started about six weeks ago — certainly long enough for big-name guilds to clear Mythic Nerub-ar Palace and/or earn Keystone Master (if not Keystone Hero) by now, right? Well, a large portion of the player base (my guild included) is still progressing in through Heroic for Ahead of the Curve, and we’ll probably be working on it for a while longer.Does this mean anniversary content is a distraction from progression? Not really.Blackrock Depths and Classic Timewalking should be a source of equivalent upgrades — you’re not missing out on gear by running the limited-time content. Additionally, the chance to earn Tier 2 appearances and a collection of cosmetics matching Blizzard Service Awards is a delight for any transmog fiend. The War Within will still be there when the celebration wraps up, ready to pull me back into its spidery embrace (ew).Having this many choices isn’t a bad problem. The anniversary event is super exciting and marks 18 years in Azeroth for me (yes, my account is old enough to vote). It’s just also hard to remember in the face of anticipatory FOMO and choice paralysis that WoW is a game I play for fun at the end of the day, and I should do what activities I enjoy without agonizing over missing out.Either way, the content machine grinds forward and drags us along whether or not we’re ready. TWW Season 2 will be here before we know it, even if it seems like we just started Season 1! Enjoy the anniversary, play what brings you happiness, and remember to take a few deep breaths somewhere in there if you start panicking because video games are not worth that level of stress.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: The War Within Season 1, World Of Warcraft 20th AnniversaryAdvertisement Does this mean anniversary content is a distraction from progression?
