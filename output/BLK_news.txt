Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Javier Milei’s right-wing government is racking up new debt with the IMF. It’s part of a vicious cycle the country seems unable to break. Buenos Aires—The Basilica de San José de Flores didn’t appear in most guidebooks to Argentina prior to 2013. Located in a working-class neighborhood of Buenos Aires, its current structure was completed in 1883 by the Italian architects Emilio Lombardo and Benito Panuzzi, just off Plaza General Pueyrredón. Although its interior is ornate, with ubiquitous gold leaf, the church is a modest structure, with a small apse and sanctuary, and several dozen rows of well-worn pews stretching across its nave. In the years since Jorge Mario Bergoglio became pope, however, the basilica has become a minor tourist attraction. It was here that Francis attended service during his infancy and adolescence, and here that he ultimately decided to dedicate his life to God. On April 21, hundreds of Argentines packed the church for evening mass and to pay their respects to the newly departed pontiff. Inside, the vestibule was standing room only, and the air was thick with the smells of perfume, body odor, and the faint aroma of incense. The crowd was solemn but unified, holding each other’s hands (or in my case, a finger, while I clutched my notebook and phone) during the recitation of “Our Father.” Outside the church, it was another story entirely. Shortly after the mass’s completion, Argentine Vice President Victoria Villarruel beat a hasty exit down the basilica’s steps with a security detail to loud and increasingly raucous calls of “traitor.” For an instant, it felt as though she might be physically assaulted. A separate brawl would erupt several minutes later, although by then the vice president was long gone. “It’s a tragedy,” reflected Andrea Prado, a 52-year-old sociologist from Buenos Aires province, after the dust-up. “[In Francis], we’ve lost one of the last great humanists and advocates for the poor. Now the far right gets to cover up all the atrocities that it’s committing. This is the best thing that could have happened to [Argentine President Javier] Milei.” Less than 18 months since the self-styled anarcho-capitalist took office, Argentina finds itself in a political, economic, and social torpor. Monthly inflation has fallen sharply, from 25.5 percent in January 2024 to 3.7 percent in March of this year; so has the poverty rate, from 52.9 percent in the first six months of 2024 to 38.9 percent at year’s end. Yet both figures are somewhat misleading. Inflation jumped in early 2024 after a series of tax cuts and unfunded spending measures from the outgoing Peronist government, and then skyrocketed, along with poverty, on the heels of an 18 percent currency devaluation in August 2024 and another 54 percent currency devaluation that Milei announced two days after assuming power. That has set his administration up to harvest some low-hanging fruit; a March report from the Institute of Socioeconomic Statistics and Trends in Córdoba province found that “social indicators continue to show no significant improvement.” Across the country, the most popular television series is an adaptation of H.G. Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López’s classic comic El Eternauta—a sci-fi survival saga set in a post-apocalyptic Buenos Aires. Salaries and pensions have stabilized in dollar terms, but the former has failed to keep pace with inflation, while the latter has lagged well below the breadline. (Last September, the Argentine president used his veto power to nullify a pension increase.) At the same time, the government has taken to violently suppressing its retirees, who protest its draconian austerity measures each Wednesday in front of Congress. Now, after mandating a loan via executive order before a deal was even in place, Milei and Economy Minister Luis Caputo have taken on even more debt with the International Monetary Fund in the form of a $20 billion line of credit. That the IMF is extending an economic lifeline to an outspoken Trump ally at the United States’ behest seems indisputable. More devastating for Argentina and liberal democracies more broadly is that few within a politically exhausted opposition can articulate any plausible alternative to this rigged game—one whose rules are being bent in real time to the cruelty and caprice of a fractious but empowered far-right international. “Thinking about alternatives to this scenario is its own form of trap,” explained Itai Hagman, a congressman representing the city of Buenos Aires and an economic adviser to former Peronist presidential hopeful Juan Grabois. “Milei inherited a complicated macroeconomic and social situation, but it was his own decisions that have left him between a rock and a hard place. If it weren’t for the bloodletting at the beginning of 2024 or the record exchange rate appreciation and depletion of Central Bank reserves in the second half of the year to maintain the value of the peso, the government could have avoided falling into the clutches of the IMF, which is, by definition, a lender of last resort.” On April 12, the IMF Executive Board formally approved an Extended Fund Facility arrangement with Argentina—the 23rd in the nation’s history—with an immediate disbursement of $12.3 billion. The loan, at least in theory, is meant to help address the country’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities, which include negative foreign currency reserves and inflation running at 56 percent annually, while opening the country to international markets in a “timely” fashion, per the IMF. The following Monday, the Milei government lifted a majority of currency restrictions known locally as the cepo. These restrictions are used to protect reserves during periods of instability, but have served as an impediment to foreign investment, with many companies unwilling to navigate the country’s parallel exchange rates. In doing so, the administration has created a new floating scheme in which the dollar can be valued anywhere from 1000 to 1400 pesos. “I don’t totally get why the IMF keeps lending money to Argentina,” Michael Paarlberg, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and Bernie Sanders’s Latin America adviser during the 2020 Democratic primary, told The Nation. “I understand that it’s a major economy, and it would be bad if it went under. But it’s also the worst sovereign debtor in world history. The Fund is a little like Charlie Brown with the football.” “This pattern keeps repeating itself,” he continued. “A conservative gets into office and loads the country up with unsustainable debt. Then the Peronists return to power and either default on the debt or renegotiate it.” Just seven years earlier, during Trump’s first term, then–Argentine President Mauricio Macri secured a $57 billion loan from the IMF—the largest in the institution’s history. At the time, the Fund reasoned that this massive infusion of capital would stabilize the Argentine economy and lay the groundwork for foreign investment. Instead, the country’s GDP shrank 2.6 percent in 2018 and 2 percent in 2019 as the center-right administration implemented a series of IMF-directed austerity measures. Macri served a single, turbulent term, punctuated by multiple general strikes, before he was succeeded by the Peronist Alberto Fernández, who canceled the final $13 billion tranche of the credit line shortly after assuming office. The IMF has hardly needed to attach any strings to its latest loan. Since entering the Casa Rosada, Milei, an acolyte of Austrian economists Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, with an almost religious veneration of fiscal balance, has launched an assault on government spending on a scale that the young coders at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could only fantasize about. (Indeed, as The Nation has previously reported, the Argentine president’s slash-and-burn campaign has served as a model for Elon Musk’s embattled government task force in the United States.) At the beginning of April, the Milei administration had fired or failed to renew the contracts of more than 42,000 workers—approximately 8.4 percent of the government labor force, according to its newly forged Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation. These layoffs have included thousands of workers at the Childhood, Adolescence, and Family Secretariat, which is responsible for administering a range of welfare services. The government has also made steep cuts to public education, while axing programs designed to provide support to women escaping domestic abuse. Along with the marginalized, Milei’s cuts have been especially punishing for the elderly, who have seen medication costs balloon and pensions fail to keep pace with the increased cost of living altogether. A report earlier this year from Argentina’s Center for Political Economy (CEPA, by its Spanish acronym) found that the government spent 19 percent less on pensions in January 2025 than it did in January 2023, during the previous administration. This has led to regular demonstrations that only seem to be intensifying. On March 12, tensions finally boiled over when local football fans lent their support to the retirees’ regular protest. Police in riot gear injured more than 600 and arrested dozens while nearly killing a photographer, Pablo Grillo, who was struck in the head with a tear gas canister. The crackdown, the most violent since the crisis of 2001, has drawn criticism from human rights organizations, including Amnesty International. In May, the government raised the minimum monthly pension by 3.7 percent to just over 366,000 pesos, including a 70,000-peso bonus, or approximately $320. Milei, meanwhile, has seen his approval ratings slump to below 42 percent in the wake of a scandal known locally as “Criptogate” that cost investors in excess of $250 million after he promoted a memecoin on his X feed in February. (Congress has since formed a commission to investigate what the administration knew, and when it knew it.) A report the following month from the pollster Zuban Córdoba & Associates found that 63 percent of Argentines already held a negative view of the IMF. Every Wednesday, Ramon Piriz, 66, makes the 50-kilometer trip from Buenos Aires province to demonstrate in front of Congress. On April 16, he wore an Argentine flag tied around his neck like a cape and carried a sign that read, in Spanish, “I’ve never seen so many brave people without weapons and so many armed cowards.” A retired metallurgical worker and the father of four adult children, Piriz acknowledged that he’s struggling to make ends meet on his government pension, despite receiving more than the minimum monthly allowance. “These salaries are a misery,” he lamented. “A lot of people say that the previous government was a disaster. And it’s true, it was bad. But under Nestor and Cristina [Fernández de Kirchner], salaried employees were always earning one or two points above inflation. We lived with dignity. I should be at home with my grandkids, enjoying my retirement. I’m too old for this.” “We’re still paying the price for Macri’s enormous loan, and now Milei is taking on even more debt,” he added. “We have no idea where that money will go. All we know is that Argentina remains at the mercy of lenders like the IMF.” Jeet Heer Obituary / Juliana Spahr Obituary / Elie Mystal Elie Mystal That evening, I learned that the Argentine Federal Police had pepper-sprayed a segment of demonstrators that included several retirees. If Piriz is skeptical about the government’s latest arrangement, it’s not without reason. When the IMF engaged the Macri administration in 2018, it trampled its own bylaws by extending a loan that exceeded 50 percent of its lending capacity. That money was not used to build new schools or hospitals or to repair Argentina’s decaying infrastructure. Instead, it served to finance a capital flight from the country—another violation of the IMF’s own terms and conditions. What’s worse, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank and a onetime official in both the Treasury Department and National Security Council during Trump’s first term, subsequently acknowledged that the line of credit was a favor to one of the president’s former business partners and a right-of-center head of state seeking reelection. Seven years and one Democratic administration later, the IMF’s mask of neutrality has slipped clean off. According to an April 24 report from Bloomberg, the Fund ultimately approved its latest loan to Argentina despite “concerns” from its board of directors about extending yet another line of credit to its single biggest debtor. Prior to the latest deal, the country owed more than $40 billion to the international lender, representing approximately 30 percent of its total debt. In Bloomberg’s telling, some within the board felt the deal was “muscled through by the Fund’s management,” and that the decision was “driven more by politics than policy.” The report additionally noted that the agency may be eager to prove its political utility after the president ordered a review of the United States’ continued participation in international bodies like the IMF. Recent developments would appear to bear out these findings. On April 14, as Trump was ramping up his trade war with China and much of the world, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Buenos Aires to lend his support for the loan and offer praise for Milei’s economic reforms. A little more than a week later, Bessent went one step further, affirming that the United States would extend Argentina an Exchange Stabilization Fund directly if an “external shock” threatened the country’s economic recovery. He added that the United States was trying to “keep from happening what has happened on the African continent” with China. Two days after that, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, made an unusually political statement, urging Argentina to “stay the course” in its midterm elections this November. Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist who previously sided with a Peronist administration during its debt negotiations with the hedge fund BlackRock in 2020, was subsequently seen wearing a chain-saw pin on her lapel—a gift from Deregulation Minister Federico Sturzenegger. (Milei, who campaigned on dismantling the Argentine state, is often seen brandishing a personalized chain saw at rallies and other political events.) The Justicialist Party, which constitutes the largest opposition bloc, has since denounced the IMF director for “electoral interference,” accusing her of encouraging the Argentine people to vote for Milei’s candidates later this year. Georgieva, for her part, maintains that she was speaking to the country’s politicians. “This is a transparently political loan and an unprecedented decision on the part of the Fund,” Juan Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires, told The Nation. “The Milei administration has put out several signs that it is anti-China and pro-Trump, and this is its reward. But it goes beyond that. Argentina has undergone a new experiment in austerity, far beyond anything Macri achieved or even attempted during his term in office. I believe that the IMF and the US are convinced that if this government performs well in the midterms, its radical reforms will gain a new kind of legitimacy.” “The United States has lost its sphere of influence in Latin America,” he continued. “It’s lost control culturally, economically, and politically. No one looks at the US anymore as a beacon of democracy or a city on a hill. All it has are its military bases. There are no more carrots, only sticks. So, when a country subjugates itself to Washington like this, it’s eager to claim victory, even if it’s only symbolic.” Perhaps the remaining question, then, is whether Milei’s gamble on a US empire displaying visible signs of dementia will pay off. Can the IMF’s investment help return Argentina to something resembling economic normalcy? Or is it simply being used to prop up the peso through the next election cycle—after which some form of collapse is all but inevitable? “The fundamentals of Argentina were problematic before, and they remain problematic,” offered Ernesto Calvo, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland and a specialist in Argentina. “Growth is an issue. But I think the most significant challenge for the country is that it has no currency reserves. When the economy picks up, people start to exit by exchanging pesos for dollars. When it falters, people do the same to safeguard what they have. Eventually, not just investors but consumers and producers will run to the dollar. I don’t think anyone has any illusions that things are going to last.” “Will Milei’s policy work?” he asked rhetorically. “If you were to throw a coin a million times, it might stand on its edge once or twice and keep standing. Maybe that happens this time. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s possible.” Hagman’s assessment is more damning still. “Even if this libertarian experiment ‘succeeds’ on its own terms, it will produce an economy that is profoundly more unequal and doomed to underdevelopment.” On Saturdays, Calle Carlos H. Perette in the shantytown of Villa 31 is lined with vendors selling all manner of goods: secondhand clothing, sneakers, cleaning products, lotions, cast-off children’s toys, some of them worse for wear, and piles upon piles of fruits and vegetables. Officially, the barrio, which is among the poorest in Buenos Aires, is named for Father Carlos Mugica, a Catholic priest and social activist who was assassinated in 1974 by the infamous Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, two years before the military junta took power. Although she has lived in Villa 31 since she was 18, Viviana Rodriguez, now 53, was born and baptized in the Northern province of Jujuy. This presented a problem when she first moved to Buenos Aires. Because these baptisms were often performed in fields and small villages, she lacked the certificate required for confirmation and communion. Fortunately, a local priest was willing to perform all three acts at once. “I didn’t realize it was Bergoglio all those years ago until he died,” Rodriguez told me. “I couldn’t believe it.” When I spoke with Rodriguez in April 2024 for The Nation, she was running a comedor or soup kitchen off Calle Evita. Approximately one year later, the space remains open to the neighborhood, but it exists only as a merendero, where local children can enjoy some cookies and maybe a glass of milk. Of the neighborhood’s five soup kitchens, two have closed, and the three that remain now only offer evening snacks once a week. “They took everything. Everything,” she said of the Milei administration. “Even the small salary we collected to run the comedor.” Rodriguez noted that Villa 31 had changed dramatically over the last year. Her neighbors could no longer rely on the city’s drainage system, paint their homes bright greens and lavenders, or repair the electric cables that hang above the streets like an unruly spider web. All that funding was gone. She had also observed a sharp uptick in the number of families living on the street, as well as a mounting desperation among its residents, several of whom had resorted to cardboard collection and, in some cases, crime. Rodriguez herself acknowledged that she had begun selling empanadas to survive. “I feel as though I’m entering a depression, and I don’t know where to turn,” she said, her voice trembling. “If my debts catch up with me, it’s chaos.” Beneath the Dr. Arturo Umberto Illia highway, which runs along the edge of Villa 31 and connects the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires to the Obelisk downtown, there is a monument to Mugica, or “Padre Nacho” as Rodriguez affectionately called him, replete with a mosaic of the priest praying to the Virgin Mary. As she explained to a group of 30-some-odd volunteer students, it was here that the cura villero delivered mass. (Mugica’s remains were later moved to nearby Cristo Obrero parish at the behest of Bergoglio, then the Archbishop of Buenos Aires.) That afternoon in April, reggaeton blared across the courtyard from an unseen speaker, and two teams of women banged a soccer ball around an adjacent cancha (court). More than 50 years removed from Mugica’s murder, after a dictatorship, a triumphant return to democracy, and a backslide into authoritarianism, with 11 IMF deals in between, Argentina’s future still looked very much like its past.

Title: A once-niche market for secondhand stakes in private funds is booming. What it's like to work in secondaries.

There's one corner of the private investment world benefiting from the Trump bump going bust: Secondaries. "Secondaries" professionals buy stakes in privately held funds from investors looking to cash out early. They have been busy of late, closing a record $162 billion in deals last year, according to asset manager BlackRock. Demand could ratchet up again this year as investors look to raise cash to protect against the financial fallout of some of Trump's policies. "I always joke there aren't any bad times for secondaries," Matthew Roche, a partner at secondaries firm StepStone told BI. "There are some really good times for secondaries, and this is one of them." Uncertainty around Trump's tariffs has slowed already sluggish dealmaking, which is expected to lead to even more private equity investors looking to exit funds that have yet to make distributions. Large investors could also turn to the secondaries market to raise cash in the face of a volatile stock market It's not just tariffs. The endowments of Harvard and Yale are in the process of selling private equity stakes amid a federal crackdown on university funding. While Harvard's sales process began last fall, according to someone with knowledge of the sale, and Yale said it's been in process "for many months," the sales come at a time of growing uncertainty for university finances. As this niche industry takes center stage, it raises questions about the people and firms behind the deals. What firms specialize in secondaries investments? What is the job like, and how does it differ from other financial industry jobs? We spoke to investors, recruiters, and a lawyer with deep secondaries experience to understand what private equity's hottest strategy does every day. The secondary market has existed almost as long as private equity itself, but it was long viewed as a fringe strategy. Nowadays, it's considered a core strategy, making up the bulk of assets for some firms, including French private equity firm Ardian, which boasts the world's largest secondaries platform, north of $97 billion in assets managed. Other key players include Lexington Partners, HarbourVest, and StepStone. It's also become a must-have strategy for any megafund, with Apollo raising $5.4 billion in a debut fund that closed this year. Blackstone, which acquired its secondaries business, Strategic Partners, from Credit Suisse in 2013, is now the second-largest secondaries investor in the world. Goldman Sachs' asset management unit also has a fund. Secondaries investors are a category of private-equity professional, but rather than finding companies to turn around, they are responsible for locating, assessing, and executing private fund transactions, sometimes with the help of investment banks like Evercore or Jefferies. Like other private equity pros, they are using money raised from investors. The secondaries industry raised a record $50 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Preqin. The goal is to buy shares at a discount to their future value. The traditional secondaries deal is led by investors looking to cash out. These deals are known as "LP-led" deals. Increasingly, the industry has been transacting deals on behalf of buyout firm sponsors, known as "GP-led" deals, as more private equity firms struggle to make distributions to impatient investors. The secondaries business is "fast-paced," said Keith Brittain, cohead of Hamilton Lane's $24 billion secondaries platform. It's not high-frequency trading, as deals can take weeks or months from start to finish, but there are many more transactions in secondaries than in the world of corporate buyouts. "Even in a two-year associate program at a traditional large/mega fund buyout, you're lucky if you get to see one deal from start to finish," said Alix Connors, a principal at recruiting firm Opus Advisors. Roche said some incoming associates at StepStone came to the firm for a change of pace "Our recent junior hires appreciate that every day can be different: different sponsors, different sectors, and different companies, with many active deals at all times," Roche said. Holly McCarthy, founder of Opus Advisors, compared the workload to a "sample platter" of "sizes, sectors, and strategies.""You can work on a tech venture deal in the morning, a megafund buyout deal by lunch, and a real estate deal in the afternoon," McCarthy said. Secondaries can also offer a bit more work-life balance than corporate buyout investing. "You have a bit more control over your calendar," McCarthy said. Connors said buyouts can be a bit like "banking 2.0" with a highly demanding, intense workload. Secondaries offer more "predictability," she said, though the recent increase in activity has likely led to longer hours. And while the pay is below that of a buyout fund star, it's not by much. "You might earn slightly less, but the trade-off in deal reps and lifestyle is worth it," McCarthy said. But don't expect that you're going to always be home for dinner. Schedules can still be "inconsistent," said Brittain. "Like many transaction and investment-oriented jobs, you don't always have control of timelines." The secondary investor is focused primarily on financial modeling, research, and closing deals. It's for those who want to underwrite versus meeting with CEOs and running businesses. Brittain said secondary investors who buy a share of a fund must do financial due diligence on the overall fund, including the deals in the fund and the private equity manager. On the GP-led side, diligence is even more thorough. "You're not underwriting 20 assets or 200 assets, you're underwriting one or a small number of companies," Brittain said. You also get a chance to look under the hood of other private equity firms."You have to underwrite the quality of the GP," Brittain said. "Can they buy well? Can they exit well?" Jump to

Title: Finally, the BOAK (after decades), K.M. and Meloni for trains, Greek companies in Turkey, where Ethniki is looking to buy, the Indian competitors of Aegean

Hello, so just to say something positive for a change, after a few decades the BOAK is finally being signed today in Crete with lights and torches (GEK TERNA) in the presence of Mitsotakis—I imagine that since it’s nearby, he’ll also pop over to his house in Chania for a swim. Announcements on Monday Meanwhile, Kyriakos Kyranakis’s visit yesterday at noon to the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Salvini and the inspection he then conducted at Italian railway facilities have a rich backstory, but announcements are expected to be made on Monday by Mitsotakis and Meloni from Palazzo Chigi, at the rescheduled Intergovernmental Conference between the two countries. In any case, Kyranakis’s request to his counterpart was for the Italians to seriously invest in new train sets, while the Italians, in turn, are asking us to invest in the network and in safety standards. The consequences for the Rectors I wrote to you yesterday about the government interventions in the universities, but let me add one more piece of information: the deadline for rectors to submit safety plans for their universities is the end of July. Also, by the end of the year they must have drawn up Internal Regulations, which are essentially the constitutional charter of a university. Rectors who don’t “play ball” will face administrative sanctions, even pay cuts, if they choose to resist, although the Ministry of Education estimates that a common ground will be found. The mission to Turkey Deputy Foreign Minister Tasos Chatzivasileiou has been in Istanbul since yesterday; today he will meet with his counterpart Mehmet Kemal Bozay, and then the two of them will address the Greece–Turkey Business Conference. The organization of the conference is being handled by Enterprise Greece, the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, SEV, SEVE, and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, while Mr. Chatzivasileiou is accompanied by top executives from major players in Greek business. Among others, there are representatives from Metlen, Base Metal of the HALCOR group, Europa Aluminium, Swissport, Elbak, Pobuca, and Sky Express. The National Bank, the next step, and the dilemma That the National Bank of Greece is preparing an acquisition move aimed at boosting its revenues in anticipation of further interest rate cuts is well known and already priced in by the market. Efforts in domestic asset management don’t seem to be yielding results. At the same time, glances toward Italy (from all banks) haven’t produced any outcome, as entry into the Italian banking market is neither easy nor straightforward, while the insurance sector—currently in turmoil—is proving more accessible. Ergo and NN appear more receptive, especially the former, which has caught the eye of more than one bank, and Groupama could also be a viable option. One issue complicating matters for the National Bank is the special rights held by the state, namely the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), which remain in place despite the reduction of its stake from 40.4% to 8.39%. The National Bank isn’t worried about whether it will happen or not, because there is a vague initial “OK” from the ESM. However, the relevant legislative provision must be drafted, the ESM must agree to it, and then it must pass through Parliament. The problem is that acquisitions are typically handled within a tight circle of top management—at most three to five executives, such as the CEO, the CFO, etc. But the special rights of the state involve the HCAP board members in the plan, thus widening the circle, since advisors, lawyers, and others are already in the game alongside the bank executives. In mergers and acquisitions, however, you are obliged to act quickly to close the initial deal. In such a case, you take the risk of convincing the special-rights shareholder after the fact, who views the matter from their own (different) perspective and won’t be especially happy if they feel they’ve been ignored. Avramar’s “overcoat” and Amerra’s obstacles We’ve entered May and the sale of Avramar to the Arabs of Aqua Bridge remains pending. The UAE fund and the selling banks initially expected to have a deal by the end of April or early May, but it is said that Amerra Capital, the other shareholder along with Mubadala, is creating obstacles. The American capital initially acquired Andromeda from Global Finance and then, together with Mubadala, bought Nireus and Selonda to form Avramar, the biggest player in Mediterranean aquaculture. Amerra and its executives ran Avramar and drove it onto the rocks, prompting the banks to step in again to find a buyer. And while Aqua Bridge is waiting, Amerra reportedly is setting conditions that are hard to accept. Logically, a solution will be found and it’s said to be near, as all sides want the matter to be concluded smoothly. The good news is that under the new management, things have gotten back on track and Avramar has stabilized, increasing its revenues and improving its metrics. Dividend and forecasts for Aegean Aegean’s stock is steadily climbing, reaching 12-month highs and closing yesterday at €12.70. The airline is benefiting, among other factors, from the positive start to the tourism season and from declining oil prices. Management wants to capitalize on the momentum, which remains positive despite broader international uncertainties, and this year will increase its offered capacity by 1.9 million seats in 2025—a growth rate higher than the European industry average. For the full year, AEGEAN plans to offer 21.5 million seats, with routes spanning 47 countries and 249 destinations. Naturally, there’s also the dividend factor, with Aegean standing out among listed companies by distributing €0.80 per share (€0.76 net), representing a gross yield of over 6%, one of the highest on the board. In a few days, specifically on Tuesday 20/5, the ex-dividend date is set, and payment will begin on 26/5. Aegean’s Indian Competitor And since we are on the topic of Aegean, I should mention that the airline’s management plans to enter the Indian market by the end of 2026 will not be a walk in the park. Aegean’s plans for this particular route will have to contend with the presence of a competitor. The Indian airline IndiGo also intends to start flights to and from Athens in 2026. It is a low-cost carrier based near New Delhi that serves 63% of passenger traffic in India. The company’s CEO, Peter Elbers, is in Athens and even met with Kyriakos Mitsotakis yesterday. IndiGo does not currently operate flights to EU airports, and its first European presence will begin in Athens, with Geneva as a second target. Additionally, note that it expects to take delivery of new A321 aircraft. OPAP Confirms Its Reputation OPAP’s stock is a classic investment choice for those who believe in steady economic growth and expect high dividend returns. One of the characteristics of OPAP’s stock behavior so far is that whenever it “cuts” a dividend, the stock drops for a few sessions, allowing investors to increase their positions at a lower price, only for the stock to regain its momentum shortly afterward. This is exactly what happened last Monday ahead of the distribution of the remaining dividend (€0.80 per share) for 2024. The stock declined, providing an opportunity for those who wanted to invest at a lower price, and as of yesterday, it returned to €19.40 with a market capitalization of €7.2 billion. Bank Guarantees, the Eldorado for Insurance Companies The explosive increase in large public works assignments, aided by the Development Fund, the NSRF, and the Public Investment Program (PIP), has created a demand for the issuance of bank guarantees, which are necessary for taking on these projects. While banks play a leading role in issuing guarantees, recently insurance companies with strong reinsurance backing and the necessary licensing (notable examples include Interamerican and Europa Insurance) have also increased their participation in issuing guarantees. There are also other examples, such as the smaller Euroins Insurance, which belongs to the Eurohold Group. Over the last 7 months, Euroins has changed its management structure, appointed Greek CEO Angeliki Mouratidou, quickly restructured its automobile insurance department—its core activity—and focused on guaranteeing smaller projects, which has boosted turnover by 30% compared to last year, as well as profitability. The New Investment Fund of the HCAP Its name is IIF (Infrastructure & Innovation Fund), and it will be the new specialized subsidiary of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), aimed at investing in key economic sectors of Greece, particularly in infrastructure, innovative businesses, green transition, and digitalization of the economy. Bureaucratic procedures are being finalized, the absorption of the HCAP portfolio was slightly more complicated than initially planned, but by early June, the IIF will begin operations, initially with a capital of €303.5 million, derived from the transfer of EYATH S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thessaloniki) and EYDAP S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Athens) back to the state. There are also plans for new sources of funding. The new IIF will operate as a subsidiary of Growthfund, with independent governance, management, and investment decisions, and BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (“BlackRock FMA”) will be its strategic advisor. BlackRock FMA has significant experience in investment and asset management, risk management, and technology, as well as extensive knowledge in advising institutional entities on capital markets issues. Trump’s Tariff Policy Benefited Germany’s Exports Since the “day of liberation,” the world has been living in great uncertainty regarding the tariffs that President Trump would eventually impose on imported goods and services in the U.S. As expected, ahead of the potential tariff imposition, the U.S. market rushed to accelerate imports and stock up in order to benefit from the transition period. The first beneficiary of this new situation was… the German economy. Germany’s trade surplus jumped sharply to €21.1 billion in March, from €18 billion in February. This surge was driven by an increase in exports, as businesses rushed to send goods before the expected U.S. tariffs were imposed. German exports rose by 1.1% on a monthly basis, while imports fell by 1.4%. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. was the top destination for German exports, which increased by 2.4% from February, as American buyers accelerated purchases to avoid potential tariff hikes. First Bank Product for Trump’s Tariffs HSBC announced that it had developed a new loan product specifically targeted at U.S. companies struggling to cover the costs of Trump’s tariffs, which have disrupted global supply chains. HSBC is offering working capital to businesses facing pressure on their cash flows due to higher import costs and supply chain disruptions. The bank is also providing support for businesses in managing the immediate financial impacts of tariffs, while they adjust their procurement strategies and re-route their supply chains before passing on costs to consumers. The loan offers flexible repayment terms and a tailored risk assessment, recognizing the heightened uncertainty in global trade. The False Image of Market Indices – 42% of Russell 2000 Companies Are in Losses We daily read and hear about the spectacular rise of indices in Wall Street’s stock markets. However, these indices only reflect a part of the U.S. economic reality, namely the large and powerful (primarily technological) business conglomerates. For smaller-cap stocks, Wall Street is not as generous. The truth is that the new tariff regime, regardless of the final amount, will primarily hurt small-cap companies and small businesses. Futures contracts predict further declines, as investors bet on additional drops in small-cap stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs, in addition to economic slowdown and higher interest rates. Around 42% of companies in the Russell 2000 index are reporting losses, and this percentage is even higher than during the 2008 financial crisis. Explore related questions

Title: Chinese companies bought up European ports — and now Brussels is starting to worry

Chinese firms own stakes in about 30 European ports, and that’s raising security concerns. AI generated Text-to-speech Europe is getting twitchy about who owns its ports, with mounting anxiety driven by the outsized footprint of Chinese firms across the bloc’s maritime gateways. Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas on Thursday told industry leaders that Europe’s ports must “reconsider security … and examine foreign presence more carefully.” It was one of the clearest signals yet from Brussels that what once was seen as a benign investment is now starting to look like a security liability. The Commission’s recent defense white paper echoed that concern by floating the idea of stricter controls on foreign ownership of “critical transport infrastructure.” That unease is mirrored in a draft paper from the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, seen by POLITICO, which calls for tougher rules in the upcoming overhaul of the EU’s foreign investment screening regulation. Neither Tzitzikostas nor the S&D mentioned China by name, but the subtext wasn’t exactly subtle. Simon Van Hoeymissen, a researcher at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defense, said the language likely nods to Beijing’s expanding hold over key European ports — from Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam to Piraeus in Greece. Chinese giants COSCO and China Merchants, as well as Hong Kong-based Hutchison now hold stakes in more than 30 terminals across the EU. ‍“The reality is clear,” said Ana Miguel Pedro, a Portuguese MEP with the center-right European People's Party. A member of the Parliament’s Seas, Rivers, Islands & Coastal Areas Intergroup, she warned that “foreign state-driven actors like Beijing are operating with a level of coordination and intent that far exceeds the fragmented response of individual countries.” Pedro argued COSCO isn’t behaving like a typical market actor but is taking orders from the Chinese Communist Party. “Its growing presence in ports is not just an economic concern,” she said. “It’s a strategic vulnerability.” The EU is starting to see it that way, too. "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s unofficial support for Russia have only heightened concerns about the security of the EU’s ports," says a recent report from the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern Studies think tank. One example of the kind of strategic entanglement the EU is now confronting is playing out in Poland, at the Gdynia Container Terminal, where Hutchison has held a stake for over 20 years. That situation could change. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants Chinese-linked companies out of the Panama Canal, Hutchison is negotiating a $23 billion sale of port properties worldwide, including 14 in Europe, to a consortium led by BlackRock and including Mediterranean Shipping Company. However, that deal hit a wall in March after Beijing intervened. What makes Gdynia especially revealing isn’t just the trade it handles — it’s what sits next door: a naval base, a shipyard, and the headquarters of Poland’s elite naval special forces, meaning that whoever runs the terminal holds a front-row seat to European and NATO military logistics and defense operations. Recognizing the strategic significance, the Polish government has listed the terminal as critical infrastructure, meaning the operator has to work closely with the government on security. This high-stakes backdrop sharpens the edge of Pedro’s warning — and underscores why the EU is now reassessing foreign involvement in its ports with renewed urgency. “If a foreign adversary exploits a vulnerability in one European port, it jeopardizes all of us,” she said. “In today’s world, we cannot afford strategic blindness while others act with full visibility and intent.” Europe has built its war-fighting plans on speeding American reinforcements to the front lines. The prospect of that not happening is throwing military mobility plans into disarray. The project aims to make it easier to move troops and equipment between Poland and the Baltic countries.

(Getty Images: PA Images/John Walton) The British and Irish Lions squad has been announced for the upcoming tour of Australia, ending months of speculation about who would be named. England's Maro Itoje will captain the British and Irish Lions on their tour of Australia later this year, as Andy Farrell announced his touring squad. The 38-strong touring party features 15 Ireland players, 13 from England, eight from Scotland and just two from Wales. That is the lowest number of Wales players to make a Lions squad since before World War II. Of those 15 Ireland players, 12 play for Dublin-based Leinster. England's lock Maro Itoje is captain on what is his third tour with the Lions. Coach Andy Farrell, the Englishman in charge of Ireland, had some desperately tough choices to make, but has selected a very strong squad to tour Down Under. Here's the list of players rugby fans will become acquainted with over the next couple of months. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 75 caps (3 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Perth, SCO | 188cm/126kg A Glasgow Warriors stalwart, Fagerson is one of the most-reliable performers in Scotland's ever-improving side. Never one to take a backward step, the west coast product is the sort of player that you want to have in your side, which is where he will likely be if there's any possibility of things getting out of hand. However, a calf injury he suffered in the lead-up to Glasgow's URC match against Zebra did put his touring participation in doubt, with Warriors coach Franco Smith telling reporters that the issue would rule him out until late June. Leinster & Ireland | 79 caps (5 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Wexford, IRE | 183cm/119kg Tadhg Furlong is one of the premier tight head props in the world, so there was never a doubt that he would be named to his third Lions touring team. Or was there? The 32-year-old missed all but one of Ireland's underwhelming Six Nations campaign and its entire series of autumn internationals with troublesome hamstring and calf injuries, playing just 33 minutes of international rugby since July last year. Battling these re-occurring injuries has been tough and there has to be an acceptance that his body is not capable of the repeat efforts it was in his 20s. But this monster of a presence in the front row has earned his spot on tour despite the lack of game time in recent months and will likely be a pillar of strength come Test time too. Bristol Bears & England | 71 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Bristol, ENG | 187cm/116kg Ellis Genge is passion personified in an England shirt — and you'd expect the Bristolian to bring all that and more Down Under with the Lions as well. A man who walks the walk as much as he talks the talk, Genge is as mobile as they come and a hugely impressive scrummager to boot, adding yet another mark to the Lions' impressive scrum stocks on this tour — in 2022 he was named World Rugby loosehead prop of the year. Genge scored one of his rare international tries against the Wallabies in Perth in 2022, albeit in a 28-30 defeat, but will have happy memories of that tour as Eddie Jones's tourists secured a 2-1 series victory. Leinster & Ireland | 75 caps (6 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Dublin, IRE | 183cm/123kg One of the hardest-working players on the field, Leinster stalwart Andrew Porter was tireless throughout Ireland's Six Nations campaign. He hit 99 rucks — 22 more than any other prop — and made 52 tackles in the Championship — one of just two props to pass 50. Porter was named to tour with the Lions in 2021 but did not make it to South Africa after suffering a toe injury in the lead-up. He will see this as being an opportunity to make up for lost time and the missed opportunity that got away from him through no fault of his own four years ago. Edinburgh & Scotland | 42 caps (6 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Mbombela, RSA | 180cm/118kg One of Scotland's South Africa-born contingent, Schoeman has confirmed himself as one of Scotland's key performers as Gregor Townsend's boys raised themselves into the conversation. A former Springbok U20 international and ex-skipper of the Springbok schoolboys team, Schoeman made his debut for Scotland in 2021 after qualifying on residency grounds, having moved to Edinburgh in 2018. A monster at scrum time and devastating in the loose, it's easy to see why Schoeman is a fan favourite north of Hadrian's Wall and could be in with a very decent shout of wearing the number one jersey in Brisbane when the first Test comes around. Bath & England | 50 caps (3 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, London, ENG | 189cm/127kg Will Stuart had a superb Six Nations campaign for England, pushing his case with a number of assured displays. Given that the tight-head was under enormous pressure to keep his spot in the England team after a very disappointing tour of New Zealand that saw him left off the list of centrally contracted players, his resurgence has been all the more impressive. Starting at the back end of 2024, England's scrum has gone from strength-to-strength, devastating their opponents in the close confines of hand-to-hand combat that typifies the tight five. An ancient history buff who acknowledges he's happier with a lower profile than some of his front row partners, Stuart is a deserving tourist and should make his mark in the Test team. Sale Sharks & England | 49 caps (9 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 31yo, Truro, ENG | 183cm/111kg The Cornish hooker started out life in rugby as a prop before moving into the centre of the front row, where he excelled for both club and country. It's not been an easy path though, even accounting for the fact that he had former captain Jamie George to contend with for the number two jersey for England. After being one of the best hookers in the world through 2021, injury forced Cowan-Dickie to undergo neck surgery in 2023 that affected nerves in his arm for over a year. He then had a scare during a match for Sale when his heart skipped a beat … atrial fibrillation. A two-time Six Nations winner and a member of the 2019 Rugby World Cup squad that finished as runner-up, Cowan-Dickie has since given up drinking and playing Call of Duty — a game for which he was ranked as number one in the world for a short time. Leinster & Ireland | 39 caps (8 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 27yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/111kg A tourist in 2021, initially as non-travelling cover but eventually as a full-blown replacement, Kelleher's inclusion says as much about Leinster's strength in depth as it does his own abilities. Indeed, ABC Sport had Kelleher as the best-performing hooker through the first two rounds of this year's Six Nations, before Sheehan returned from injury and was judged best for the final three weeks of the campaign. When Dan Sheehan suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2024, Kelleher was a more than ample replacement for both club and country. The two twos may as well come as a package deal and will continue to share duties at all levels. Leinster & Ireland | 32 caps (15 tries) | Lions tour debut 26yo, Dublin, IRE | 191cm/111kg The most-prolific try-scoring forward in Six Nations history, Sheehan crossed the line five times in the course of the Championship this year, including a hat-trick against Italy. The Dublin lad has had his share of setbacks in his career, including an ACL injury in 2024, but never let that get him down. His return to the Leinster side saw him score two tries against the Stormers and he stepped up to captain Ireland during this year's Six Nations in the absence of Caelan Doris. A reliable lineout thrower and busier than any in the loose, Sheehan had stamped his ticket to Australia long before the squad was eventually named. Munster & Ireland | 61 caps (12 tries) | 2 Lions Test caps (2021) 33yo, Eadestown, Co Kildare, IRE | 198cm/113kg The Munster skipper made his international bow for Ireland's senior team against Australia in 2018, helping the squad to a historic 2-1 victory. In fact, in three Tests against Australia for Ireland he has never been on the losing side. The ex-Leinster and Scarlets man will be hoping for something similar when he dons the red of the British and Irish Lions. A stellar performer who can also play in the back row if required, Beirne has twice been named in the World Rugby men's team of the year in the second row. During the Six Nations, Beirne and Andrew Porter both received abuse for an incident that saw Antoine Dupont rupture his ACL, with France coach Fabien Galthie particularly passionate. However, Beirne was adamant that there was no malice and it was just an unfortunate incident at a clean-out of a ruck. Leicester Tigers & England | 28 caps (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Boston, ENG | 201cm/118kg Following an 11-month injury lay-off, Ollie Chessum was brought straight back into England's Six Nations squad, underlining the high esteem the Lincolnshire man is held by Steve Borthwick — who should know a thing or two about being an international lock. Chessum's reaction to those back-to-back injuries to his shoulder and knee impressed his Australian coach at Leicester, Michael Cheika, who praised his attitude to rehab. A giant of a man, Chessum has been a feature of England's second row but can also be used in the back row if required. Glasgow Warriors & Scoland | 42 caps (2 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, Glasgow, SCO | 198cm/116kg Capped at almost every level by Scotland, Cummins was first selected in the senior squad by Gregor Townsend in 2017 but did not make his debut in the senior team until 2019. A long wait, but worth it for the Glaswegian, who has since made himself an integral member of the Scotland side. Cummins was in the spotlight in 2024 when he was sent off against South Africa for an innocuous-looking clean-out at a ruck. His absence from the squad through a broken arm for the 2025 edition was keenly felt for a Scotland team that somewhat stalled in their development. Saracens & England | 93 caps (8 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 30yo, London, ENG | 195cm/118kg A man writing himself into the history books as one of England's all-time greats. Itoje, named skipper of England for this year's Championships, was the only man to play in every minute of every game as England managed a heartening second-place finish behind France. A man who leads by example, whose performances simply demand respect whether it's for Saracens, England, or the Lions. This will be his third Lions tour and, given he has played in every Test on the previous two tours he's been on with the Lions, expect his name to be among the first on the team sheet this time around as well and add his list to the great locks of the past, like Willie John McBride and Alun Wyn Jones. Leinster & Ireland | 93 caps (8 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Manhattan, USA | 198cm/124kg One of Ireland and Leinster's key performers in the second row over the last few years, McCarthy is a giant of a man who made his international debut against the Wallabies in 2022. He didn't have the most impactful Six Nations campaign, but has been impressive domestically for Leinster. Discipline is going to be a hot topic on tour, and one that McCarthy will need to be careful about. In a later match against the Wallabies, the New York-born, Ireland-raised lock left quite the impression on Rob Valetini in Dublin last year, when he clashed heads with the Aussie forward only to escape punishment from the officials. McCarthy was penalised with a sin-binning though for pulling back Thomas Ramos in Dublin during the Six Nations, which allowed the French to capitalise and run away with the win. It was a rare card for a team that had taken great pride in its discipline over the past few years and the sort of issue teams cannot afford to give away in tight Test matches. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland | 203cm/124kg Another monster of a lock who has been a stalwart in the Leinster and Ireland back row for a number of years. In fact, current Wallabies coach Joe Schimdt thought so highly of Ryan that he handed him his full international debut before he had suited up for Leinster, becoming the first player since 2012 to play for his country before his province. His inclusion was vindicated — he scored a try on debut. Many of the squad have leadership credentials and Ryan is no exception, captaining the Ireland under 20s to a runners-up finish at the 2016 world championship — Ireland's best-ever position. His talkative nature to referees eventually led to him being replaced, but don't expect that will stop him from muttering a few words out on the field. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (13 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 32yo, Bray, Co Wicklow, Ireland | 193cm/124kg A fixture of the Leinster team for more than a decade, Conan is an immense runner in the loose, who is also a furious presence in defence, earning the joint-highest number of turnovers of anyone in the Ireland squad throughout the Six Nations despite mostly playing off the bench. Comfortable anywhere in the back three, he scored tries against Scotland, Wales and France, as well as being a key factor in the second-half surge that accounted for England. It is off the bench where Conan can be most effective, acknowledging that during the week being a squad member in modern rugby is vital. Another player who has had to return from almost a year out of the game — in part due to missing the 2024 summer tour for the arrival of his first child — Conan suffered a shoulder injury in the Six Nations but he has since recovered. Sale Sharks & England | 61 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, London, ENG | 185cm/109kg There were very few players who performed as consistently well throughout the Six Nations as Tom Curry. Starting every game for England, his stunning work rate in both attack and defence were impossible to ignore by anyone watching. Perhaps most impressively though was the stunning display he produced in Cardiff, where he embarrassed his opposite number and Lions jersey frontrunner Jac Morgan in a devastating display, all in front of coach Andy Farrell. Don't back against him adding to his three Lions caps despite the impossible strength in depth of the back row across the British Isles. Saracens & England | 42 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 27yo, Redhill, ENG | 183cm/107kg Another of the stellar England backrow unit who simply doesn't know what fatigue is — or at least plays that way. No England player had more carries than Earl through the Six Nations, with the Saracens man taking all 63 of them into contact — second only to Blair Kinghorne in his propensity to hit tacklers. Earl also made more tackles than any other England player, no mean feat given how the entire loose forward contingent hunted in packs. He also stole five balls at the breakdown, equal most of all England players with Ben Curry, and made a turnover tackle as well. You know what you're going to get if you pick Ben Earl, a whirlwind of power and willingness. Ospreys & Wales | 24 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 25yo, Swansea, WAL | 182cm/105kg By the end of the Six Nations, Wales skipper Jac Morgan looked absolutely exhausted. That's understandable. He had played every minute of Wales's sorry campaign, making more tackles (92) than anyone else in the tournament, hitting more rucks than anyone bar Gregory Alldritt and doing it all while carrying his misfiring teammates on his back. It would not have gone unnoticed that Morgan had his worst display of the tournament in the humiliation at the hands of England in Cardiff, where he was comprehensively outplayed by his direct opponent for a Lions starting berth, Ben Curry. Wales has a fine heritage when it comes to the Lions, and although the number of tourists from Wales is paltry compared to recent years, in Morgan they have at least provided one of the best. Northampton Saints & England | 1 cap (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 20yo, Banbury, ENG | 186cm/100kg Get used to this name, because it's one you're going to be hearing a lot of in rugby circles over the next few years. Bruising and combative back row forwards are 10-a-penny in rugby union, and yet there is still something a little bit special about this youngster. Having captained England at under 18 and under 20 level — the latter of which saw him lift the 2024 under 20 Rugby World Championship — Pollock roared into senior team contention after starring for England A against Australia in London in November last year. He made his senior debut off the bench in Cardiff as England romped to a belting victory against their arch nemesis, with Pollock scoring twice. His display against Leinster in Dublin for the Saints showed that he loves the limelight, laying down tackles on his senior rivals and scoring a wonderful try that embarrassed Sam Prendergast to such an extent that it may have been the deciding moment that saw him missing the trip. Every tour needs a bolter and Pollock has proven with his stellar performances this year that he is more than up to the task. Leinster & Ireland | 73 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Wicklow, IRE | 186cm/103kg Despite the name suggesting otherwise, Josh van der Flier is not one of the South African exiles playing in Europe. In fact, he's of Dutch stock, and was born and raised in Wicklow south of Dublin. A keen thinker — he has a masters degree from Dublin Business School — van der Flier has been one of Ireland's best for a number of years, winning the World Rugby player of the year award in 2022 and being named player of the series for the 2024 November internationals. Nobody in an Ireland shirt made more tackles than him in the Six Nations, nor hit as many rucks as he did. Leinster & Ireland | 43 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 33yo, Great Barrier Island, NZ | 175cm/80kg A player who cut his teeth playing for Taranaki in the National Provincial Championships across the ditch, Jamison Gibson-Park was considered one of the rising stars of New Zealand rugby. As a 20-year-old he was selected for the Māori All Blacks in 2012, before going on to play Super Rugby for the Blues and Hurricanes. Staying in New Zealand though, was not Gibson-Park's destiny, as he would move to Dublin in 2016, becoming eligible for Ireland on residency grounds in 2019. He made his Ireland debut in 2020 and has since been awarded citizenship. A shoe-in for the number nine jersey, Gibson-Park started the Six Nations brightly against England, but frankly dropped off as the tournament progressed. The Lions will want and need him on top form if they are to succeed Down Under. Northampton Saints & England | 23 caps (4 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Maidstone, ENG | 178cm/89kg An exciting, running scrum half, Alex Mitchell was involved in five tries for England in the Six Nations, second most behind Northampton teammate Tommy Freeman. And yet it is his form for Northampton that has undoubtedly got the 27-year-old Kent man on the plane. Against Leinster last week he was exceptional, leading the Saints to an unlikely European final. With Northampton providing four tourists, expect Mitchell to use his relationship with Fin Smith on the midweek team to great effect and work to get into that Test team. Gloucester & Wales | 60 caps (10 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Treorchy, WAL | 180cm/86kg There's no hiding from Wales's abysmal Six Nations campaign, but among the ashes of a once fine rugby nation, Tomos Williams still flickered. From the former mining region of the Rhondda Fawr Valley, Williams will be upholding Welsh pride on tour alongside his country skipper Jac Morgan. Given Wales's fine history with the Lions, there's no wonder he admitted to shedding a tear when he heard he had made the squad. A darting runner who honed his speed of foot and mind on the sevens circuit, the ex-Cardiff man will relish having a pack in front of him that's not going backwards at a rate of knots when he suits up for the Lions. Bath & Scotland | 85 caps (415pts, 9 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 32yo, Stirling, SCO | 182cm/87kg Mercurial. Established. Flashy. Take your pick of adjectives to describe Finn Russell. But one thing you can be sure of is his will to win. In a Six Nations tournament filled with young pretenders for the Lions 10 shirt, Russell could be considered a safe pair of hands — although the veteran did have his moments with some careless play against Ireland and some terrible goal-kicking against England. Despite those lapses Scotland has, under his guidance, developed one of the best attacking back lines in the world, albeit one that did not quite have the cutting edge he or coach Gregor Townsend would have hoped for during the Northern Hemisphere spring. He is the top scorer in the Premiership for Bath, with 148 points (five penalties, 59 conversions and three tries), which should be an indication his ability off the tee has not been dulled. With even more weapons at his disposal and a brutally strong pack ahead of him, what could Russell do for the Lions? We may not have to wonder too long. Northampton Saints & England | 11 caps (29pts) | Lions tour debut 22yo, Warwick, ENG | 178cm/87kg Just a couple of months ago nobody would have thought Fin Smith would be anything other than deserving of a cursory mention when it came to the British and Irish Lions squad — perhaps only in passing as reference to his grandfather, Tom Elliot, the Scotland prop who played eight tour games but no Tests on the 1955 Lions tour of South Africa. Yet, after a superb Six Nations and a series of magical performances for the Saints in both the Premiership and European Cup competition, young Fin forced himself into the conversation. Having been named in the Premiership team of the season and the Players Association players' player of the year in 2023/24 should have been a clue as to the trajectory his career was on, but managing to convert that domestic form into the international stage was something else. His performances up against fellow young gun, Sam Prendergast would have made a particular impression on the selection team just last week when the youngster helped guide the Saints to a hugely unexpected victory over Leinster at the Aviva Stadium in the European Cup semifinal. Harlequins & England | 44 caps (14 tries, 314pts) | Lions tourist in 2021 26yo, Manila, PHI | 175cm/82kg One of the most thrilling broken-play players in world rugby, Marcus Smith should, perhaps, feel a little fortunate that he has been included in this Lions squad. A year ago you'd have said the Harlequins man was a nailed-on starter for both the Lions and England, but with the rise of Fin Smith and a shift to fullback at international level, Marcus's stock has fallen. And yet, despite a dramatic drop-off in club form of late, there are few players in the world who can incite as much excitement as Smith does when he has his hands on the ball. Whether he plays at 15 or 10 on tour, given the amount of ball the Lions will be expected to have, he could make hay against any opponent, with his versatility potentially making him an ideal bench player for the Test team. Connacht & Ireland | 65 caps (18 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 35yo, Ōtāhuhu, NZ | 178cm/102kg It's easy to think of Bundee Aki as another of New Zealand's rugby refugees now plying his trade in Europe, but the 35-year-old veteran is so much more than that. Moving from the Chiefs fresh after winning Super Rugby to unfashionable Connacht out on Ireland's windswept west coast, Aki made the Westerners a genuine title force and even helped them win the Pro12 in 2015. As Ireland has surged, so has Aki, winning two grand slams and three Six Nations titles in total since he made his debut in 2017, after completing his three years of residency. Aki was criticised earlier in his career after admitting that he moved to Ireland primarily to play international rugby, but has embraced life so comprehensively in Galway that he has become a citizen in 2024. "I love the people, I love the culture … There's not a bad word I can speak about Ireland," Aki said upon being made a citizen. Saracens & England | 65 caps (131 points, 18 tries) | 5 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Croydon, ENG | 178cm/83kg He's listed as a centre, but in reality Elliot Daly can play just about anywhere in the back line. Immense under the high ball and a brutal attacking force, Daly will likely slot in at fullback as often as he will in the centres. His enormous boot, capable of kicking penalty goals from beyond half way, may also prove vital. Another of the backs in this squad to be in the incredibly small group of players who have played both for and against the touring side. In 2023, Daly played for the Barbarians who took on the touring Lions in Hong Kong. Since then he has gone on to play five Tests, including all three in the dramatic drawn series against New Zealand in 2021. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Leith, SCO | 186cm/102kg Scotland to England to South Africa to Scotland and now the Lions — Huw Jones's rugby life has already taken him plenty of places around the world. Born in Scotland, Jones was educated in England before moving to South Africa, where he got his first taste of professional rugby with Western Province and then the Stormers in Super Rugby. The call of home was always there though and he moved to the Glasgow Warriors where, either side of a season at Harlequins, he has remained ever since. A hard-running and skilful ball carrier whose ability to unpick a defence with lines few can see let alone defend against, Jones has been one of the stars in a backline full of them for the Scots in recent years — particularly in partnership with former Australian Sione Tuipulotu. Although he has not played since the Six Nations on account of an ankle injury, he had plenty of credit in the bank to keep his spot in the squad. Leinster & Ireland | 67 caps (77 points, 15 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, IRE | 185cm/102kg A fleet-of-foot centre who has been a fixture in the Ireland set-up since 2016, Gary Ringrose is a multiple winner at club and international level. One of the most skilled ball-handlers in the game, Ringrose has the ability to unlock defences with a hint of a swerve as much as a powerful fend. Being sent off for a high tackle against Wales — and a subsequent three-match ban — limited his international appearances this season. But there was little concern that Andy Farrell would leave one of his most dependable backs at home. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Melbourne, AUS | 179cm/104kg The Melbourne Rebels are, sadly, no more, but they will be represented in some small way at least on this year's Lions tour. A graduate of the Rebels set-up, Sione Tuipulotu felt like his Lions dream was over after he suffered a pectoral injury in January that has kept him out of action until May. Fortunately, Andy Farrell had already seen enough from this adopted Scot, who qualified for the tartan army on account of his grandmother. And it's a fitting reward for what has been a stunning rise for the Australian-born centre, who has inarguably been the heart and soul of Scotland's rise into genuine contenders in recent years as captain. In November, Tuipulotu clashed with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, so that might be one to keep an eye on Down Under. Northampton & England | 20 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Oxford, ENG | 188cm/92kg Tommy Freeman made history during the 2025 Six Nations, becoming the first Englishman to score a try in each round of fixtures — even if the legitimacy of the try awarded against Scotland at Twickenham is justifiably contested north of the border. One of the rising stars of England rugby, Freeman combines powerful running with electric speed and finishing ability — everything you could ask for from a winger, in other words. Overall he has 16 tries from 17 starts for Northampton, and five in nine for England this season. He made his starting debut for England at Lang Park in 2022 under Eddie Jones, perhaps he'll make his Lions debut there too. Connacht & Ireland | 28 caps (12 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Canberra, AUS | 188cm/89kg Mack Hansen suffered an ankle injury that will force him to miss the last few rounds of the United Rugby Championship, which must have meant he feared for his spot on this year's Lions tour, especially given the impressive form of Scotland's Darcy Graham. He needn't have worried, despite professing to being "speechless" for the first time in his life. Despite not having the most prolific of Six Nations tournaments, the Australian-born winger with an Irish mother has been a key member of Andy Farrell's back line for Ireland and was, if not a certainty for selection, a pretty safe bet. Hansen was one of the first players interviewed after the squad was announced, telling the event at the O2 via Zoom that he had just been about to go for a swim on Ireland's west coast. In May. You can take the boy out of Australia … Leinster & Ireland | 40 caps (17 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Nelson, NZ | 188cm/101kg Not many players will have played both against the British and Irish Lions as well as for them, but that's a rare honour that James Lowe will likely achieve this tour. Lowe first played against the Lions in 2017, when he appeared at fullback for the Māori All Blacks in their 32-10 defeat against the Lions in Rotorua. That was the last of Lowe's eight caps for the Māori. Fast forward eight years and Lowe has 40 international appearances for Ireland under his belt and a reputation as one of the most dangerously powerful wingers in the world. Edinburgh & Scotland | 49 caps (32 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps 29yo, George, RSA | 193cm/106kg Nothing short of a try-scoring machine he may be, but Duhan van der Merwe does have his critics, summarised succinctly by Rugby World this week: "Some may argue that Duhan van de Merwe doesn’t offer enough ‘without’ the ball," wrote columnist and author Paul Williams. "But that’s much like criticising a nuclear weapon because all it does is blow things up." It's a fair enough statement. This monstrous winger tore up the record books as a kid in the Western Cape, earning a spot as part of the South Africa squad that finished runners-up at the 2014 Junior World Championship. A move to Montpellier in 2016 didn't really work out, but shifting north to Edinburgh proved the trick, with the club signing him despite question marks over a hip injury. Injury is clouding him in the lead-up to this Lions Tour, an ankle injury requiring surgery has kept him out the Edinburgh line up since March. Leinster & Ireland | 46 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/92kg A Paris 2024 Olympian with the Ireland Sevens team, Hugo Keenan displays all the skills needed to break lines and tackles at will in the 15s game as well. Equally capable at fullback or the wing, Keenan is super capable under the high ball and is very dangerous in broken play — kicking to him is ill-advised. Another of Leinster's bevvy of stars who will line up for the Lions — 12 of the touring squad play in the blue of Leinster. Stade Toulousain & Scotland | 60 caps (146 pts, 16 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Edinburgh, SCO | 193cm/107kg The stand out 15 of the home nations during the past Six Nations, nothing would stop Blair Kinghorn being named in this squad. That's despite him likely to miss at least the first tour match in Perth against the Force due to Toulouse's Top14 finals commitments. The final of the Top14 — of which Toulouse are runaway leaders of at the moment — takes place on the same day as the Lions' first match in Australia, June 28. But given Kinghorn's skill set — barring scrumhalf he can reasonably be expected to slot in anywhere in the back line should the need arise — there was no doubt that the ex-Edinburgh man would make the trip, no matter how delayed he is. The British and Irish Lions will play nine matches in Australia, culminating the three Tests in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney in late July/early August. Prior to their departure, the Lions will face Argentina at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. This will be the third time in recent years that the Lions have faced a national team as part of their pre-tour preparations, following matches against Japan at Murrayfield in 2021 (Lions won 28-10) and against Argentina in Cardiff in 2005 (a 25-25 draw). The Lions have also met France at the Parc des Princes in 1989 (Lions won 29-27), a Rest of the World team at Cardiff Arms Park in 1986 (Lions won 15-7) and the Barbarians at Twickenham in 1977 (Lions won 23-14). There were also unofficial matches against Cardiff and Wales at the old Arms Park in 1951 and 1955 after the tourists had returned. The tour proper though, starts in Perth. ABC Sport will be live blogging every match of the British and Irish Lions Tour, including all three Tests.

Title: Briefly Noted
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/05/briefly-noted-103/
Time Published: 2025-05-09T00:25:08Z
Full Content:
After 35 years with Ariel Investments, effective May 1, 2025, John P. Miller is retiring from his role as portfolio manager for the Ariel Fund. RiverNorth/Oaktree High Income Fund (RNHIX) won the 2025 LSEG Lipper Fund Award for Best General Bond Fund for the five-year period ended November 30, 2024. RiverNorth is a closed-end fund specialist that has collaborated with other “A” managers on several funds. The fund embodies three strategies. RiverNorth manages the Tactical Closed-End Fund Strategy, and Oaktree manages the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies. Oaktree tactically manages the allocation between the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies based on both market opportunities and the risk-reward trade-offs between the two asset classes. The fund has returned 4.2% APR since inception, while the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index clocked in at 1.6%. Lazard US Equity Concentrated Portfolio will undergo a reverse stock split, 1:3, effective May 16, 2025. BlackRock has filed for a new active infrastructure ETF, iShares Active Infrastructure ETF, which will likely launch by the end of June. The ETF, which does not yet list a ticker or fees, is to be managed by Balfie Morrison, who leads the BlackRock Global Listed Infrastructure fund, which is currently only offered in Australia. The Australian fund launched in 2007 and has, since inception, trounced its benchmark (11.5% APR vs 8.75% for a Developed Core Infrastructure 50/50 index). Mr. Morrison became co-manager of that fund in September 2023. Reportedly, the new ETF will be substantially similar to that fund. If so, expect a bit over 50% US and a bit over 50% utilities. BlackRock also offers the passive, five-star $2.2 billion iShares US Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity fund reopened to new investors effective April 1. The fund was soft closed since May 2020, when it hit its target capacity. The decision to reopen the fund is due to significant redemptions in recent years, due to the sentiment of emerging markets and underperformance. Effective May 1, 2025, the expense ratio for Janus Henderson Corporate Bond ETF has dropped to 0.20% for at least 12 months. BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund will be converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF and the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, respectively, on Sept. 12. The expense ratios will be 0.4%, and both funds will retain their current objectives and managers and maintain “substantially similar” strategies. GQG US Equity ETF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund in registration. Under normal circumstances, the ETF will invest in U.S companies. Rajiv Jain, Brian Kersmanc, and Sudarshan Murthy are the portfolio managers; Siddharth Jain is the Deputy Portfolio Manager. Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Reductions and/or Expense Reimbursements will be 0.49%. On or about May 9, 2025, Lazard International Equity Advantage Portfolio will convert to an ETF, the Lazard International Dynamic Equity ETF. On or about November 7, 2025, Morgan Stanley Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund will be rechristened as Morgan Stanley Income Opportunities Fund and relaunched as an active ETF. Pending shareholder approval in June, the Morgan Stanley Mortgage Securities Trust will relaunch as the Eaton Vance Mortgage Opportunities ETF. On June 20, 2025, the OTG Latin America Fund will become the OTG Latin America ETF. On April 3, Vanguard Short Duration Bond ETF, an actively managed exchange-traded fund, launched. It offers diversified exposure to primarily short-duration U.S. investment-grade bonds, including structured products exposure, like asset-backed securities, with the flexibility to invest in below investment-grade debt to seek additional yield. The fund has an expense ratio of 15 bps. Vanguard Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF, Vanguard Total Treasury ETF, and Vanguard Government Securities Active ETF are in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager of the inflation-protected securities and total treasury ETFs. John Madziyire, CFA, Nathan Persons, and Brian W. Quigley, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of the government securities active ETF. The Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF will have total annual expenses of .05%; the Total Treasury ETF will have total annual expenses of .03%; and the Government Securities Active ETF will have total annual expenses of .10%. Virtus IG Public & Private Credit ETF is in registration. David Albrycht, CFA; Zachary Szyndlar, CFA; Ryan Jungk, CFA; George Goudelias; and John Wu, CFA will manage the fund. The plan is to provide diversification by allocating the fund’s investments among various sectors of these markets, including, without limitation: investment grade corporate bonds; mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), including commercial MBS and residential MBS; asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including private credit. Expenses have not been stated. Effective on or about November 21, 2025, the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF becomes the iShares U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness Aware Active ETF. “Readiness Aware.” Your guess is as good as ours. Effective May 2, 2025, the Calamos Alternative Nasdaq® & Bond ETF will become the Calamos Nasdaq® Equity & Income ETF. Carillon Chartwell Small Cap fund will be reorganized into the Chartwell Small Cap Growth fund on or about October 17. The following name changes will take effect on June 2, 2025: My first impulse was: “more babble.” Maybe not. Here’s their explanation. The iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF’s Underlying Index is an optimized index designed to maximize exposure to positive ESG characteristics while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index. In addition to its name change, effective with the rebalance at the end of May 2025, the Index Provider for iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF has updated the index methodology to require that the Underlying Index have a minimum ESG score of at least 20% better than that of the MSCI USA Index … On June 25, 2025, Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund will be (new word for me) “repositioned” as the ESG-lite Janus Henderson International Dividend Fund. At base, they will loosen ESG strictures on the portfolio while not entirely abandoning “consideration” of ESG factors that are “financially material.” The advisor to ONEFUND, an S&P 500 index fund? Effective immediately, the adviser’s name has changed from ONEFUND, LLC to CYBER HORNET ETFS. Presumably from Michael Saylor’s feverish, “Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.” And presumably, they’re staking their future on their second fund, the CYBER HORNET S&P500 Bitcoin 75/25 Strategy ETF. Effective May 1, 2025, Roundhill Small Cap 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF will be renamed Roundhill Russell 2000 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF. The Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund has been renamed the Schwab Prime Advantage Money Fund. All other aspects of the fund remain the same. (Thanks, Don G.!) Effective April 4, 2025, the WisdomTree PutWrite Strategy Fund (PUTW) changed its name (now, the WisdomTree Equity Premium Income Fund), principal investment strategies, and ticker symbol. On June 26, 2025, (a) Chip and I will be in Sweden, and (b) the WisdomTree Japan Hedged SmallCap Equity Fund will become the WisdomTree Japan Opportunities Fund. But wait! There’s more. It’s going to be an index fund with a very distinctive index. Among the new fund’s other quirks are the following allocation bands: 0-45% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that are strategic holdings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that provide a high “total shareholder yield” 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that have a low valuation ratio but favorable earnings and dividend growth characteristics. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of companies that have exposures to thematic opportunities from developments in the geopolitical space, technology trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Within this latter category, 25-50% of the stocks will be companies positioned “to benefit from geopolitical considerations,” 5-25% from central bank movements, and 5-25% from cool new tech. The Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF and Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF were closed and liquidated on April 29, 2025. On April 25, 2025, Foundry Partners Small Cap Value Fund merged with North Square Small Cap Value Fund. On May 9, 2025, the Gotham Enhanced 500 Plus Fund and Gotham Hedged Core Fund merged with and into the Gotham Index Plus Fund. Effective April 11, 2025, the Hartford Schroders Sustainable International Core Fund was liquidated. On April 17, 2025, the Mast Global Battery Recycling & Production ETF was shut down. The Neuberger Berman International Small Cap Fund will experience termination and liquidation on or about May 28, 2025. (sigh. That means it will miss my birthday party again this year.) On April 29, 2025, the Ramirez Government Money Market Fund was liquidated. On May 16, 2025, the Range Global LNG Ecosystem Index ETF will be liquidated. Sprucegrove International Equity Fund was liquidated on May 1, 2025. On or about May 30, 2025, the Tuttle Capital Self Defense Index ETF (not the silliest of the advisor’s offerings, IMHO) will be liquidated, terminated, and otherwise struck defenseless. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: BlackRock-Backed Securitize Raises Strategic Funding From Jump Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/05/08/blackrock-backed-securitize-raises-strategic-funding-from-jump-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T15:30:58Z
Full Content:
ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of Securitize Jump Crypto, the digital asset arm of Chicago quantitative trading firm Jump Trading, has taken a strategic stake in Miami-based Securitize, one of the leading platforms bringing real-world assets (RWAs) like Treasurys and private credit onto public blockchains. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This is the first outside investment in Securitize since BlackRock’s $47 million round last year, which cemented the firm as a cornerstone of the fast-growing tokenization market. Other blue-chip asset managers, including Apollo, Hamilton Lane and KKR, have also tapped Securitize to issue blockchain-based funds. These aren’t fringe crypto experiments. The funds tokenize mainstream products including Treasurys, private credit, and private equity on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the $10 trillion asset manager’s first blockchain-based vehicle, which also is Securitize’s marquee product, has become something of a bellwether of tokenization. Structured as a money market fund, it now manages $2.86 billion in assets. Since its debut just a little over a year ago, tokenized Treasury products have surged 800% to nearly $7 billion, a sign that the pitch is resonating with yield-hungry investors looking for alternatives to traditional wrappers. Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize “We think that the market should be digesting this investment really as a signal that firms like Jump now have conviction in not only tokenization, but the role and the impact that tokenization is having on capital markets, capital formation and investment accessibility on chain,” says Michael Sonneshein, Securitize's COO and former CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale. He argues that tokenization offers distinct advantages that legacy formats don’t match. Products like BUIDL, for instance, pay daily dividends, something traditional money market funds do not, and investors are increasingly choosing tokenized Treasurys over stablecoins as collateral, largely because tokenized products share yield with holders. In addition, pairing tokenized funds with decentralized finance opens new lending opportunities. Jump will help Securitize to do just that: expand the role of tokenized assets in collateral management and trading. The tokenization sector is growing fast. Since BUIDL’s launch, RWAs have more than doubled from about $9 billion in total value locked to $22.4 billion. Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market will balloon to $19 trillion by 2033. On Monday, the SEC's Crypto Task Force will host a roundtable on tokenization with issuers including Securitize. Meanwhile, the company is preparing its next act. In partnership with Lisbon-based Ethena Labs, it is about to launch a new blockchain called Converge. The idea is to create a compliant gateway for institutional capital into DeFi. Converge is expected to launch later this quarter.

Title: US and Russia seek ways to restore gas flows to Europe

Officials from Washington and Moscow held discussions on the U.S. contribution to reviving Russian natural gas sales to Europe, eight sources familiar with the content of the talks told Reuters. Sources close to the bilateral talks said that carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union’s gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although much of Europe has sought alternative supplies, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is in place. As for Russia, nothing has hurt its economy more than the loss of most of the European gas market three years ago. Today Russia supplies 19% of Europe’s demand, up from 40%, consisting mostly of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some of it piped through Turkey via the TurkStream pipeline. Washington’s involvement in restoring gas sales could help Moscow overcome political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington by offering it the ability to see and possibly control to some extent the volumes of Russian gas that return to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said. From 2022, Europe has turned to other gas suppliers, including U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). U.S. envoy Steve Whitcoff and Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, have discussed gas as part of the Ukraine peace talks, two of the eight sources said. Whitkov’s spokesman declined to comment when asked if they had discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. “At present, there are no such discussions,” Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which Dmitriev heads, said in a statement to Reuters. As for how the Americans could get involved, five sources said that in talks so far there has been talk of U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline linking Russia to Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself. U.S. companies could also serve as buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and sending it to Europe, including Germany, the sources said. Two of the sources said diplomatic talks involving potential U.S. investors also considered the idea of a U.S. buyer taking Russian gas and then exporting it to Europe as a way to mitigate European political opposition to resuming supplies. BlackRock, Vanguard and Capital Group each own 1-2% of Gazprom. BlackRock, Vanguard and Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment. Capital Group declined to comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed opposition to a return to Russian energy supplies. “Some people still say we need to turn on the tap of Russian gas and oil again. This would be a mistake of historic proportions and we will never let it happen,” she told a European Parliament meeting on May 7. “Russia has proven, time and again, that it is not a reliable supplier.” Brussels wants to ban new Russian gas deals by the end of 2025 and ban imports under existing deals by the end of 2027. The plan, which will be debated next month, will require the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of member states. Hungary and Slovakia have expressed their opposition to the move. Trump has said he hopes for a peace deal on Ukraine soon and expects this will pave the way for both Russia and Ukraine to do major business with the U.S. Russia is ready to restart gas exports to Europe immediately if there is political will to do so, Putin said. Kiev and Washington signed a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal on April 30 that would include all natural resource assets and infrastructure owned by the Ukrainian government, but did not explicitly mention the pipeline. “If this level of engagement between Russia and the US continues, it is very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows… involving US intermediaries,” a person familiar with the discussions said. Gazprom, keen to revive its European sales, is considering offering German customers short-term 24-month contracts and big discounts on prices, two sources said. It has traditionally asked buyers to sign decades-old contracts, the two sources noted. However, the EU remains broadly opposed and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases pending regarding violations of old contracts.

Thursday, 08 May 2025 FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Leuna-Harze plant, a producer of chemical industry commodities, at the InfraLeuna industrial site, in Leuna, Germany, April 2, 2025. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -With a frost covering Europe's energy relations with Russia, officials from Washington and Moscow have held discussions about the U.S. helping to revive Russian gas sales to the continent, eight sources familiar with the talks have told Reuters. Europe slashed its imports of Russian gas following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a move that saw Russian exporter Gazprom post a $7 billion loss the following year. U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for peace in Ukraine, raising the prospects of a thaw in gas ties. Sources close to the bilateral discussions said carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union's gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Though much of Europe has sought alternative supply, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is agreed.

It now supplies 19% of Europe's demand, down from 40%, mainly consisting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some piped via Turkey along the TurkStream pipeline. Washington's involvement in restoring the gas sales could help Moscow navigate political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington, giving it visibility, and possibly some control, over how much Russian gas returns to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said.

Witkoff's spokesperson declined to comment when asked if he discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. "Currently, there are no such discussions," Russia's Direct Investment Fund, headed by Dmitriev, said in a statement to Reuters. Gazprom would consider selling gas to Europe if a new owner took control of the gas network between Russia and Europe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told French magazine Le Point in April. On the route crossing the Baltic Sea Gazprom controls the two twin pipelines of Nord Stream 1 and 2 backed by European firms which hold stakes. Moscow is ready to trade its gas and knows that some European countries still want to buy it, Peskov said in the Le Point interview. "There is a gas seller, there are potential buyers," Peskov told reporters in April. Countries still buying include Hungary and Slovakia which receive gas through the TurkStream pipeline. Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Spain get LNG from Russia's Novatek under long-term contracts. Regarding how the Americans might get involved, five sources said talks to date have discussed U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself.U.S. firms could also serve as the buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and shipping it to Europe, including to Germany, the sources said.

"If this level of engagement between Russia and the U.S. continues, it's very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows... involving U.S. intermediaries," said a person who is familiar with the discussions. Gazprom, keen to resurrect its European sales, is considering offering German clients short-term 24-month contracts and steep price discounts, two sources said. Traditionally it has asked buyers to sign contracts lasting decades, two sources noted. HURDLES Yet the EU remains broadly opposed, and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases hanging over breaches of legacy contracts. The Nord Stream pipelines were damaged in a sabotage attack in September 2022. Three of the four pipes were ruptured, leaving just one still able to pump gas. The war in Ukraine has also changed the situation, with Russian attacks damaging pipelines crossing Ukraine, though the key transit route remains in working order. A more technical matter is that Nord Stream 2 also never received German government approval to begin sending gas to Germany, a spokesperson from Germany's economy and energy ministry noted, declining to comment further.

Not long ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met me in his office in Brasília and told me that he’d had a disturbing dream. In recent months, Lula had turned seventy-nine and undergone emergency surgery for a brain hemorrhage, and although he seemed fit and healthy when we met, he was in a reflective mood. He’d dreamed the night before about his predecessor José Sarney, who is now ninety-four years old. Sarney is a cherished figure in Brazil: in the nineteen-eighties, he became the country’s first President to take office after two decades of military rule. “In my dream, he came to my house and slept on the floor, and in the morning I made him breakfast,” Lula said. “I woke up worried, wondering if something had happened to him during the night.” The LedeReporting and commentary on what you need to know today. Sarney turned out to be fine, but it is no accident that Lula was concerned about an emblem of democracy. He told me that the entire Western system felt imperilled. “The democracy we learned to live with after World War Two, the functioning of multilateralism as an important role in relations between states, the respect for diversity, the sovereignty of each country is now fading,” he said. “What comes next, we don’t know.” The entire post-Second World War order, created largely through the intervention of the United States, seemed on the verge of collapse. “We thought we were creating a more civilized, more solidarity-based, more humane society,” he said. “The result is worse. It’s as if there is a lamp, and when you open the lid the evil people come out.” Lula has built a career on unwavering leftist principles, but he has also long prided himself on his ability to get along with a variety of leaders. Now, though, he confessed that he was flummoxed by the right-wing populists and anti-globalists gaining power around the world. At the United Nations General Assembly last September, he’d tried to organize a meeting of progressive Presidents. “When we sat down to make the list, I discovered there were no more progressives!” he said. In Latin America, only a small group of left-leaning leaders remains, including Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, Gabriel Boric, of Chile, and Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. “In order to keep the meeting from being too small, I changed ‘progressives’ to ‘democrats,’ so I could invite Biden, Macron, and other people,” Lula explained. “We’ve had two meetings since then, to discuss how to create a narrative to justify the importance of the democratic system as the best thing ever created for humanity’s coexistence—a system with rules, where everyone has rights, and someone’s rights end when they infringe on the rights of others. It’s what worked in the world. Monarchies, empires—they didn’t work. Nazism didn’t work. Stalin’s communism didn’t work.” In his country and in the U.S., he suggested, large portions of the populace seemed to have lost their grip on reality. “There are people who believe things that everyone should understand are lies, because they are so absurd,” he told me. “And my concern is how we are going to build a narrative to destroy this.” The troubling thing, he said, is that “we still don’t have an answer.” Part of the problem was economic, he said. “Democracy starts to fall when it no longer meets the people’s interests. Since 1980, the working people in countries that built welfare states have only lost, while income concentration has increased. So what response can we give to Brazilian society? And to German and American society?” There was also a question of leadership. “The U.S. was the mirror of democracy, the pillar of democracy for the planet,” he said. “Despite being the country that wages the most wars, it’s the country that talks the most about peace, the most about democracy. And yet now there is Trump, who sometimes behaves like—” Lula stopped himself, then continued. “I saw a speech of his in the U.S. Congress recently, and it was absurd—those Republicans clapping at whatever nonsense he said. It was almost the same kind of speech that anarchists used to make in Italy and Brazil at the beginning of the century, calling for a society without institutions, a society where the empire of capital rules.” President Donald Trump made clear his interventionist intentions toward Latin America as soon as he resumed office; in his Inaugural Address, he vowed to “retake” the Panama Canal. Since then, most leaders in the region have handled Washington with elaborate care. The right-wing populists strained to display their loyalty and affinity. Javier Milei—a hard-line libertarian who has slashed away half of Argentina’s government ministries—gave Elon Musk an engraved chainsaw and hailed Trump as “one of the two most relevant politicians on planet Earth.” (The other, of course, being Milei.) He has been rewarded with U.S. support for a twenty-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund loan, and with praise from Trump, who has said that Milei is doing “a fantastic job.” In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele offered to allow the U.S. to deport its undesirable migrants to his country, to be held in an appalling hellhole of a prison. When Bukele recently visited the Oval Office, he and Trump traded smug jokes about their arrangement, with Trump saying that he’d like to send “homegrowns,” too, and Bukele scoffing at the suggestion that he would return the wrongly deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Among the region’s leftist leaders, Colombia’s Petro was the first to resist Trump. After refusing to permit U.S. military planes carrying deportees to land in Colombia, he suggested on social media that Trump was a “white slaveowner,” while comparing himself to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, the doomed hero of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Trump retaliated by announcing punishing tariffs and a sweeping prohibition on U.S. visas for Colombian officials. Within hours, Petro had relented, and his humiliation provided an object lesson for other leaders. In March, a Hong Kong-based company named CK Hutchison Holdings agreed to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium led by the American investment company BlackRock. Trump quickly claimed that he was effectively reasserting control over the canal. Panama’s President, José Raúl Mulino, tried to salvage his dignity with defiant public statements, but he has mostly succumbed to pressure from D.C. Last month, Panama and the U.S. signed an expanded security-coöperation agreement that allows American armed forces to occupy several former military bases along the Canal Zone. In a joint statement on the new security relationship, released during a visit by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a sentence acknowledging U.S. respect for Panama’s sovereignty was pointedly excluded from the English-language version. Panamanians have grown frustrated. An influential friend there wrote to me, “Mulino has not stopped giving his ass to Trump at every turn, in exchange for nothing.” Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum, has made more convincing displays of composure, but she, too, has avoided confrontations with Trump by giving him what he wants. As my colleague Stephania Taladrid detailed recently, these efforts have included stepping up Mexico’s security presence at the border, handing over high-level narco-traffickers to the U.S., and significantly increasing seizures of fentanyl. Even Venezuela’s would-be revolutionary leader, President Nicolás Maduro, congratulated Trump for returning to the White House and agreed to hand over American prisoners from his country’s jails. After the Trump Administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to Bukele’s prison, Maduro issued a statement denouncing the action as “fascism”—but he was careful to address it to Bukele directly, rather than to Trump. Lula and Chile’s Boric have been the most outspoken Latin American leaders. On a recent state visit to India, Boric described Trump’s Inauguration, with Big Tech billionaires “paying fealty to a new wannabe emperor,” as reminiscent of “something from another era.” He criticized the tariffs as “irrational” and “unsustainable.” Although his country’s main export commodity, copper, had so far been exempted, Boric promised to seek out new trade deals with India, Japan, and others. He warned that if Trump did place tariffs on Chile’s copper—eleven per cent of which went to the U.S. last year—the higher cost would ultimately be passed on to American consumers. “The law of the strongest has short legs,” he said. Lula knows that his coalition is thin. In a recent speech, he said, “The Presidents of South American countries should understand that we are very weak if we are isolated.” When I saw him in Brasília, he made a plea for greater international coöperation. “We have to convince the world that it’s not possible to end multilateralism,” he said. “Multilateralism was a form of civility found among states to coexist peacefully, with rules that everyone must follow,” he went on. “It’s already proven that, if we don’t control the air, everyone will be a victim of air pollution. If the sea rises, everyone will be a victim. It hasn’t yet reached the world’s most important leaders that we need global governance to make some decisions globally.” Lula noted that the environment was among the most pressing global issues, but he also acknowledged the limits of multilateralism in dealing with it. This year, Brazil will host the COP30 climate conference, in the city of Belém—a location, at the edge of the Amazon, chosen to bring attention to the crisis of deforestation. Yet it is hard to imagine that it will bring radical change. European countries in particular seem likely to donate less as they scramble to devote more of their budgets to military expenditures. Lula shrugged this off. “I do not believe in money from developed countries,” he said. “They promised a hundred billion dollars in 2009, and they have not yet delivered. It has been sixteen years. Now the need is 1.3 trillion dollars—and they will not deliver.” Lula advocated a world in which the major powers could compete without resorting to warfare, and in which they coöperated more closely on such priorities as hunger and climate change. It was not lost on him that Brazil, as a developing economy, depends on maintaining friendly relations, even when it means partnering with countries with wildly divergent value systems. “We need to say: thank goodness we have China that, from a technological perspective, is very advanced and can compete in the technological world of A.I., giving us an alternative for this debate,” he said. In his telling, Western powers’ animosity toward China was spurred by trade, not by its human-rights abuses or its threats to invade Taiwan. “I am from a generation that learned in the nineteen-eighties, through Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, that the best thing for the world was globalization and free trade. Products should flow freely across the world. Money should flow freely across the world.” China, he said, had merely adopted this theory along with everyone else. “China started producing everything that was produced in the U.S. and Europe. You couldn’t buy a single pair of pants, shoes, or a shirt that didn’t say ‘Made in China.’ They very skillfully copied everything and learned how to produce things as well or better. Now that the Chinese have become competitive, they have become the world’s enemies,” he added testily. “And we don’t accept that. We don’t accept the idea of a second Cold War. We accept the idea that the more similar countries are—technologically and militarily advanced—the more they must talk to each other, because I’m not sure the planet can handle a Third World War.” Lula insists on pacifism in an idealistic way that is unusual among world leaders. “Last year, the world spent $2.4 trillion on weapons, while seven hundred and thirty million people go to sleep every night not knowing if they’ll have breakfast when they wake up,” he said. “That should be humanity’s main concern.” Even after Russia invaded Ukraine, he resisted taking sides. He described a recent meeting with the German Chancellor: “My friend Olaf Scholz came here, sat on that couch, and asked Brazil to sell missiles to him so he could send them to Ukraine. I told him I wouldn’t sell, with all due respect, because I didn’t want any Ukrainian or Russian to die with a Brazilian weapon.” Like some others on the left (and many on the right), he criticized the U.S. and Europe for funding efforts to confront Putin in Ukraine. “When you corner the enemy, you need to have the strength to defeat that enemy, and it’s not easy to defeat Russia,” Lula said. “I discussed this with Biden. And Biden kept saying, ‘We’re going to destroy Putin, and he’ll have to rebuild Ukraine.’ What’s going to happen now? If peace happens, organized by Trump, he will win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Europe will have to pay for NATO, will have to finance the war, and will have to rebuild Ukraine.” A few weeks earlier, Lula had urged Russia to halt the war. “I called Putin and I said, ‘Putin, I think it’s time for you to return to politics. Put an end to this. The world needs politics, not war. You’re missed. There are not enough people to sit around the table and discuss the fate of the planet: What do we want for humanity?’ ” Lula ridiculed Trump’s desire to take over Greenland and Canada. “The only thing left for him to take over is Antarctica,” he said. “Why do Russia and the U.S. want to increase their territories if they can’t even manage what they already have?” In his view, the global posturing by Trump, Vice-President J. D. Vance, and Musk was a serious threat. “They are deniers of the institutions that guarantee democracy worldwide,” he said. “The fact that the U.S. Vice-President interferes in Germany’s politics is already a crime. I have never gone to another country to interfere in an election!” He suggested that the bellicose rhetoric would eventually harm them. “At first, it may look good,” he said. “But the result could be much worse than what they are criticizing. When you release a wild beast, afterward you don’t know how to control it.” Not long before we talked, the U.S. government had announced a twenty-five-per-cent tariff on Brazilian steel. “There will be reciprocity,” Lula said. “But, before there is reciprocity, we want to show the U.S. what two hundred years of diplomatic and commercial relations between Brazil and the U.S. represents.” He pointed out that the U.S. had a seven-billion-dollar trade surplus with Brazil last year, the steel imports included. “What the U.S. imports from Brazil, they transform and then export back to Brazil,” he said. “It’s a two-way street, so I think this will be harmful to the U.S. For our part, we want to negotiate diplomatically. If there’s no possibility, we will take action.” When I asked Lula if Trump had reached out to him, he said no. “If, as a representative of the American state, he wants to talk to Lula, the representative of the Brazilian state, I will talk to him calmly,” he said. “But so far I haven’t had any interest in talking to him, either. If I ever have a problem and need to call him, I will call him.” ♦

Title: BlackRock reveals $32 million Q1 revenue from Bitcoin IBIT ETF in new SEC filing

IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights inflows despite Bitcoin’s 11.15% price drop and evolving custody framework. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It’s been a big quarter for BlackRock’s Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) with new custodians, Bitcoin volatility, a new regulatory landscape, and a pro-Bitcoin president. In its latest quarterly filing, BlackRock reported $47.78 billion in net assets at the end of Q1 2025, a decrease from $51.52 billion in the previous quarter. This decline tracks Bitcoin’s 11.15% price fall during the same period, affirming the ETF’s direct correlation to Bitcoin market performance. While Bitcoin’s price retreat impacted net asset value (NAV), the Trust’s underlying demand remained intact. Share issuances outpaced redemptions by 43 million during the quarter. The total number of outstanding shares reached 1.013 billion, reflecting sustained institutional interest despite market volatility. The NAV per share fell to $47.14 from $53.09. The largest NAV point during Q1 was $60.61 on January 21, with the lowest at $44.62 on March 10. However, as of press time, IBIT is trading at $56 in pre-market as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim $100,000. Operational costs during the quarter were modest relative to asset size. Sponsor fees totaled $33.04 million. BlackRock’s promotional fee waiver for the first $5 billion in AUM at a reduced rate of 0.12% cost the Trust $178,082 during the quarter, though this concession expired in January 2025. Coinbase Custody remained the Trust’s primary Bitcoin custodian. However, BlackRock expanded its custody framework in April 2025, appointing Anchorage Digital Bank under a new custodial services agreement. The move is to add redundancy to safeguard against counterparty and operational risks, especially as Coinbase has faced regulatory challenges. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase was dismissed in February 2025, which removed near-term legal uncertainty around the Trust’s key service provider. Market structure risks also surfaced throughout the filing. BlackRock detailed that Bitcoin sold to fund share redemptions resulted in $624 million in realized gains, evidencing the Trust’s liquidity efficiency. Nevertheless, the document extensively outlined regulatory and security vulnerabilities, including exposure to custody losses, market manipulation, and global regulatory shifts. U.S. initiatives such as President Trump’s March 2025 executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and pending congressional legislation to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over five years were noted as potential market catalysts and risks. The Trust’s custodial and counterparty arrangements are subject to liability limitations. Insurance policies maintained by Coinbase and Anchorage may be insufficient to cover extreme loss scenarios. Lastly, the ETF’s exposure to ongoing regulatory evolution remains central. The filing cited rising scrutiny from U.S. and global authorities, including FinCEN’s proposed rules on digital asset mixers and OFAC’s ongoing enforcement, as factors that could affect liquidity and market access. Ultimately, IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights a balance between robust inflows and market-related NAV compression, while offering an extensive view into how BlackRock manages structural, regulatory, and operational risks in the digital asset landscape.

Title: Bitcoin defies doubts at $98K, so why are investors still cautious?

BTC surges amid hopeful ETF inflows, but the market is still on edge. Despite Bitcoin’s [BTC] impressive hold above the $98K mark, investor sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. This brings along a wave of doubt that feels oddly out of place in a bull market. Is the market caught in disbelief, priming for a euphoric breakout? Or do these signals mirror the 2022 bear market? With BTC’s recent surge reigniting momentum, the current climate may be driven as much by psychology as by fundamentals. Recent data revealed a striking divergence between Bitcoin’s price and prevailing sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) and news platforms. Even with BTC trading confidently above $98K, the 7-day average sentiment remained firmly negative – a pattern historically associated with local bottoms and contrarian buying opportunities. Source: Alphractal This persistent disbelief suggests that the market is psychologically lagging behind price action. While such sentiment drops have previously preceded bullish reversals, it’s worth remembering the cautionary tale of 2022, where extended negativity coincided with a prolonged bear phase. A sharp shift is visible on the ETF flow chart: after weeks of consistent outflows, April ushered in a regime of substantial spot ETF inflows. This renewed institutional interest, primarily led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, appears to have reignited Bitcoin’s upward momentum, pushing it past the $98K mark. Source: Glassnode Unlike the volatile flows of earlier months, this phase shows steady daily net inflows, signaling strong long-term conviction. Institutional confidence may be the key force behind the surge, even as retail sentiment remains cautious. While ETF inflows signal optimism, history reminds investors to stay cautious. In 2022, bullish sentiment, driven by institutional products and macro trends, collapsed due to liquidity shocks and excess leverage. A sudden shift in risk appetite or regulatory pressures could trigger rapid outflows, reversing recent gains. Although ETFs offer transparency, they don’t shield Bitcoin from market volatility. If inflows slow or turn to redemptions, Bitcoin could face sell-offs similar to past cycles.

Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-network-activity-drops-to-bear-market-levels-red-flag-or-buy-signal/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

(ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.
