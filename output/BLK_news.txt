U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hemorrhaged money Thursday, snapping a two-week streak of consistent inflows as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday’s historic flash crash. The 11 funds recorded $536.4 million in net outflows, marking the sharpest single-day capital flight since August 1. Ark $ 21Shares’ ARKB suffered the largest outflow with $275.15 million exiting, while Fidelity’s FBTC posted $132 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale’s converted GBTC product witnessed $45 million flee, according to SoSoValue data. Spot ETFs managed by BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also saw capital exodus. Spot Ethereum ETFs also registered $56.8 million in net outflows on Thursday, ending the positive inflow streak witnessed in the previous two trading days. Grayscale’s ETHE suffered the largest single-day outflow with $69 million exiting on Oct. 16, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $15.8 million flee. The dwindling demand comes as markets continue to nurse losses after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to Beijing’s threat to cut off exports of rare earth minerals, which are vital to U.S. technology manufacturing. The surprise announcement sparked the biggest liquidation event on record, with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. While Bitcoin recovered to around $115,000 earlier this week after Trump seemingly tried to de-escalate the tariff war, tensions continue. Crypto prices extended their corrections today, with BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, plummeting to as low as $103,856 in the past day. Meanwhile, Ethereum blockchain’s native token, Ether, fell 1.9% to $3,829 alongside bigger losses in the altcoin market, according to CoinGecko data.

One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the September earnings season having just begun, starting this week we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings so far. BlackRock Inc (BLK, $182.3 billion) The world’s largest asset manager said its JioBlackRock venture marks a key step in expanding access to local investing and retirement products in India. “The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through JioBlackRock, we’re enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and financial assets.” Brown-Forman Corp (BFB, $13.4 billion) The American spirits-maker sees India as a major long-term growth engine for its flagship Jack Daniel’s brand, driven by premiumisation and rising social acceptance of alcohol. “Since Covid, there’s been a rising social acceptance of beverage alcohol in India, particularly among younger consumers. India is the second-largest whiskey market in the world, growing around 8 per cent annually — a perfect storm for Jack Daniel’s growth.” Firan Technology Group (FTG, C$254.8 billion) The Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firm is setting up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to tap India’s cost advantages and policy support. “We concluded India is a very cost-effective place for manufacturing, with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India policy and strong aerospace spending making it an ideal place to operate.” Pernod Ricard SA (RI, €21.9 billion) The French spirits major reported steady growth in India despite a sharp excise tax hike in Maharashtra that weighed on demand. “While India continues to enjoy strong consumer demand, the 50 per cent increase in excise tax in Maharashtra led to higher prices and a consequential impact on sales, partly offset by strong growth in Royal Stag and international brands like Jameson.” Published on October 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Apple is still the best brand in the world, according to Interbrand's report

The Best Global Brands shows which brands are going up, and which are going down... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Interbrand has released its annual Best Global Brands ranking and there's very little movement at the top. The top five are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Samsung in that order, showing that Apple is still... well.... the Apple of many eyes. Other notable brands that rose up through the ranks include Nvidia, Instagram, YouTube, Uber and Netflix. Nvidia had a particularly huge increase (116 per cent), the biggest in the history of the Best Global Brands. There is also the highest number of new entries of any Best Global Brands report, with Uniqlo, Booking.com, Shopify and Blackrock among the newcomers. The reports methodology includes looking at financial analysis, the role of the brand (the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand as opposed to other factors) and brand strength, which takes into account brand loyalty. And it's no surprise to us that some of these top brands are also in our best logos list. In the automotive sector, Toyota held on to its number 6 position while Mercedes and BMW also made the top 20 (10 and 14, respectively). In success stories, Ferrari has seen 17 per cent growth (in at 54) while on the flipside, Tesla declined 35 per cent to number 25. Jaguar was nowhere to be seen and hasn't ranked on its own since 2018. I imagine its recent rebrand probably hasn't helped matters. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. In terms of media and entertainment brands, it was Instagram that stood out as it surged 27 per cent and entered the top 10 for the first time (at number eight). YouTube also saw huge growth, with an increase of 61 per cent to spot number 13 (explore the brand's history with our YouTube logo history). Elsewhere, Netflix surged 42 per cent, and climbed 10 places to number 28. When you think about brands that people use every day for entertainment, neither of these three are a shock. I'm frankly surprised that Netflix wasn't ranked higher. In the world of luxury, Gucci dropped out of the top 50 altogether (to number 69) while Hermés grew 18 per cent (and made it to spot 21) and Chanel managed to cling on to the top 25 at number 24 despite shrinking 8 per cent. Interbrand suggests this may be due to prices post-Covid, which have discouraged some "aspiring middle-class consumers, creating a headwind for the sector". In the world of retail, it was bad news for IKEA and H&M which shrank 9 and 13 per cent, respectively, but good news for Uniqlo, which stormed into the charts at number 47. It must be all those cross-body bags it sold. Interbrand also outlines its Brands to Watch, which shines a light on brands predicted to enter the top 100 in future years. These include Burberry, Canon, KFC, PlayStation, WhatsApp, Zoom and Starbucks. It feels quite amazing that some of those brands aren't on the list already, but I guess there isn't room for everyone.

Investors are plowing money into a broad swath of assets putting the ETF industry in the driver’s seat of what may be another record year. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion, took a victory lap this week, touting ownership of some of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds in history. "Our digital assets ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically zero to 10 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets," said CEO Larry Fink on the company’s earnings call this week. Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc., which is the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion globally. (Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) The star: iShares Bitcoin ETF — ticker IBIT — is now the largest crypto ETF, which gives investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it directly. Assets topped $100 billion earlier this month but have dipped with Bitcoin’s drop. The largest crypto by market value hit a record $126,272.76 on Oct. 6, 2025, and has since slipped below $110,000. BITCOIN SAFE HAVEN, INVESTOR SAYS Escalating tensions over the past week between the U.S. and China are hurting sentiment for digital assets. This as gold popped to a fresh record high of $4,280.20 an ounce. Another standout, iShares Ethereum ETF -ticker ETHA with assets around $16 billion. AMERICANS FAVOR TRUMP'S $1,000 BABY SAVINGS PLAN "Our flagship offerings in IBIT and ETHA were among the top five inflowing products in the ETP industry," Martin Small, CFO and global head of corporate strategy detailed on the call. Like bitcoin, ethereum has dipped to the $3,800 level from its high of $4,955.23 reached on Aug. 24, 2025. LIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE Still, bitcoin and ethereum have each advanced about 14% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500’s 13% rise as of Friday.

Title: Wall Street's rising stars share how they set boundaries and avoid burnout — even in one of the toughest industries

Pressure is among the few certainties of daily life on Wall Street — and knowing how to manage it is key to success. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street how they set boundaries and maintain routines to stay grounded in an industry where the threat of burnout lurks behind each promotion. All of them are standing out at some of the country's top financial firms at age 35 or younger, and somehow maintaining personal lives and sanity in the process. Since Wall Street has little respect for the evening hours, mornings are precious to many of this year's rising stars, particularly when it comes to exercise. From focusing on family, to cooking, to purposefully feeling bored for a few minutes, here are some of the ways finance's young leaders find — and keep — balance. True to the gym-obsessed stereotype, many of the Wall Streeters said exercising is key to staying grounded, especially in the hours before work. Sweating it out at the gym helps relieve the stress they'll likely face during the day, some told Business Insider. As Lamar Cardinez, a principal at Blue Owl, put it, the gym "helps me feel fully awake quickly and supplies you with the energy needed for a full workday." "I'm a morning person, and I will be the person, unfortunately, who will sacrifice sleep so that I can exercise," Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and a big runner, said. For others, playing sports or spending time outside provides the much-needed physical relief. The up-and-comers opt for everything from golf to tennis to snowboarding to yoga to skiing. And though their interests are diverse, Alex Park, a principal at Thoma Bravo, admitted his typical finance bro tendencies when it comes to health habits. "I'm sure you've heard too many people in finance, especially in Miami, talk about padel," he said, referencing the racquet sport popular with America's wealthy. "But I do very much enjoy that sport as well." Another interest that helps him stay grounded? Wellness and longevity science, which he was sure Business Insider had heard "a fair amount." Colleagues might dominate many of the waking hours during the week, but some of the Wall Streeters told Business Insider that prioritizing family is crucial to excelling in their field. For Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at Blackstone, it's knowing that her family pick up the phone "at any point in time." For GTCR's Natalie Lamberton, it's talking after-work walks with her 6-month-old daughter and decompressing her week with her husband every Friday night. Among those who are parents, some said seeing their kids before and after work gives them the perspective they need to walk into the office and inevitable pressure. "I have my wife and my one and a half year old son, and that's my code of comfort," Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, said. "She and my son give me a lot of anchoring so as to make sure that you can do what you need to do once you're out of the house." Joe Slevin, a managing director in Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory group, often unwinds with his wife and three kids, but finds his friends are a necessary lifeline too. "I would say that a few active text threads with old funny friends is essential." Chakravorty is a "huge foodie," and loves to explore the New York City restaurant scene. The same goes for Benson Kane, a vice president at TPG who said he often explores new spots in the city with his wife. Lamberton said she enjoys cooking with her husband, and Chakravorty said she often cooks with her boyfriend as well. A number of the stars treat logging off as more than shutting their computer, and carve out intentional time to get away from their screens. Blackstone's Knut Kirchoff figured out how important it is to spend at least 30 minutes with a book and away from the glow of his phone during the pandemic, and he still keeps up the habit to help him wind down. Cardinez meditates, Lamberton makes time on her commute to purposefully feel bored, and Jake Woodson, the head of US distressed credit trading at Goldman Sachs, spends time in the Catskills. "When it feels like all that matters in the world is XYZ bond all week, getting into the world and getting into nature and experiencing something different is invaluable and gives you motivation to come back to do it," he said. Beyond reading a physical newspaper in the morning with his coffee, Kirchoff tries to bring some analog habits to the office. He tracks his daily tasks in a paper notebook, crossing them off as they're completed. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Ford CEO Admits Automakers Didn’t Consider Their Customers When Going ‘Full Bore’ Into EVs

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/18/2025 4:10:31 AM PDT by Adder American automakers have long prided themselves on building vehicles that meet the real needs of hardworking families and businesses across the country. Yet, recent revelations from Ford’s leadership paint a different picture when it comes to the rush into electric vehicles. Former Ford CEO Mark Fields openly acknowledged that the industry charged ahead with massive EV investments, overlooking what consumers actually wanted. Fields, who led Ford from 2014 to 2017, pointed out the misstep during a discussion on the rapid buildup of EV production. “Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,” he said. This aggressive push came without enough thought to buyer preferences, leaving companies like Ford and GM facing unexpected market realities. (Excerpt) Read more at thelibertydaily.com ...

Perhaps government’s EV incentives are the reason why. 7 posted on 10/18/2025 4:18:42 AM PDT by Empire_of_Liberty [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Paladin2 The 5 litre modular V8 was a great engine.

All these companies just love government mandates for the means of production. They were drooling at the thought of people being forced to buy their crap. And their major shareholders like Blackrock and Vanguard were all in. Mark never asked. Derp. Ya think? Yes, there’s a market for Leftist Gaia Worshiping virtue signalers in Commiefornia and a few other places....the kind of people who live in cities and don’t have to drive very far and who live in areas where there are plenty of charging stations. That does not describe most of the country. Your market was always going to be severely limited. You were idiots to think the demand was going to be there for really mass production. Anybody with a lick of sense outside of your echo chamber could have told you that. I am not so sure that it is a question of “stupid”, as much as a response to government. Insane fuel efficiency standards and insane amounts of money thrown at EV production give a different result. I could wish that American auto manufacturers were fighting the “Climate Change” fakers in science and at the EPA, but they’re not. Perhaps government’s EV incentives are the reason why. The 5 litre modular V8 was a great engine. I have one 20 years old and it is still running like new. This is what happens when you run your business to please the Democrat politicians, instead of doing what you’re supposed to be good at. Unfortunately, it’s the consumers who will pay the price with higher car costs. Corporate America thought the left had won the future and were all jumping fully onboard with the winning political party, now Corporate America is having to face that they misjudged the American people and turned on them prematurely. Capitalism: Build what people want. Communism: Build what the government wants. Never go commie. All he needs is a sex change and the smart-girl glasses and he could be the chick from Cracker Barrel. Or Bud Light. Or..... They were counting on government EV mandates, subsidies and loan guarantees to continue in perpetuity. It’s that simple. Yes. And they still are. Well, to be fair, EV were forced on automakers by the government. They still are, in some states. Green new scam “Former Ford CEO Mark Fields openly acknowledged that the industry charged ahead with massive EV investments, overlooking what consumers actually wanted.” Providing things that consumers want... “What a concept!” to quote Mike Lindell. The Cracker Barrel chick was in the same boat. Where do they find these clueless people? That's OK, I won't be considering Ford next time I buy new, either. Turnabout is fair play. They were mandated by Obama and Puppet Biden. The USA taxpayer was subsidizing this climate crap boondoggle to the tune of $trillions. Very few consumers want to purchase expensive electric vehicles that require expensive far away charging stations. It was an insane, emotional imbecilic idea from the start. But of course, these are democrats. /spit Ford executives didn’t make a mistake. They sold the Ford brand name out for bribe money from Crime Boss Joey’s handlers. Selling cars is their business. They knew it was a made move but didn’t care as long as they got their money. Stupid is excusable with punishment. Criminal is criminal with strong punishment. “Corporate America thought the left had won the future” Much like John Bolton when he sabotaged Trump on many levels, and disparaged him on every talk show in existence. He was FA-ing, and now is FO-ing.

Title: Ethereum: Assessing how ETH could outperform Bitcoin in Q4

BlackRock and institutional moves put Ethereum in focus. Ethereum is holding a net gain of 7.02% versus BTC’s 4.34% for October, with on-chain stablecoin inflows signaling institutional interest. BlackRock’s recent moves, combined with the ETH/BTC ratio nearing 0.04, suggest strategic rotation rather than a short-term trade. So far in Q4, Ethereum [ETH] has lagged behind Bitcoin [BTC], showing a 6.94% dip. But if we look closely, BTC is only 1.15% ahead, despite its nearly 11% rally in the first week that pushed it to an all-time high of $125k. From a technical perspective, BTC’s net gain for October stood at 4.34%, at press time, while ETH remained at a net gain of 7.02% following its 15% first-week surge. In short, ETH is still holding strong relative to BTC. Notably, this resilience is evident on the weekly chart. BTC has dropped 7.15% with two back-to-back lower-low candles, testing its late-June support at $103k. ETH, on the other hand, is holding onto its August gains. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is on the verge of snapping its first weekly green, bouncing nearly 9% off the recent crash to 0.03, reinforcing the thesis that rotation into ETH could be gaining momentum. On-chain, Ethereum’s stablecoin supply is signaling the same strength. The 7-day stablecoin supply on Ethereum has jumped 2.18%, adding $3.47 billion and pushing the total to a fresh all-time high of $163 billion. Simply put, more dry powder is flowing into the ecosystem. Combine this with Ethereum’s resilience versus BTC, and it raises the question: Is rotation into ETH shaping up to be more strategic than a short-term trade? BlackRock is driving the rotation thesis in action. Arkham data shows the firm moving 300 BTC across its last fifteen transactions, accounting for roughly 4,500 BTC offloaded. At the same time, it accumulated 12,400 ETH from Coinbase Prime. The effects are visible on the chart: Ethereum was up 1.12% intraday, holding the $3,830 support despite ongoing weakness in ETH ETFs, while the ETH/BTC ratio hiked 1.56%, at the time of writing, inching closer to key resistance at 0.37. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) In this setup, the surge in stablecoin liquidity isn’t random. Instead, it points to “targeted” capital flowing into Ethereum, suggesting that institutions are rotating for a longer-term rather than chasing short-term trades, with October’s price action so far reinforcing this strategy. Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is eyeing the 0.04 zone, signaling a potential breakout in favor of Ethereum versus Bitcoin, suggesting that ETH’s monthly lag may be nothing more than a short-term blip.

Tributes have been paid to a Dublin man who was killed following a road traffic incident in the US. John Kirby died in hospital on Wednesday, following an incident involving a truck which happened in Austin, Texas, on Friday 10 of October. Mr Kirby, who was in his 20s, had been in the US on a J1 visa and was living with two friends. Blackrock Rugby Football Club has paid tribute to him, saying he "made a huge impact both on and off the field". In a post on the club's website, Director of Rugby Michael Hearty said that Mr Kirby will be remembered "fondly for his smile, his laughter, and his spirit". "John had that special kind of presence. A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressing room. "Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. "He was the sort of teammate you were always happy to see walk through the door." Mr Hearty also described John as a great worker, adding that "the word 'no' was not in his vocabulary". He extended his condolences to all of his friends and family. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $1.2 Billion in weekly outflows

Time Published: 2025-10-18T10:27:46Z

The United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced a challenging week, with over $1.2 billion in total outflows as Bitcoin prices tumbled. Despite the decline in institutional inflows, Charles Schwab says investor engagement with crypto-related products is rising, reflecting a growing interest among retail and institutional clients in digital assets. Data from SoSoValue shows that the eleven US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded $366.6 million in outflows on Friday, closing out a negative week for both the products and the broader cryptocurrency market. The largest withdrawal came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which lost $268.6 million in a single day. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw substantial redemptions totaling $67.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC experienced $25 million in outflows. A smaller withdrawal was reported from the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF, while the remaining funds saw no activity on Friday. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US witnessed $1.22 billion in outflows over the past week, with only one day—Tuesday—showing minor inflows. The downturn coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from above $115,000 on Monday to just below $104,000 on Friday, marking a four-month low. The steep decline highlights how sensitive institutional products remain to Bitcoin’s price movements, with ETF investors appearing to pull back amid growing market uncertainty. While ETF redemptions signal cooling sentiment among some investors, Charles Schwab remains optimistic about the long-term potential of digital asset investment products. Speaking on CNBC, CEO Rick Wurster revealed that Schwab’s clients now hold 20% of all crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US. He added that interest in crypto has grown substantially over the past year, with visits to the company’s crypto-related webpages up 90%. “Crypto ETPs have been very active,” Wurster said, emphasizing that the topic continues to draw high engagement from investors. ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that Schwab’s large brokerage platform positions it well to capture future demand. The firm already offers crypto ETFs and Bitcoin futures and plans to launch spot crypto trading for clients in 2026, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector even amid short-term volatility. October, historically one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, has so far delivered disappointing results. Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin has gained in ten of the past twelve Octobers, but this year, the asset is down 6% month-to-date. Despite the slump, some market analysts remain hopeful that the trend of “Uptober” could return in the second half of the month. Many point to the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year as a catalyst that could reignite demand for risk assets, including Bitcoin. For now, however, the combination of ETF outflows, price pressure, and macroeconomic uncertainty has weighed heavily on crypto sentiment—leaving investors to watch whether the coming weeks can reverse October’s red start.

Title: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Cardano (ADA) fell roughly 27% this week, slipping below the $0.66 support as risk-off flows hit crypto. Bitcoin’s slide toward $104,000 and softer altcoin liquidity magnified downside, and on-chain data shows large holders leaning defensive. Santiment-tracked wallets holding 1–10 million ADA offloaded about 40 million ADA over seven days, while broader whale distribution reportedly reached 350 million ADA, pressuring price. other big wallets accumulated 140–200 million ADA, creating a split tape that’s fueling choppy consolidation between $0.65–$0.70. Derivatives add to the cautious tone. Cardano’s open interest slipped 2.12% to $669.9 million, and long liquidations ($1.13 million) dwarfed shorts ($187,000), signaling bulls bore the brunt of the latest flush. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is carving a falling wedge, but confirmation requires a breakout above $0.74. Until then, momentum indicators remain mixed: RSI 37 (approaching oversold) while CMF 0.12–0.15 hints at returning spot inflows that have yet to overpower supply from large holders. Technicians flag a “risk-first” path: losing $0.66 puts $0.65 in play; failure there opens $0.62–$0.60, then $0.57 (channel/structure confluence). A deeper shakeout could probe $0.53 if broader crypto weakness persists. On the upside, ADA must reclaim $0.66 and then clear $0.74–$0.80 (50-day EMA cluster) to flip trend strength. Above that range, bulls target $0.86, with a psychological $1.00 retest feasible into Q4 if risk appetite and flows improve. Several analysts still eye a path toward $1.20–$1.60 on a confirmed breakout, but most caution the market may dip before it rips given leverage resets and uneven liquidity. ETF headlines (including the Oct. 23 Grayscale ADA ETF decision window), stablecoin and ETF net flows, and whether whale selling cools. A rotation back into altcoins typically follows BTC stabilization; conversely, renewed BTC downside would likely extend ADA’s consolidation near the lows. Beyond price, Cardano’s community treasury has surpassed 1.6 billion ADA ($1 billion), funded by fees and staking rewards and governed via Project Catalyst, a war chest that supports tooling, DeFi, and infrastructure without VC overhang. New staking access (e.g., eToro U.S.) and ongoing initiatives like Midnight and Leios continue to broaden the roadmap, even as TVL ($288 million) lags larger chains.

Title: Should every midlife woman be on HRT - even with no menopause symptoms?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/10/18/hrt-theres-no-need-for-suffering-any-more-like-our-mothers-and-grandmothers-did/

Suzanne Noonan, a mother of three children, struggled for months with debilitating anxiety, hot flushes and poor sleep but was afraid to look for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as there is a history of breast cancer in her family. A friend, a beautician who had heard clients say HRT had changed their lives for the better, urged her to try it. By the time Noonan (45) went to her GP in Co Limerick a year ago, “my adrenaline was through the roof”. The doctor reassured her about the breast cancer risks and strongly recommended HRT, as the pros outweighed the cons. “So I bit the bullet.” Within two weeks, “I was so mellow and just felt right again in the world.” Now she recommends that any woman troubled by menopausal-related symptoms should go to their GP and “take the leap to HRT – you will not regret it”. The message that women need not suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause is spreading. With increasing evidence of other health benefits from the repletion of waning hormones, even those without troubling menopausal symptoms may wonder if they are missing out by not going on HRT. It doesn’t even cost anything, since the State has made the medication free since June 1st. Could that prove to be another psychological nudge? This week there was news of a study, led by the University of Galway, that indicated a link between HRT after menopause and a lower risk of dementia. Last week, eminent consultant endocrinologist Dr Donal O’Shea talked of “medical consensus” that all women should go on it at the time of menopause, unless there are strong contraindications. “Oestrogen replacement is good for bones, it’s good for heart, it’s good for brain,” O’Shea told Jen Hogan on The Irish Times podcast Conversations with Parents. He said he would be advising his daughters, “if I’m around when they’re post menopausal”, to go on it. While many agreed and welcomed his comments, others had a different view. “I think Donal should stay in his lane,” says Dr Deirdre Lundy, clinical lead of the complex menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital (NMH). While she says he is entitled to express his opinion, “that most certainly is not the medical consensus”. The “actual consensus”, based on international guidelines, according to Lundy, is that there are only two reasons to go on HRT. “One is for symptom control, and in that case there is no protocol for how long to take it or when to stop it. If your symptoms continue to trouble you and you want to stay on it for 20 or 30 years, which, by the way, I’ve done myself, so I’m not an anti-HRT person, then you go right ahead.” The second indication for treatment is bone density. “A primary use of HRT, even for people with no symptoms, would be low bone quality.” In addition to proven benefits for the heart and bones, it is believed there are other positives “but the data is not there yet. That is why the consensus is not to put everybody on HRT and not to stay on it forever”. [ Does femtech suggest so-called women’s troubles might soon be taken as seriously as men’s?Opens in new window ] About 20-30 new people a month are seen at the NMH clinic, one of six public, specialist menopause services around the country. GPs, who do most HRT prescribing, can refer more complex cases to these clinics. The decision whether or not to take HRT is very individualised, says Cork GP Dr Ciara McCarthy, clinical lead for women’s health in the Irish College of General Practitioners. It should only be considered by somebody after discussing with a GP the risks and benefits for them personally. Despite it being acclaimed as good for the heart, “the international guidelines would say that HRT is generally not recommended for asymptomatic women solely for the prevention of cardiovascular disease”. Cardiologist Dr Blaithnead Murtagh of Blackrock Health in Galway also stresses the need for “a holistic, individualised approach to menopausal women, including lifestyle advice, diet modification, as well as discussion on the role of HRT”. If there are no problematic symptoms, she does not recommend HRT for future cardiac health reasons. However, HRT prescribed before the age of 60, or within 10 years of the menopause, “is likely associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality”. Women with early menopause, she adds, should be encouraged to use HRT until the average age of menopause, which is 51 in Ireland, according to the HSE. Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage Periods stopping before the age of 45 is considered early menopause and puts women at a higher risk of not only cardiovascular disease but also bone loss, says McCarthy, which is another reason HRT would be recommended. Older women who have, or are at high risk of developing, osteoporosis could also benefit. During a menopause consultation, other factors that may be relevant to optimising health will be considered, such as vitamin D, calcium, smoking cessation, weight-bearing exercise and healthy diet. Addressing problems with blood pressure and high cholesterol, “will lead to knock-on improvements in long-term cardiovascular risk without taking HRT”. An increased risk of breast cancer, which is the concern women most often raise, is small, she says. The 2002 study by the Women’s Health Initiative, which linked HRT to an elevated risk of breast cancer, as well as blood clots and stroke, is now regarded as flawed, although the fear it generated still lingers. “Family history of breast cancer does not preclude the majority of women from using HRT,” says McCarthy. “But what your family history influences is your baseline risk of developing breast cancer.” The average woman, without a strong family history, has a 23 in 1,000 baseline risk of developing breast cancer in their 50s. This increases to 27 in 1,000 within five years of being on combined HRT, ie oestrogen and progestogen. However, among those on oestrogen-only medication, breast cancer incidence actually drops, to 19 per 1,000 women aged 50-59. (Most women are prescribed a combined form because progestogen is needed to protect against womb cancer.) The risk of breast cancer increases the longer HRT is used. The decision to start, or continue, is generally down to a person’s perception of acceptable risks, adds McCarthy. I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer There is both “toxic negativity” and “toxic positivity” towards HRT, and it is about finding a balance, says GP Dr Brian Kennedy, clinical lead at the midwest complex menopause clinic in Nenagh, Co Tipperary. “I wouldn’t agree that everybody needs HRT, but I do think everybody needs a conversation about HRT. Everybody needs to be aware of the risks and benefits and make their own decision,” he says. [ Relationships and ... menopause: ‘Small gestures of love can go a long way during this time of change’Opens in new window ] He thinks for about 20 per cent of women, menopause “is like a horrific illness – a mixture of physical, psychiatric and social unwellness that is so disabling”. It is obvious they need HRT. Another 20 per cent are probably okay without it – and there’s everybody in between. Hot flushes, insomnia and night sweats are widely recognised symptoms, but more subtle signs, such as brain fog, weight gain and stiff, sore joints, tend to be underplayed. Kennedy points out to patients that perimenopause and menopause do not happen in a vacuum. It is generally a very vulnerable time in women’s lives. They may be caring for teenagers or children, as well as ageing parents, and being pulled in all directions, while approaching the end of their fertility. “HRT is not going to solve everything, but it is definitely much more of a help than a hindrance in the vast majority of cases,” Kennedy says. There will always be women averse to pharmaceutical remedies for what is a natural transition in life. Indeed, the misconception of the menopause “as always being a medical issue which consistently heralds a decline in physical and mental health should be challenged”, argues Prof Martha Hickey of the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, in the Lancet medical journal. “Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage and reduce fear and trepidation among those who have yet to experience it.” Prof Rose Anne Kenny, head of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and founder of the Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing (Tilda), agrees “100 per cent” with O’Shea’s sentiments. “I feel very strongly that as medics we should be taking a much more holistic approach to HRT for women.” The protection it offers for bone density, for example, is important because fractures are a big reason for older people’s health going downhill. “The earlier you get in, the better – once your hormones have attenuated and you’re menopausal,” Kenny says. While it is primarily of value for menopausal symptoms, broader benefits include lubrication of mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth, eyes and vagina. “These aren’t related to diseases as such, but they’re very much related to quality of life for women.” Vaginal dryness can be classed as a menopausal symptom, she says. “Everybody gets that post menopause.” According to the Department of Health, the State will meet the cost of HRT where it has been prescribed “for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with all stages of menopause”. Budget 2025 allocated €20 million for this scheme and, as the pharmacy dispensing fee is now also covered, this was increased to €24 million for 2026. “It’s fabulous now I don’t have to pay for it,” says Suzanne Noonan, who feels she never wants to come off HRT. “I see it as just replenishing the hormones that my body no longer produces. There’s no need for suffering any more like our mothers and our grandmothers did.” “I went through perimenopause and menopause not knowing,” says Tracey Latham, now aged 45. She initially put excessive sweating down to unhealthy lifestyle choices, but was also very angry and irritable. “I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer – if only I was on them sooner, life would have been much better.” [ Perimenopausal and menopausal skin: How to tackle the most common problemsOpens in new window ] However, Anne from Co Wicklow says: “Personally, I started HRT and immediately felt much worse. I stopped it and felt better.” Jaimie (48) says she often raised the question of menopause with a GP after her periods stopped before she was 40. Instead she was prescribed anti-depressants. She ordered a kit online that told her she was in the menopause. “When your doctor won’t even acknowledge your symptoms, how can you proceed? I’ve tried to change GPs but there are so few in my area. It’s cruel.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Old Irish dressers, settle beds and dug-out chairs in a vernacular sale

Cavan auctioneer Victor Mee has built up a strong reputation for selling offbeat stuff, such as advertising memorabilia, antique garden furniture and vintage agricultural machinery. His next sale, live online from 3pm on Sunday, October 19th, will be filled with vernacular furniture, kitchen implements and even a few old metal tractor seats. Vernacular furniture – also known as country furniture – refers to the everyday furniture used in rural homes in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Ireland, pine tables, dressers, wooden chairs, dowry chests and wardrobes – mostly made of pine – are the main pieces of vernacular furniture for sale in auctions. Mee fell in love with it a long time ago. “I bought my first hedge chair in the 1970s for 50 pence and I’ve been enamoured ever since,” he says. “These pieces of furniture were born out of need and the pieces that survive today are like genuine historical artefacts.” Dressers remain popular for their original function – displaying the best crockery in the house – most of which was, and still is, only used for special occasions. There are a few dressers at the Mee auction, the best of which is a 19th-century painted pine dresser from Co Clare (€500-€800). It has three open shelves over a rows of short drawers and two lower cupboards with panelled doors. The pine settle bed was another staple of vernacular furniture. Usually positioned close to the hearth, this high-backed seat provided storage and seating during the day but could be converted to a bed at night-time. The Mee auction includes an early 19th-century pine settle bed from Cork, covered in old flaky paint (€800-€1,200) and another stripped pine settle bed (€250-€450). The 19th-century Irish pine dug-out chair is perhaps one of the more unusual lots (€1,000-€2,000). Dug-out chairs were exactly what you might think – a chair carved from a single trunk with the interior “dug out” for sitting on. It is crude and weathered looking, and Mee suggests it “speaks loudly of a forgotten era”. Shop fittings – in particular sets of drawers – have become sought after by homeowners drawn to eclectic interior styles. There are a few sets of shop drawers in various sizes but the most noteworthy are two sets of 56 drawers in pine from the 1940s (€1,000-€2,000 each). Auctions are also great places for picking up inexpensive crockery, and the Victor Mee auction has plenty of spongeware plates, platters, mugs and bowls from the 19th and 20th century. The set of six 19th-century spongeware soup bowls (€200-€400) are a good example of the style. As a way of creating a pattern on pottery, spongeware was first developed in the 18th century, becoming popular in Britain, Ireland and the United States in the 19th and 20th century. The patterns are created by pressing shaped sponges dipped in coloured pigment into the earthenware clay plate, bowl, jug or mug. This was a thriving cottage industry in the 19th century, and the pieces were often decorated at home by women before being glazed and refired in factories. Smudges, drips and variations in pattern added to the character, creating unique pieces. Contemporary potters such as Nicholas Mosse from Co Kilkenny were instrumental in reviving interest in spongeware techniques and designs. Three books written and signed by Ireland’s first president, Douglas Hyde, are among the lots for sale at Usher’s auction on Monday, October 20th from 6pm. The first edition books – Songs of St Columcille, The Children of Lir and The Children of Tuireann (€400-€700) – were published in the 1940s and are favourites among collectors. Hyde, who founded the Gaelic League, was a distinguished Gaelic scholar and author of many works, including A Literary History of Ireland. He was president from 1938 to 1945. Most of the wide variety of books at Usher’s auction, on view Saturday and Sunday, October 18th and 19th, noon-5pm, belonged to the late Gearóid Mac Gabhann (Gerry Smith). The son of Cavan footballer Big Jim Smith, Mac Gabhann was the founding member of Kilmacud Crokes club in Dublin. He played club football and later was mentor, coach and manager of football, hurling and camogie teams at Kilmacud Crokes. He was an accountant who worked as secretary manager for St Vincent’s hospital, Elm Park and later the Mater hospital. He was fluent in Irish and had a deep passion for Irish folklore, nature, political and local history, as this book collection testifies. The auction also includes manuscripts of religions from around the world, intriguing books on textiles and crafts. Many lots don’t have any estimates – leaving bidding completely open to interested parties. As befitting of a passionate supporter of the GAA, Mac Gabhann’s collection also includes early GAA programmes, medals and other ephemera, many of which are signed. John Weldon’s jewellery, watches and gold coin auction on Tuesday, October 21st, at 2pm, includes a lifetime’s collection of 48 pieces of Irish silver. These include a William IV Chinoiserie silver tea caddy made in Dublin in 1834 by James Fray (€1,000-€2,000), and an Irish silver crested two-handled cup by Robert Calderwood, made in the mid 18th century (€1,200-€1,800). victormeeauctions.ie; usherauction.ie; jwa.ie Estimate €1,200-€1,800 Hammer price €1,200 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €1,400-€1,800 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €200 – €300 Hammer price €640 Auction house Adams Blackrock Hammer price €1,600 Auction house Adams Blackrock © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

ByNaveen Rao, Contributor. In their second annual Brain-Computer Interface Symposium, Mount Sinai Biodesign entreated attendees to an inside track on the top priorities and polarities defining BCI’s incomparable rise around the world. The world’s leading companies, neurosurgeons, clinical researchers, investors, advocates, and other leaders past, present and future convened for two days at the New York Academy of Medicine. After last year’s inaugural gathering, this installment drew a full house of 440 attendees and over 50 speakers. The streamlined program offered expert panels, heated debates, heartwarming stories, and a forum bustling with the intangible promises of discovery. Protocol Labs anchored this year’s sponsorship, signaling accelerating private interests in supporting neural research platforms, alongside Precision Neuroscience, Synchron and other companies. BCI defies easy alignment, categorization, or containment, representing a shared challenge and opportunity. For a fecund field tasked with defining, refining, regulating and selling itself while accelerating in every direction in real-time, growing pains are inevitable. The sessions included extensive presentations and discussions on technical advances and clinical methods, but the highlighted themes below are filtered through my lens of bringing this technology to people safely, sustainably, and responsibly, for all parties involved. This chicken-egg neurotech question knows no better stoa than this event, which kicked off with a lightning panel of eight leading BCI neurosurgeons. Their nuanced and wide ranging conversation underscored that progress depends upon and demands a healthy tension between today’s products and tomorrow’s science. Or, was it today’s science and tomorrow’s products? Invasiveness should not remain a limiting issue in BCI development, argued Michael Lawton, who leads Neuralink implantations as President and CEO of Barrow Neurological Institute. Lawton pointed to minimal scarring and chronic inflammation in both animal and human recipients of Neuralink’s n1 implant, arguing that the field should be aiming for “whole-brain BCI” as the goal, to read more data and develop more sophisticated applications. Today, this goal represents a collective effort with many hands on deck. Paradromics shared updates of their benchmarking work to gauge information transfer in neural recording with their Connexus BCI. Blackrock’s long-awaited neural lace is still in development. Emerging companies like Axoft, Neurobionics and Neurosoft are advancing next-generation arrays. In a later session, Ashwini Sharan, Medtronic’s chief medical officer of neuromodulation defended the medtech giant’s “right to compete” in the BCI space with adaptive DBS platform, cleared earlier this year, whose real-time read/write capabilities offer emerging evidence of the practical and clinical benefits of invasive tools, albeit for a narrow band of eligible patients. As for minimalist BCI, the question of electing brain surgery looms large. Elad Levy, from the University at Buffalo, offered a pragmatic view of helping as many people today with the safest technology available in market. He likened today’s BCI to the Wright brothers airplanes, guaranteed to evolve in the next five years and beyond. Levy, who led the IDE study for Synchron’s minimally invasive Stentrode device, has devoted his career to advancing less invasive, less expensive, more accessible approaches to next-generation stroke treatment. New neuroimaging tools are enabling the shift. As BCI propagate into neurosurgical suites around the world, precise brain mapping is emerging as a central need, pointed out Matthew Wilsey, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan who recently implanted Paradromics’ first human user. Levy outlined his use of Neuronetics’ Trakstar platform along with Medtronic tools, which have helped move implantation towards a faster, more affordable outpatient setting without compromising safety or quality. Ian Cajigas from the University of Pennsylvania has led implants of Precision’s Layer 7 array. He reviewed how the limits of fMRI and MEG are opening the door for more advanced “connectomics” to create “wiring diagrams” to guide neurosurgery. In a later session, Michael Ivan from the University of Miami shared how he has used Omniscient’s mapping tools to optimize placement and performance of Neuralink’s device as part of their ongoing clinical trial. Chad Bouton of Northwell Health and founder of Neuvotion stole the show by revealing a “mind body connection” wherein Keith, a man living with a spinal cord injury whose double neural bypass was featured at this event last year, controlled a forearm device worn by Kathy, whose stroke left her partially paralyzed. Bouton explained, “When she holds something, he's literally helping her close his hand, because she's also living with paralysis. And he can now feel what she's holding.” In a video shared with attendees, Kathy sipped her diet coke, aided through over-the-skin wearables controlled by Keith’s thoughts. “It feels like you’re getting back a little bit of what was taken from you,” she told the audience, next to Keith. Neuvotion’s FDA-cleared sleeve is the first of a planned “neurorecovery ecosystem” of off-the shelf, BCI-compatible devices that defy easy value propositions in the best possible ways. In a later session, Chris Kellner from Mount Sinai charted the rapid advances in stroke rehabilitation over the years, from breakthroughs in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) systems, EEG-based wearable BCI, and both old and new attempts with cortical implants. Stroke impacts 800,000 new people each year, widening the berth of chronic patients who can benefit from specialized care. Kellner’s work shows that even patients with several years “between stroke and rehabilitation can still have a robust improvement” using standard scales of functional assessment. Quantifying clinical benefits of BCI, whether in stroke, ALS, spinal cord injury, or other areas, remains the central challenge for commercial companies approaching regulatory clearance and reimbursement decisions. Jamie Brannigan from Mount Sinai encouraged conservative market estimates and tight clinical definitions for suitable BCI recipients. Omid Forouzan, VP of clinical affairs at Synchron, was among several leaders who highlighted the progress and pitfalls of advancing objective measures of digital autonomy, contextual functional independence, activities of daily living considered critical or “instrumental,” and other ways to measure value to end-users. Mariska Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center translated these tactical quality of life measures (feels, functions, survives) into the overarching concept of relational personhood, which gauges how people are, and feel, perceived as full persons by each other. Perhaps Congress needs a bit of the Dutch touch. In the first hour of the event, Lawton shared a video showing Brad Smith, one of Neuralink’s trial participants, playing games with his children through his BCI. In the next session, when Ian Burkhart, founder of the BCI Pioneers Coalition, asked ALS Caregiver and patient advocate MA Fernandez about how BCI could help her family, she answered “I really want Jules to be able to play videogames with Skyler,” referring to her husband and eight-year old son. Indeed. Former CMS Medical Officer Lee A. Fleischer opened the very next panel by saying “it’s very clear that video games don’t fit the reasonable, necessary criteria" after explaining that “CMS cannot pay for things unless Congress says so.” Fleischer pointed to past approvals for speech generation and exoskeleton devices, encouraging innovators to “understand the process and work within the structures because if not, you don’t win.” But when he said the agency’s job is to consider only the benefit and not the cost of new technologies, his panelists pushed back. Mijail Serruya from Thomas Jefferson University called out “quite a bit of hypocrisy in what is paid for” by CMS, cautioning that one-size fits all reimbursement in BCI “could be a trap” because people with identical impairments often have different functionality. David Putrino from Mount Sinai argued passionately that at the bedside, his job was to help drowning people, only for insurers to deny coverage by countering “people are not drowning, their legs just aren’t working. Send us more documentation on the legs.” “We’re in a new age,” Putrino declared. “Technology is advancing faster than ever before, and if we need to use the same system of checks and balances to get treatments through, it will die on the vine before it can help people. My very big fear about BCI is that if it flops now, it’s going to be 20 years before there’s any investor confidence to move forward.” Later that afternoon I moderated a panel with four neurotech investors to discuss market trends, commercial strategies, funding growth and evolution, categories versus platforms, globalization, and founder/funder dynamics. My panelists included Sean Escola, Head of Neurotech and NeuroAI at Protocol Labs, Peter Zhegin, Neurotech Director at e184, Adam Caplan, Founder at Jumpspace Ventures, and Konstantinos Alataris, BOD at Precision Neuroscience, Director at Forepont, and former founder and CEO of Nevro. This year’s funding for implanted BCI will double or triple last year’s $500+ million, driven by Neuralink’s recent $625 Series E. But beyond growth, the key investment trend to watch is the diversification of capital, traditional VC, strategic philanthropies, cryptocurrency firms, international government programs, and beyond. Zhegin observed this is not a purely market-driven trend, but one stemming from investor interest and personality factors. Escola described braiding grant dollars and venture dollars to optimize support across pre-commercial development. Alataris wants to see BCI strategy diverge from traditional med tech commercialization. His remarks followed a series of case studies he’d presented earlier to illustrate the lag between FDA approval and CMS reimbursement for both profitable and failed companies. This so-called valley of death hinders innovation and limits exit options for startups: “You spend 10 years getting to FDA approval, a minimum of $100 to 150 million, then you need to raise another $300 million to create your sales force, and you live and die based on this revenue.” All speakers advised founders navigating this landscape to understand their company’s value fully, and take time to explore all dimensions of the strategic value conferred by different types of backers on clinical and operational goals, from hiring to raising the next round. In a later question about Founder X-factors in BCI, they mentioned the ability to secure both grant and venture dollars, quickly launch a research lab, along with requisite technical expertise and capabilities across the founding team. Alataris called on founders to opt for strategic capital and partnerships in big tech over med tech, while exploring profitable paths to sharing technology, revenue, IP, and maybe even data, with an eye on building for multiple applications. In discussing BCI platforms, he compared the potential to smartphones, Zhegin envisioned developer ecosystems like those at Intel or NVIDIA, while Caplan named read and write capabilities demonstrating sustained safety and performance. Escola called for more modular infrastructure across the ecosystem, so that each BCI company won’t have to absorb millions in equipment costs, and can focus more on business innovation. Building economies of scale in BCI will require vision, intention, and action. Science Corp’s Founder and CEO Max Hodak returned to this year’s event to share a heady list of updates that spanned bringing their retinal prosthesis closer to market, inventing synthetic proteins to enable optogenetic biohybrid arrays, and launching a new, next-generation technology stack to “rewrite the economics of BCI development.” Science’s enablement toolkit includes neural probes, next-generation headstage devices, and a full back end of software applications. Hodak said this modular approach “cuts the total development costs of bringing BCI therapy to market from over fifty to less than five million dollars." Coming from a single company, these developments demonstrate the platform approach discussed earlier. Similarly motivated offerings to scale innovation through interdependence are underway from Mint Neuro and Neuvotion, while new tools like Omniscient’s platform could also smooth the path for BCI startups. While these market innovations represent potential boons for a higher throughput R&D flywheel in the near-term, the longer term impacts on commercial BCI companies’ costs, value proposition (and value perception), and pricing strategies remain open questions. From the outside, a successful BCI ecosystem requires external leadership and vision, too. Beyond attracting diverse pools of capital as described above, neurotechnology’s momentum has drawn interest from public leaders outside the US federal government. Viq Pervaaz, the Senior Vice President of Life Sciences & Healthcare at NYCEDC, shared a macro-economic lens on skilled job creation, catalyzing company formation, leveraging healthcare and life sciences anchors, socioeconomic impact, and more. NYEDC’s ongoing partnership with Mount Sinai has also supported development of new cutting-edge treatments, entrepreneurship and spinouts, and deeper synergies in development. At a time of political gridlock and federal clawbacks across health, science, and global leadership, NYEDC and Mount Sinai’s system-driven collaboration offers a relevant playbook for leaders seeking to future-proof their economies. To build an application layer, BCI needs an application taxonomy, a mindset shift that has already brought the field to a crossroads. Bloomberg reporter Ike Swetlitz opened his panel of seven BCI executives and neurosurgeons by asking for perceptions about Neuralink’s claimed goals to implant “otherwise healthy people” in five years. Several panelists including Tom Oxley, Founder and CEO of Synchron hedged their answers with disclaimers about Musk’s exuberance and the collective need to prioritize safety over rabbitholes. To be fair, Synchron’s sedulous leadership in advancing metrics and standards could arguably benefit this field even more than their high-profile partnerships with Apple and NVIDIA. And yet, the blitz of progress in the last year alone is publicly documented and undeniable: BCI is coming. Neuralink has gone from zero to 12 patients with permanent implants in the US and Canada in under two years. Precision has secured an FDA clearance, and in the time it took to publish findings from their first five patients, increased users by more than tenfold to 50+ people. In a notable breakthrough, Precision’s cofounder and chief science officer Ben Rapoport shared that this now includes patients without disabilities, such as a woman being treated for tumor removal who opted into the temporary implant to help advance research. “Building functional maps from healthy individuals could yield detailed maps of hand, speech and sensory representations,” said Rapoport, adding that such maps could also inform BCI implant targeting. Beyond the lane of motor neuroprostheses, some panelists pushed back on the definition of “healthy people,” pointing to differences between everyone, as well as market shifts towards a broader audiences and elective same-day procedures. Paradromics’ founder and CEO Matt Angle spoke openly about his dual vision for their as a “precisely defined medical device,” as well as a platform technology to turn capital-intensive R&D into “applications that unlock a broader future.” Jacob Robinson, founder and CEO of Motif Neurotech and author of the appli spoke of the BCI field’s shared goal to “create technology that is more normalized, with capabilities designed to bring us to the present.”` His comments, underscored by Helen Mayberg later in the program, stressed that psychiatry suffers from need for more quantifiable, objective assessments. “It’s important to understand what’s happening in the circuit that drives your patient’s suffering. We’re not used to seeing dramatic, fast changes, in people who have failed to respond to years of medication.” Mayberg, a neurologist and director at Mount Sinai, pointed to 20 years of promising evidence of DBS’s efficacy in treating people living with severe depression. She urged the importance of closing clinical gaps with neurotechnology, starting with the lack of validated “facial or behavioral measures, or better, a measure from the brain, that tells us if they’re on the right track or need an adjustment.” Mayburg’s closing observation was that “these patients don’t know who they used to be. We’re having to chase the disorder by defining the disorder.” It reminded me of Alan Watt’s line, which applies to people as well as the BCI field as a whole: “Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.” Teeth gnashing about slow diagnostic innovation aside, BCI is evolving towards broader applications that can fit under the category of “human problems.” Ignacio Saez from Mount Sinai stressed that unlike motor BCI development, for cognitive and psychiatric BCI, "scientific knowledge, and our understanding of the neurobiological basis of cognitive and psychiatric processes, is still a major limiting factor." Unrelated to implanted BCI, Meta shared in a separate session that their newly launched EMG wristband took 6,000 training sessions for off the shelf-functionality, suggesting that we are in the early innings of this next frontier. Michael Ivan, Neuralink’s PI at the University of Miami, said our modern understanding of the brain “is that multiple areas work together to create something powerful. Together, they shape executive function, attention span, memory. As a neurosurgeon, I try to avoid these areas. But with BCI it’s the opposite – we’re trying to find these functional areas to figure out how to sense from them and stimulate them." With their second event, Mount Sinai’s BCI Symposium has cemented itself as a must-attend for those interested in the nexus of brain health and implanted technologies. With an eye on returning to New York in 2026, I will hope for more interdisciplinary and diversified panels, representation from newer companies in BCI and beyond, and tracking all of the inevitable developments between now and then, here are some closing thoughts. Lastly, I asked MA Fernandez if I could share the message her husband Jules shared with attendees. As a young father to an 8 year old son, his ALS symptoms began 6 years ago, and have progressed to the point of his being confined to a wheelchair, dependent on a feeding tube and a breathing tube. Their story broke my heart but gave me hope. How much longer will it take before we can turn to BCI to help folks like Jules?

By Amanda Bartolotta October 17, 2025 For years, India has marketed itself as the world’s next great innovation hub, the emerging Silicon Valley of the East. Politicians, business leaders and industry groups have celebrated the nation’s engineers as global talent, proudly pointing to every Indian-origin CEO leading a major American tech firm as proof of India’s global prominence. The narrative being pushed has been that India was no longer just the world’s back office – it was the future of technology. Yet beneath the glossy slogans of “Digital India” and “Make in India,” reality dictates a very different story. The promise of innovation has rarely matched the results. As noted in a report by The Wire, India’s allure for investors stems not from its depth of talent, but from the fact that its “labor is cheap and laws are lax.” Still, American venture capitalists, eager to stake a claim in the “next tech frontier,” have bought into the illusion. Capital flowed, partnerships multiplied and billion-dollar valuations were built, not on genuine technological breakthroughs, but on carefully crafted narratives that sold success.

Why India copies well but fails to lead in innovation When “multinational educational technology company” BYJU’s emerged, it quickly became the perfect poster child for India’s startup dream. It was marketed as a unicorn – that is, a privately held startup company with a valuation of over $1 billion – proof that India could not only serve Silicon Valley, but become it. The company promised to transform how children learn and to usher in a new age of digital education. Yet, true to the national pattern, the promise unraveled quickly. From unicorn to black sheep Before its eventual financial and legal collapse, BYJU’s stood as one of India’s most celebrated startup success stories. Founded in 2011 and officially being dubbed a unicorn by 2018, it grew from a small tutoring operation into India’s most valued startup by 2022, ultimately being valued at $22 billion. Its learning app soon became a household name across India and founder Byju Raveendran earned a spot on the Forbes list of India’s richest people, celebrated as a self-made visionary transforming education. Former employees recalled his taste for five-star hotels and luxury cars, while his wife and co-founder, Divya Gokulnath, was seen networking in elite tech circles and Silicon Valley gatherings. Together, they emerged as global power players, symbols of a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs reshaping the country’s image on the world stage. At its peak, BYJU’s went on a buying spree, acquiring 19 companies for more than $2.6 billion. The goal was to expand its main products and strengthen its presence in the United States. The company added new areas such as coding, job training and lifelong learning to its offerings and even pushed into the Middle East by becoming the official sponsor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. BYJU’s also hinted at plans to go public within a year, through an initial public offering (IPO) either in India or the United States. Both options were said to be under review, with no immediate deadline. Industry reports also suggested a possible merger with a U.S. special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that could have valued the business at around $40 billion, though co-founder Divya Gokulnath declined to comment. Yet, beneath the optimism, warning signs were already visible. Despite being valued at $22 billion in September 2022, BYJU’s parent company, Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd., reported a staggering $554.77 million loss for fiscal 2021, largely attributed to soaring marketing and employee expenses, leading to layoffs and cost-saving measures to push towards achieving profitability. The company’s rapid rise had been built on hype and expansion, but the financial foundation was already starting to crack. A fall from grace In December 2022, when India’s child-rights commission called out BYJU’s over complaints of overly aggressive sales targeting families and first-generation learners. In the months that followed, scrutiny widened to its coding unit, WhiteHat Jr, amid allegations regarding advertising claims and hard-sell tactics. WhiteHat Jr filed defamation suits against critics, but then withdrew the cases after public backlash. In April 2023, India’s Enforcement Directorate raided BYJU’s offices and later issued a $1.12 billion show-cause notice under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The agency reported uncovering “incriminating” documents and digital evidence during the raid, citing serious financial violations, including missing regulatory filings, delayed export payments and unreported foreign direct investment transfers totaling about $3.37 billion between 2011 and 2023. Investigators also found that the company had transferred about $1.18 billion to multiple foreign jurisdictions during the same period, allegedly under the guise of overseas direct investment. Despite being issued multiple summonses, founder Byju Raveendran repeatedly failed to appear before authorities, remaining evasive throughout the investigation. The troubles didn’t stop there. The startup, backed by major investors including Prosus, Peak XV, Sofina, BlackRock, UBS and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, missed its revenue target for the financial year ending March 2023, according to financial statements released months behind schedule. Soon after, the company’s chief financial officer, Ajay Goel, resigned to return to Vedanta, marking yet another senior exit following the abrupt departures of auditor Deloitte and three key board members in June. The turmoil deepened when Prosus, one of BYJU’s earliest and largest investors, holding over 9% of the company, publicly criticized the firm in July for failing to evolve and for repeatedly ignoring investor guidance. These cascading resignations and public rebukes signaled that BYJU’s once-glowing image had fully unraveled and its troubles were only beginning. BYJU’s has raised a total of $4.45 billion over 27 funding rounds: 2 Early-Stage, 22 Late-Stage and 3 Debt rounds. BYJU’s’ largest funding round so far was a conventional debt round for $1.2 billion in November 2021. BYJU’s had a total of 132 investors, 105 being institutional investors and 27 Angel investors. From loan disputes to courtroom battles Through 2023 and into early 2024, BYJU’s mounting troubles spilled into the courts as disputes over a $1.2 billion U.S. term loan escalated. Court filings and investigative reports revealed that about $533 million had been routed through BYJU’s U.S. subsidiary, Alpha, into accounts tied to Camshaft Capital Management, a fund linked to a 23-year-old portfolio manager whose Miami business address once corresponded to an International House of Pancakes. The findings painted a picture of questionable transfers and lax oversight surrounding the billion-dollar loan. The financial strain only deepened. On July 16, 2024, the Board of Control for Cricket in India filed an insolvency case against BYJU’s over roughly $19 million in unpaid sponsorship dues. By the end of the year, both Deloitte and BDO had resigned as auditors, while major investors, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Prosus and Peak XV (Sequoia India) quit the board entirely. India’s Byju’s can’t pay employees At the same time, Qatar Holding petitioned the Karnataka High Court to enforce a $235 million arbitral award against Byju Raveendran and Byju’s Investments Pte Ltd tied to a 2022 $150 million loan for the Aakash acquisition, with interest sought at 4% per annum compounded daily from Feb. 28, 2024. The legal blows culminated in February 2025, when a U.S. bankruptcy court issued a summary judgment finding actual fraudulent transfers and breach of fiduciary duty related to the movement of funds through BYJU’s Alpha, marking one of the most significant legal setbacks in the company’s dramatic downfall. The myth of India’s innovation engine Once hailed as the future of Indian innovation, BYJU’s now serves as its cautionary tale. What began as a symbol of national pride, the story of a small startup that conquered global markets, has become a lesson in how hype and ego can outpace substance. In one of his last public interviews, founder Byju Raveendran dismissed the crisis, determined that he would see success again, saying,“Why I am confident of a comeback is that the most valuable thing I had is still with me,” referring to himself. It was a statement that perfectly captured the misplaced faith that defined BYJU’s rise, a belief not in innovation, governance or results, but in personality and perception. For years, U.S. investors, from BlackRock and UBS to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a single man and his myth, while American innovators back home struggled to break into markets dominated by foreign-backed giants. The question now is unavoidable: If so many investors were willing to stake billions on a person halfway around the world, why are they unwilling to back the homegrown entrepreneurs and talent right here in the United States, those who are locked out of markets increasingly monopolized by global capital and offshore influence? BYJU’s collapse is more than the downfall of a company; it is a mirror held up to a global investment culture that prizes narrative over national interest and speculation over stewardship. It is a reminder that the same investors who helped inflate the illusion of India’s innovation miracle have ignored the innovators in their own backyard. In the end, BYJU’s didn’t just fail as a business, it exposed the moral and economic blind spots of an era. The myth of India’s innovation engine has once again met the hard truth of execution and the cost was paid not only in rupees, but in large amounts of misplaced American capital.

Title: A $5 billion deal key to CoreWeave's AI empire just lost another investor's support

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

A Dublin man who was working in Texas while on a J1 visa has died following a road incident last Friday night. John Kirby, who was in his early 20s, is understood to have been knocked down by a truck in Austin, Texas. Mr Kirby was a business and marketing graduate. He suffered serious head injuries and was brought to a nearby hospital after the incident but died last Wednesday. The south county Dublin native had been in Texas with three Blackrock College schoolfriends. Blackrock College Rugby Football Club (RFC) paid tribute in a social media post. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they are “aware of the case and are providing consular assistance.” The director of Blackrock College RFC, Michael Hearty added his condolences saying it is with “deep sadness” that he shared the news of the passing. Mr Hearty said that Mr Kirby was a “much-loved member” of the Blackrock College RFC family, and his loss has been felt “profoundly” across the club and all teams. He continued: “I first met John in the summer of 2019 during preseason training. Immediately I was drawn to his infectious personality and big smile. He was charismatic, witty and very popular. “From the moment he pulled on the Rock jersey, he embodied everything our club stands for, commitment, friendship, and heart. He was a talented player, a dedicated team-mate, and above all, a guy who brought joy to everyone around him.” The director explained that Mr Kirby had that “special kind of presence”. “A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressingroom. Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. He was the sort of team-mate you were always happy to see walk through the door,” Mr Hearty noted. “His kindness, and sense of fun left a mark on everyone who knew him. The word no, wasn’t in his vocabulary.” His funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.

Title: Trump looks to cement his architectural legacy as Democrats bristle

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 17, 2025 / 4:52 PM EDT / CBS News Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project. Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through. Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert. Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News. Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors "mobbed" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event. Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either. But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed — and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing. Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom — even if they're powerless to stop its construction. California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it. CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure. "This is the White House — it's an emblem of our nation," Takano told CBS News. "It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace." Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction. Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message. The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from "his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care," Takano said. Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. "For me, it's like – I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with." Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm. Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a "world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," according to a company statement. An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said. The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has "definitely expanded," and its exact square footage is "not yet settled," according to a source familiar with the layout. It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase. The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given. CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests. The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. "We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network. The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials. Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House. A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News the White House and National Park Service are responsible for construction and design. So far, the Trust has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said. According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement. The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial. In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different. "Small, medium and large," Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. "I happen to think the large looks by far the best." Here's the full list of invitees to Mr. Trump's dinner: More than 100 were invited to President Trump's dinner Wednesday night, which was meant to thank financial donors who are funding the new White House ballroom. Those invited, including some who couldn't attend, according to CBS sources, were: Kathryn Watson contributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Today’s top news: It’s been a long-standing joke: “Are the sellers in the room with us?” Well, it turns out: Yes, indeed they are. According to JPMorgan, the sharp crypto correction last week in crypto and carrying through this week was largely self-inflicted. In a note to clients, the bank said the sell pressure came from crypto-native investors, not institutions. The data backs that up: While open interest on Binance and other offshore venues cratered, CME’s institutional contracts barely moved. It’s very much a tale of two markets. Regarding on-chain crypto, the more than $19 billion in liquidations that slammed the crypto market on Friday have tremendously impacted sentiment and prices, neither of which have yet to recover. Glassnode shows nearly $12 billion in futures open interest evaporated overnight, the biggest single-day decline in dollar terms ever. Yet, institutional flow looks calm. The ETFs have seen steady inflows through the turbulence. Across the past two weeks: CME’s Bitcoin open interest held steady, ETF outflows were minor, and Coinbase volumes even ticked up, suggesting that institutional money (smart money) mostly watched from the sidelines. This was the crypto casino cleaning itself out, not TradFi calling it quits. The institutions have mostly still been buying through the pain —so who has been selling? Answer: ancient whales and 4-year cycle believers. There’s plenty of data showing the amount of Bitcoin sold this year from those ancient whales, many of whom were up billions. They said they were going to dump their coins on Wall St., and then they did. And then one of the biggest anecdotal takeaways from the Asia crypto conference tour last month was that many Asian whales still believe in the 4-year cycle, and fully planned on selling this year aligned with prior cycles. While this has put us in a painful spot, there are reasons to be optimistic. Couple those reasons along with the recent on-chain leverage flushout and you have a nice foundation to set up a healthier base for the next leg upwards—not to mention the prospective gold-to-Bitcoin rally that typically takes place when gold leads (and boy, is it leading right now). So stay the course, bulls—this too shall pass.

Title: Is BlackRock About To Go Public With Ripple And XRP? Here’s What We Know

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are circulating that BlackRock has partnered with Ripple to tokenize real-world assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). There has been no confirmation from either party, suggesting that these rumors may not be accurate. In an X post, XRP influencer JackTheRippler said that there are rumors that BlackRock is about to announce a partnership with Ripple to tokenize assets on the XRPL. Other XRP influencers, such as CryptoSensei and Bale, also shared the rumor, sparking excitement among XRP community members. However, BlackRock and Ripple have yet to issue an official announcement about the rumored partnership, suggesting these claims may not be true. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink confirmed that they are building their own technology to tokenize several of their funds and expand their crypto offerings. The BlackRock CEO noted that tokenization can help crypto-native investors access more traditional assets. He further remarked that if they could tokenize an ETF, they could get these investors into the more traditional long-term retirement products. Notably, the asset manager already has products, such as its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which runs on the Ethereum network. It is worth mentioning that Ripple already partnered with the fund’s manager, Securitize, to enable off-ramp support for BlackRock’s BUIDL using their RLUSD stablecoin. This has so far been the closest to a partnership between Ripple and BlackRock amid rumors that the asset manager plans to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. However, Ripple has so far helped advance upgrades to the XRP Ledger, which could compel institutions like BlackRock to tokenize their funds on the XRPL. This has included the launch of the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which is designed to simplify the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). While rumors of a Ripple and BlackRock partnership do not appear to be accurate, there are other recent developments that provide a bullish outlook for XRP. This includes Ripple’s expansion into the corporate treasury markets through the $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a provider of treasury management systems. As part of the deal, Ripple and GTreasury will focus on enabling customers to carry out real-time cross-border payments using Ripple’s payment solution, in which XRP serves as the bridge currency. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Ripple is also working to raise up to $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury company. The crypto firm plans to contribute some of its XRP holdings to set up the firm, while the proposed $1 billion is expected to be raised through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In Manhattan, for example, the office vacancy rate hovers at a high of between 13 and 14 percent — nearly doubling the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 — while apartments come with sky-high rents and spark bidding wars, creating a perfect storm for a switch-up. According to recent Cushman & Wakefield data, the pace of New York’s office-to-residential conversions has probably never been faster (or at least it’s close to that milestone). Enter another major player intent on capitalizing on the trend. In April, developer Don Peebles of the Peebles Corporation and Doug McNeely, previously a partner at BlackRock and at Carlyle, announced the Donahue Douglas asset management firm: a $1.5 billion venture to buy offices in New York and elsewhere in the U.S. to convert into housing or hospitality. Office-to-residential conversions are not a new phenomenon, but the national scale of Donahue Douglas marks a major shift from firms or funds focused on a single conversion project or one specific region. “Most of my entire career has been focused on developing cities,” said Peebles. “We’re not going to go to New York City or Washington, D.C., and buy one building; we’re committing to these markets.” Together, McNeely and Peebles plan to buy and transform office buildings across U.S. cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Boston. The fund could spur at least $4.5 billion in apartment redevelopment, creating roughly 15,000 housing units, said Peebles. Additionally, Donahue Douglas is launching an emerging developer fund, with hopes to eventually employ minority developers for office conversion projects. “This is a long-term business for us,” said McNeely, “The secular headwinds that exist in office space right now, with structural shifts post-COVID, have created a real generational opportunity to invest in this space.” Since the pandemic, thousands of vacated office buildings have undergone makeovers, transforming into much-needed housing complexes. The United States reported a lineup of 55,300 office-to-residential units last year, with some 70,700 conversions planned for 2025, according to Yardi Matrix data. In New York City, notable office-to-residential conversion projects include the historic Emmet Building at 95 Madison Avenue and the Financial District’s newly opened 25 Water Street, the country’s largest conversion of its kind. Outside of New York City, developers from Detroit to Boston are seeking new opportunities in old buildings. These opportunities have ripple effects. “Putting capital and repositioning these buildings either turns around a neighborhood or prevents the neighborhood from ever facing issues with dark and vacant buildings and storefronts,” said Jeremy Shell, a principal with New York-based developer TF Cornerstone (who is not involved in the new fund). As of October, McNeely and Peebles were in the process of closing various commitments totaling nearly $1 billion of their planned $1.5 billion fund, said Peebles, who anticipates closing on that $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. Different investors have jumped on board, including large institutions such as state pension plans, as well as family offices, university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. Many institutional investors want to allocate significant funds between $100 million to $200 million each, said Peebles. Beyond any one investor, however, the fund has gained momentum by problem solving for the now. “In New York and many other markets, we have a housing crisis, and that is not only an affordable housing crisis — that is a general residential housing crisis,” said Shell. While many New Yorkers can anecdotally understand housing complaints, the statistics hammer home the point. Nationally, there’s a shortage of some 7 million affordable housing units and 4.5 million market-rate ones. In New York specifically, there’s little ground-up construction of multifamily apartments. Moreover, building costs have increased alongside spiking interest rates, inflation concerns and tariff uncertainties, said Shell. To address this staggering lag, state and local officials have enacted policies such as a major rezoning of Midtown South to incentivize office conversions, and a long-term property tax break known as 467-m. Such moves highlight a key player in pulling off large-scale office-to-residential conversions. “That’s really step one: the city getting behind creating or recreating these buildings,” said Andrew Barrocas, CEO of MNS Real Estate (who is also not involved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). But policy alone is not enough to pull off nationwide conversion projects. Rather, a workforce tax credit program and financial incentives are crucial to producing more housing. Tax credit programs allow Peebles and McNeely to create a range of housing, from affordable to higher-end luxury apartments, depending on each building, said Peebles. Meanwhile, Congress earlier this year modified the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, making the production of affordable housing more attractive to developers, and tax credits easier for them to use. The closure of all kinds of offices has exposed the potential for a fund like the one proposed by Peebles and McNeely. Empty offices in New York City have caused small businesses to shutter, while those in Downtown Washington, D.C., have created something of a ghost town, snowballing into vacant retail and the closure of small businesses. Washington, D.C., therefore tops the list of Donahue Douglas’ geographic points of interest, as the firm’s investment strategy focuses on large, major markets; strong, solid underlying fundamentals; significant distress; and entrepreneurial opportunities, said Peebles. “No. 2, we really see San Francisco as an environment of great opportunity,” said Peebles, who pinpointed the city’s politics and focus on crime and quality of life issues. He additionally cited Dallas, Austin, South Florida and Boston as areas with major conversion potential. Replacing offices with apartments can revive neighborhoods and create more vibrant, vital, economically resilient and equitable places, said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. Across neighborhoods, Peebles and McNeely plan to purchase a combination of both healthy buildings and those under significant duress, said McNeely. Some of these offices will be more bare-bones buildings at the end of their physical and economic lives, while others will be newer skyscrapers that have lost their tenants. Peebles doesn’t consider New York City among Donahue Douglas’ top five cities. But its neighborhoods still present opportunities for both conversions and ground-up development projects through Donahue Douglas’ emerging developer fund. “Our business strategy will be the real estate investment strategy of the future,” said Peebles. “The institutional investors and institutional developers have proven that they can never meet the needs of the public when it comes to housing. … There’s a demand for a new class of developers and investors, and capital to go to them.” As for the New York City areas well positioned to benefit from office-to-residential changes? Barrocas singled out business-heavy neighborhoods like Midtown East and Midtown West. Neighborhoods like the Financial District, Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn are similarly prime for conversion projects. In Midtown, the Garment District is likewise ripe for office-to-residential changes, said Kaplan. Not only is the area accessible to the subway, but it also has loft-type buildings that are relatively easy to transform into apartments. Sure, the neighborhood is missing green spaces, said Kaplan, but those residential aspects are likely to arise after housing arrives. After all, “it’s faster to convert than it is to build new,” said Kaplan. Meaning, converting buildings can — and likely will — revive neighborhoods more efficiently than new construction. (Another bonus: Conversions are also the more sustainable option, as concrete and steel are major sources of embedded carbon.) For proof, take Manhattan’s Financial District circa the 1990s. Back then, the neighborhood was predominantly offices. After an early 2000s recession and the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the values of those office properties declined. Plus, city zoning reforms in the previous decade — among tax incentives and lower-priced office buildings — spurred the conversion of larger offices, said Francis Greenburger, CEO and founder of Time Equities (and uninvolved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). “When you have vacant storefronts, vacant buildings, less pedestrian traffic around these buildings and neighborhoods, there’s risk of this downward spiral, and we’ve seen it,” said Shell, whose TF Cornerstone was responsible for various FiDi conversions. Once housing moved into the Financial District, so did shops, cafes and restaurants to feed and entertain those new residents. Neighborhood residents require everything from garbage pickup to quieter streets, as well as supermarkets, restaurants and cultural venues. “It takes a long time for the locations to provide the sort of infrastructure that residential tenants want,” said Greenburger, who believes the trend of conversions could potentially taper off within the next two to three years, once suitable office buildings are all scooped up. “Changing the office buildings isn’t the entire equation.” Nor is doing away with workspaces altogether. “As it pertains to New York City, we’re being very innovative,” said McNeely. “So, we’re going to couple conversions with smart working spaces. [We will] take 21st-century working spaces, where people are going to be very interested in not only living in the building, but also taking part in the neighborhood. We really want to focus on not only the building, but the amenities within and surrounding the building.” Anna Staropoli can be reached at astaropoli@commercialobserver.com.

The withdrawal contributed to a brutal Thursday across Bitcoin ETFs, which collectively bled $530.9 million, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock's IBIT lost $29.5 million, Fidelity's FBTC dropped $132 million, and Grayscale's GBTC shed $45 million, pointing to a broad institutional retreat from Bitcoin exposure. The week proved punishing for Bitcoin products overall, with $858.7 million in net outflows and only Tuesday breaking the exodus with a single day of inflows. The exodus comes as markets continue to absorb shocks from President Donald Trump's 100% tariff announcement on China last Friday, which triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. China on Thursday nodded openness to trade talks while accusing the U.S. of creating "panic" over Beijing's rare earth export controls, offering a potential off-ramp as both nations work toward a planned meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. "There is a short-medium term shift, especially post the comments on last Friday towards a more risk-off state, especially given market exuberance across risk assets and uncorrelated assets over the last few months," Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. The combination of the Ethereum-based USDe stablecoin’s depeg on Friday and a social media-driven boycott movement against Binance has pushed concerns about systemic risk back into focus, particularly at this stage of the post-halving Bitcoin cycle, he added. Despite managing just 50,000 BTC versus BlackRock's 800,000 and Fidelity's 210,000, ARKB "is generally one of the funds leading the charge" on outflow days, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, told Decrypt, adding how "ARK's holdings have held consistently in the 40-50K BTC since March 2024." ARK's fund sees "investors more frequently rotate in and out of BTC as a speculative asset" compared to BlackRock and Fidelity's vehicles, which house longer-term holders, he said. Whether the Bitcoin ETF outflow streak continues depends on upcoming catalysts, particularly the Federal Reserve's October 29 FOMC meeting and the ongoing Q3 earnings season, Mahidhar said. “Market exuberance needs to be supported by revenue and cash flow growth in U.S. markets — if that happens and the FOMC meeting goes well, we may see a staunching in the bleed out,” he noted. Bitcoin is trading at $104,629, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, still nursing losses from the tariff-triggered crash.

Title: BlackRock Plans Tokenization as IBIT Surpasses $100B in AUM and $HYPER’s Presale Reaches $23.9M

Time Published: 2025-10-17T09:02:28Z
Full Content:
Quick Facts: 1️⃣ BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT surpassed $100B less than two years after its release on January 11, 2024. 2️⃣ Larry Fink announced a long-term plan to tokenize all assets, from funds to stocks and cash. 3️⃣ Fink argues that bubbles don’t impact long-term investors and that time in the market outweighs opportunistic buy-ins. 4️⃣ Bitcoin’s Layer 2 project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) reaches $23.9M in presale and eyes a Q1 2026 release. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) just surpassed $100B in assets under management (AUM), which prompted CEO Larry Fink to announce the company’s tokenization plans. Fink made the comments during a CNBC interview, where he said: I do believe we’re just at the beginning of tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board. —Larry Fink, CNBC Interview This comes over a year and a half after BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, on the Ethereum network by partnering with Securitize. In the official press release, Securitize’s co-founder and CEO, Carlos Domingo, said that BUIDL proves that tokenization is essentially unstoppable and that it will transform the capital market. With over $1T in AUM, BlackRock’s decision to invest in tokenization tech stems from Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s success, especially amid 2025’s rampant adoption wave. This spells good news for Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $23.9M presale which feeds Bitcoin’s coming Layer 2 with a projected Q1 2026 public launch. Fink believes that asset tokenization is imminent and the key step to attracting digital investors into the TradFi market, which pack more unpopular products like retirement funds. The overarching goal is to allow investors to hold multiple assets together, including funds, cash, and cryptos, which would represent a turning point for the capital market as a whole. To that end, Fink pushes for ‘time in the market,’ as opposed to opportunistic buy-ins, as an anti-bubble strategy. As he sees it, it’s only opportunistic buyers who push the notion of financial bubbles due to their short time in the market. This doesn’t happen with long-term investors who ride the bubbles to follow the larger trend. If you put money to work on January 1st, 2000, a year later you had the Dot Com crysis, six years later you had the financial crisis, you had the COVID crysis; you still would’ve made 8% compound interest over the entire 25 years. It’s not about if our markets are going up or down […] it’s about being in the market for the entire cycle. —Larry Fink, CNBC interview The same mindset applies to the digital market and Bitcoin is the living proof of that. While opportunistic snipers often find themselves in hot waters – last Friday’s market crash anyone? – long-term investors who bought $BTC in 2011 are now up 169,000,000%. Bitcoin’s recent performance only adds to that. $BTC now trades at just under $106K after a 13.7% drop over the last week, which is painful for leverage traders, but neutral for long-term investors, because Bitcoin will eventually bounce back. Especially with Bitcoin Hyper just around the corner. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address Bitcoin’s most pressing problem: its performance limitation. With a hard cap of seven transactions per second (TPS), Bitcoin currently ranks 22nd on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS. This translates to slow confirmation times, high fees, and lack of scalability. Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to change that. Once the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms incoming transactions in milliseconds, the Bridge then mints the bitcoins on the Hyper layer, allowing you to use the wrapped assets with near-instant finality within the Layer 2 ecosystem. Long-term, Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a more feasible option for institutional investors by making the network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. The project is seeing outstanding investor support, managing to reach $23.9M since its beginning and it’s still growing fast. $HYPER is available right now at the presale price of $0.013125, which could be the lowest you could ever buy the token at.

A consortium consisting of the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), MGX, and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers for an enterprise value of around $40bn. The deal will help increase the scale of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Aligned’s current owners Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) and its co-investment partners will sell their entire equity stake. In an interview with Reuters, MAM head Ben Way said the sale “was not a warning sign for the sector or AI”. Way was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We don’t own businesses in perpetuity, we have owned this for seven years and it’s at a great spot to exit and there’s clearly massive demand to exit.” The acquisition is AIP’s first investment as it pursues its goal to deploy $30bn in equity capital, with a longer-term target that could reach $100bn when including debt. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Aligned Data Centers operates hyperscale and enterprise data centres and currently manages a portfolio of 50 campuses and over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Its facilities are located in major digital gateway regions in the US and Latin America, including Chicago, Dallas, Northern Virginia, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Queretaro. Aligned will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and its current executive team from its Dallas headquarters following acquisition. Schaap said: “Partnering with the consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data centre infrastructure.” Since Macquarie Asset Management’s initial investment in 2018 via Macquarie Infrastructure Partners IV, and an increased stake through Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V in 2020, Aligned has expanded from two facilities with 85MW of capacity to its current scale. The company introduced both green securitisation and sustainability-linked financing models to the data centre sector during this period. The acquisition is intended to provide Aligned with capital and resources required to expand its presence and meet demand for high-density, scalable compute infrastructure. The consortium’s investment brings operational experience across AI infrastructure deployment and management. AIP chairman and BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said: “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilising private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” Subject to regulatory clearance and standard closing requirements, the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026. AIP was established by BlackRock, GIP, MGX, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with the objective of scaling AI infrastructure capacity. The partnership’s primary financial backers include the Kuwait Investment Authority and Temasek.

Title: Bitcoin must upgrade or fall victim to quantum computing attack in 5 years

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/16/2025 9:30:56 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Unless Bitcoin upgrades its core cryptography in the next five years, the trust it has built over 16 years could be wiped out by a single quantum attack. Urgent upgrades are needed to protect the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed how we define money. In response to the 2008 collapse of the financial institutions in which millions put their trust, Satoshi created a decentralized monetary system built on elliptic curve cryptography. This combination of cold math and decentralization was a powerful one, attracting not only diehard skeptics but also the world’s largest financial institutions, such as BlackRock. In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming.

When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late.

Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late.

A MAN WHOSE skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine at the side of a road in Co Cork had sustained multiple fractures to his skull and body consistent with the use of a hammer like weapon, a murder trial has heard. The remains of Kieran Quilligan were discovered after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on 29 January, 2024. The 47 year old, who was from Togher in Cork city, was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) are on trial in the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork charged with his murder. Today the jury heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who attended at the scene where the remains of Mr Quilligan were found. Dr Bolster said that that on examination of the jute bag the first thing she saw was the pelvic bone protruding. The skull was separate from the body. She noted that there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster subsequently carried out a postmortem examination on Mr Quilligan on 30 January, 2024 at Cork University Hospital. Advertisement She said that a cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, Dr Bolster stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, femur, knee, skull and face. Dr Bolster said that there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word ‘Mother’ and a date. A further inscription was illegible. Meanwhile, the jury of ten men and two women also heard evidence today that one of the accused men, Niall Long, had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. The message was sent after she texted him saying that the jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt Maurice O’Connor said that Mr Long texted his mother back and said that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The case continues tomorrow in front of Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and the jury. The prosecution in the case claim that the accused men killed Mr Quilligan in a “joint enterprise.” The charge facing both accused is that the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long previously of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork and and Luke Taylor formerly of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in the city both deny murdering Mr Quilligan.

Title: Fractures of skeletal remains suggest victim suffered severe assault, murder trial hears

A 47-year-old man whose skeletal remains were found more than five months after he went missing suggest he suffered multiple fractures to bones in his head, face and torso, a murder trial heard on Thursday. Kieran Quilligan had suffered a significant assault with some blunt implement such as a hammer, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster told the trial of co-accused Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Both Mr Long, of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Mr Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, have denied the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024. On Thursday, Dr Bolster told the jury of 10 men and two women that she conducted a postmortem on the skeletal remains of Mr Quilligan, which had been found by a cadaver dog under a jute bag in scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, in east Cork on January 29th, 2024. She was not able to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died nor was she able to give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem. Dr Bolster revealed that Mr Quilligan had both old, healed fractures as well as more recent newer fractures and the latter included fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jaw bone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. “Fractures don’t cause death, it is usually trauma to underlying organs, but I could not establish the cause of death because there were no organs left,” said Dr Bolster, as she explained the lack of tissue and organs also meant she could not carry out any toxicology tests on Mr Quilligan. Cross-examined by Brendan Grehan SC for Mr Taylor, she agreed if Mr Quilligan had been shot in the head, there would be evidence of this in his skull and similarly a stab wound to the torso could leave marks on bones, but she found no evidence of either on his skeletal remains. Dr Bolster said that several of Mr Quilligan’s fractures, including one to his jaw and one to his thigh bone, were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all, they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”. She said she believed two pieces of knotted plastic found tied around Mr Quilligan’s neck area were unusual ligatures and were more likely used to lift the remains. She also believed that a ratchet type cable tying his legs together was also used to lift and move the remains. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor of how he seized a number of mobile phones as part of the investigation, including one from Mr Long’s home at St Michael’s Close on September 15th, 2023. Gardaí were able to retrieve texts sent and received by the phones. He said he found a message on the phone seized at St Michael’s Close which belonged to Mr Long’s mother, Janice, sent on 6.23pm on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she had noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her Toyota Rav car. Sgt O’Connor said that although gardaí were not able to locate the phone from which a reply was sent, they were able to establish the content of the message in which the sender admitted that there may have been a smell in the boot of Ms Long’s Toyota Rav jeep. “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned,” said the sender. The jury were earlier told they would hear evidence the accused used Ms Long’s jeep to transport Mr Qulligan’s body. The case continues.

Title: Florida introduces new bill to establish Bitcoin and digital asset reserves
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/florida-proposes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-public-funds/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:48:30Z

Share this article Florida has introduced a new bill that would authorize the state to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The legislation, filed as House Bill 183 and sponsored by Rep. Webster Barnaby, would allow the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the State Board of Administration to manage portions of state funds in Bitcoin and digital asset exchange-traded products. The move aligns with broader institutional adoption trends. The US established a strategic Bitcoin reserve managed by the Treasury in 2025, incorporating forfeited assets as a store of value. Institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity have expanded Bitcoin-related fund offerings, supporting the infrastructure that could facilitate state-level adoption. Recent policies allowing digital assets in retirement plans have created a precedent for Florida’s reserve strategy. The legislation represents Florida’s effort to position itself among states pioneering crypto asset integration into public investment frameworks, treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve option alongside traditional state fund allocations.

European stocks advanced on Thursday as investors took largely upbeat corporate earnings to heart amid easing political tensions after French prime minister Sébastien Lecornu survived a confidence vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.45 per cent. Wall Street stocks advanced and gold prices surged ever upward on Thursday as solid corporate earnings helped investors look past simmering trade tensions between the United States and China. All three major US stock indexes followed their European counterparts to modest gains, while safe-haven seekers continued to send gold to fresh highs DUBLIN Shares in mining company Kenmare Resources traded flat after a wobble in the previous session on back of statements production of ilmenite – it’s most important mineral – will be towards the lower end of guidance this year. Bank of Ireland closed marginally down by 0.54 per cent. Food group Glanbia and budget airline Ryanair rose upon the positive tide, closing the session up 1.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively. EUROPE In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed up 1.4 per cent, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.4 per cent. In France, prime minister Sébastien Lecornu weathered two confidence motions, just days after appointing his new government and making a key political concession to stay in power. The votes followed Mr Lecornu’s decision Tuesday to back suspending a divisive 2023 pension reform, in a bid to keep his cabinet afloat long enough to pass a much-needed austerity budget by year’s end. In Zurich, Nestle stormed 9.3 per cent higher after announcing plans to cut around 16,000 jobs globally over the next two years, as new chief executive officer Philipp Navratil steps up restructuring to revive growth and profitability at the Swiss food conglomerate. The move forms part of an expanded cost-savings programme. Nestle also reported third quarter organic growth of 4.3 per cent, well ahead of 3.7 per cent expected by analysts. Real internal growth improved to 1.5 per cent, ahead of 0.3 per cent consensus, recovering from negative trends earlier in the year. LONDON Blue chips in London nudged higher on Thursday despite sluggish economic growth in August and a 10 per cent drop for Premier Inn owner Whitbread. The FTSE 100 index was little changed at 9,436.09. The UK economy achieved only minor growth in August, numbers from the Office for National Statistics showed, while the reading for July was downwardly revised. Earlier this week, UK chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged she was looking at potential tax rises and spending cuts to fill a black hole in her budget. On the FTSE 100, Whitbread tumbled 10 per cent as lower earnings, higher debt, and growing economic uncertainty in the UK all weighed, despite a pickup in trading at Premier Inn. Whitbread said pretax profit fell 7.1 per cent to £287 million in the half-year that ended August 28 from £309 million a year earlier. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called Whitbread’s results “another weak performance”, saying that earnings in reverse and net debt on the rise is the “kind of news that makes investors suffer from insomnia”. NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed on Thursday, as financial companies dragged while chip stocks extended their rally following a strong quarterly update from TSMC that reinforced investor optimism around AI. Shares of some major US chipmakers also advanced, building on gains from Wednesday when ASML’s solid quarterly results and a $40 billion (€34 billion) data centre deal by BlackRock and a Nvidia-backed group fuelled optimism around AI. Nvidia rose 1 per cent, Micron Technology added 5.6 per cent and Broadcom gained 1.1 per cent. Salesforce rose 4.1 per cent as it forecast revenue of more than $60 billion for 2030, above Wall Street estimates. “The Nasdaq is having a pretty good day, being driven higher by the semiconductors and the software side of things,” said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. Among other moves, Hewlett Packard Enterprise slumped 10.5 per cent after it forecast annual profit and revenue below Wall Street expectations. JB Hunt shares jumped 19.3 per cent after a higher third-quarter profit. – Additional reporting by Reuters Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How CIOs Can Comply With International Data Privacy Laws
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2025/10/16/how-cios-can-comply-with-international-data-privacy-laws/

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Governance is increasingly more important as cybersecurity risks grow in number, capabilities and scope, but even companies that have excellent governance in some areas might not be covering everything. A new report from data security platform Kiteworks found that several companies are failing at managed file transfer protection—and many of the vulnerabilities are relatively easy to identify and solve. Nearly six in 10 companies had a file transfer security incident in the last year, but priority is not placed on the steps to protect them. “Organizations check compliance boxes while missing fundamental governance,” Kiteworks Chief Strategy Officer Tim Freestone said in a statement. “They can’t tell you where sensitive files are stored, who accessed them last week, or how they move between systems. Without this visibility, even sophisticated security tools become expensive decorations.” Many enterprises are missing out on places to add security that don’t necessarily require new tools or knowhow, Kiteworks found. Three-quarters use end-to-end encryption for data that is in transit, but just 42% use an AES-256 encryption standard for data that is in storage, making it easier for bad actors to steal and exploit. Only about a third have integrated file transfer with their security team and its systems. And only a quarter test their file transferring security regularly. How can these holes be plugged? Kiteworks recommends companies stop buying new tools and instead come up with comprehensive data governance standards that cover files and transfers. This kind of governance is not just helpful from a security perspective, but it also helps enterprises keep better track of all of their data. Paying closer attention also helps identify where cybersecurity risks are lurking, enabling the enterprise to get ahead of threats, which is vital in today’s business environment. Another vital aspect of business is online privacy—a sometimes thorny topic because different states, countries and geopolitical zones have their own distinct sets of laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of data privacy platform Clarip, about how companies can stay in compliance everywhere and still do business. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. We are currently accepting nominations for the Forbes CIO Next 2025 list. We’re looking for innovators who have had significant impacts both at their own companies and for other tech leaders on the whole. (And yes, you can nominate yourself.) Nominations are accepted until 5 p.m. ET on October 30. It seems that 2025 is the year of the AI megadeal, and it’s getting difficult to keep track of who’s investing in or partnering with whom. Just this week, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure announced it will deploy AMD’s Instinct MI450 chips starting in Q3 of 2026. A consortium of Big Tech investors—including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI—plans to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. And OpenAI entered what’s likely a multimillion-dollar deal to roll out a custom AI chip with Broadcom. While some of the tech giants have enormous revenues, they’re still taking on debt to bolster their offerings and build infrastructure, like data centers. OpenAI, for instance, is not expected to break even for years to come. The enormous amounts of cash involved and huge investments around AI have inspired comparisons to the dot-com stock market bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan writes about the similarities between both periods of tech growth and enthusiasm, and predicts what fallout might look like for the economy. The bigger question, Cohan writes, is whether the economy is ready for it. Another question worth asking is whether this approach to AI will actually help the U.S. stay ahead in the race to dominate the technology. Forbes contributor Vivian Toh writes that while the U.S. is forming several capital—and debt—heavy alliances for AI, Chinese firms are focusing on open-source and easily adaptable technology. Toh writes that the AI race looks less like a sprint for maximizing intelligence and is now more about infrastructure. The biggest question is who can balance scaling the technology and maintain its resilience, she writes. AI is everywhere, and Oracle is unveiling its new starring role in its ERP and operational work at its AI World event this week—known as CloudWorld until this year. Forbes contributor Robert Kramer writes that Oracle is bringing AI agents into many of its enterprise cloud software suites. A payables agent automates invoicing in Oracle’s Fusion Cloud ERP and EPM. A ledger agent provides accountants with continuous insight. A planning agent supports event-driven forecasting. For supply chain, agents now automate several planning, fulfillment and compliance processes that could take hours to resolve manually. Oracle’s new agents, Kramer writes, are focused on intelligent and accountable AI. At the event, they’re demonstrating how to trace and review agent decisions for compliance, which can especially help companies in highly regulated industries. Kramer writes this stance on AI agents is intended to meet companies where they are, integrating new capabilities into the functions they’re already using. Much has been said about how AI-powered coding can transform the programming industry. But is AI-generated code any good? Forbes senior contributor Adrian Bridgwater took a deep dive into this question, asking Yrieix Garnier, vice president of product at Datadog for his observations. So far, many of the problems between expectations and output come from prompting. Better code, Bridgwater writes, comes from more structured and detailed instructions of what it needs to do and how. The only context that should be included is that which is immediately relevant—extra context may lead to coding errors. But with access to the right data and in the optimal setup, an AI coding app can be a valuable collaborator, he writes. Data privacy is becoming an increasingly more important topic, especially as different countries and states roll out different privacy laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of AI-powered data privacy company Clarip, about how companies can ensure that they are in compliance wherever they operate. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. When privacy laws in Europe went into effect, there were different instances of some social media platforms that complied with those jurisdictions’ more stringent privacy requirements. Are the platforms still working on multiple versions, or are they figuring out how to make one system that follows privacy laws? Sambandam: We are a data privacy platform. We’re right in the middle of this thing, and we have a lot of customers that have presence in the EU, in Germany and Spain and in Italy and France and U.K. Companies still, even to this day, take an approach where they [decide], ‘Hey, if a visitor’s coming in from the EU or to our site in the EU, then we’re not going to track this data. Or if it’s coming from America and a certain state, we’re going to not do anything. We’re going to collect all the data and share it freely.’ This has actually given a raise to a pretty interesting subset of services. There are companies using IP address to understand where you’re coming from, which city or country you belong to. You can make a call to understand where that user is coming from: Is [a person] coming from Germany or is she coming from Virginia? Those types of calls are happening seamlessly behind the scenes. These providers are growing tremendously because companies started using some of these tools behind the scenes. The tools, whether it’s ours or other tools, have technology to tweak or configure their platform so that they can decide where somebody is coming from and then track or not track, or use third-party cookies or not use third-party cookies. Tech companies are made up of people who create the tech part, but then there are different departments, like legal and marketing. Do they understand exactly what the ramifications are between privacy laws and what they mean to all countries? The simple and honest answer to your question is not at all. They don’t understand. I see this personally in many of the large Fortune 100 companies that I engage with. The person in the IT world, for example, they’re not really thinking about privacy. If you’re a CIO, you are a business person saying, ‘Hey, I need this feature to be built.’ The developer, the engineer, they’re just going and writing a piece of code. Especially in the last 10, 15 years, software development has almost become like Lego building blocks. If you want to build something, you go download some existing library and then build things on top of it. By nature, software is collecting and sharing data downstream. The IT person or the engineers, they’re not really thinking privacy that much, but the legal and compliance people are. At the same time, I’ve seen marketing and sales team members, for them, data collection and analytics is super important so that they can do retargeting. You’ve probably seen this: You’re looking for something or talking to your friend about a certain thing, and all of a sudden you start seeing ads for that red sweater or shoes or ticket to the Caribbean. It’s a complex issue. The marketing team [can go to] extra lengths to find ways to circumvent these privacy laws. But then the privacy teams are like, ‘Hey, no, you’re not supposed to do this because we have these laws.’ I’ve seen companies where if the chief compliance officer or legal officer [comes from] a much larger state, those companies’ privacy programs will be more strict and stringent. Where the marketing rules, you’re going to see they have the upper hand. What do you suggest that a company working in this space do to make sure that they are complying with all applicable laws everywhere without being too careful? Try to do what’s in the best interest of your customers. If you have consent from your customers to share data, then do that. But you have to be upfront about it. How often do you actually read terms and conditions or a privacy notice top to bottom? Never, right? It’s simplifying that and telling people what data are you collecting, who are you going to share with and how are you going to use it. If you can show that true value proposition, people are willing to share. If you want to receive coupons for Black Friday, $25 off or 25% off, but you’ve got to give an email address or sign up for a newsletter, then you’re going to do it. You’ve got to avoid dark patterns. Don’t try to sneak something in the middle of your privacy policy that’s 4,000 words long. Sometimes, the company is challenged on what they say in the project policy is one thing. What’s actually happening behind the scenes is something else. Legal people don’t understand technology evolving, and they may have returned a project policy 12 months ago that’s no longer valid. Now, something’s changed in that technology ecosystem. Doing annual checks or quarterly audits, and being transparent, getting consent are some big common sense things you can do that could get you out of trouble and that would help you in the balances. While AI can work harder than a person, it can also fail harder. Here are some tips to maximize the assistance you get from the technology and prevent the deepest pitfalls. In order to lead to growth, AI innovation needs safeguards and governance, but it also needs to be able to compete—something proven by the recipients of this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics.

Title: Kieran Quilligan suffered multiple fractures, court hears
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1016/1538977-quilligan-trial/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:14:38Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The trial of two men for the murder of Kieran Quilligan - who had been missing for five months - has been told that there were multiple fractures to his bones, consistent with blows from a blunt weapon, similar to a hammer. However, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she could not say what the cause of death was, or when Mr Quilligan died, due to the level of body decompositon which meant there were no organs to examine or toxicology reports available. Kieran Quilligan, who was 47, was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His body was found in a jute bag in a ravine at Whitewell, adjacent to the Midleton to Whitegate road, on 28 January 2024. Luke Taylor, 27, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon in Cork, both deny murdering Mr Quilligan. In her evidence at the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, Dr Bolster said that before she carried out a post-mortem examination, she examined the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine, 8-10m from the roadway, where there was a jute bag covered in mud and vegetation. Underneath this was another jute bag, she said, "partially open, with a pelvic bone protruding". Dr Bolster also said that she could see ribs and "a huge skull with a bag around it, tied with a knot". She told the jury of two women and ten men that the post-mortem the following day revealed multiple fractures to the bones, both old and recent. Recent traumas, she said, included displaced fractures to both head and neck, fractures to the left ankle, fractures to the cheekbones, a depressed fracture to the left of the skull extending to the top of the head, and across the palate. There were fractures to the upper and lower jaw bones, with only one tooth remaining either at death or post-mortem. There were also multiple fractures to the chest and ribs, a displaced fracture to the right scapula with a small piece of bone missing, a fracture of the right upper limb, as well as a lower limb fracture of the right thigh bone, suggesting a blow with a blunt instrument, like a hammer, Dr Bolster said. Mr Quilligan had received multiple blows of a blunt weapon, like a hammer, she added. But as no internal organs were left, or toxicology available, she could not say what the cause of death was, or determine a precise cause. Under cross-examination by Ray Boland, Senior Counsel for Niall Long, Dr Bolster said that Mr Quilligan's drug use would have increased his vulnerability to death by assault. Asked by Senior Counsel Brendan Grehan, for Luke Taylor, about the plastic bags with knots around the victim's neck, Dr Bolster said that it looked like they were used to move the body. "There's no evidence that there were bags over the head of the deceased. They were possibly used as a ligature, possibly used to carry the body," she said. The pathologist also indicated that there was no evidence of a shooting or stab wounds. Another witness, Sergeant Maurice O'Connor, of Anglesea Street Garda Station, gave evidence of examining mobile phones seized during a search of a house in Mahon two weeks after Mr Quilligan was reported missing. In particular, he referred to Whatsapp messages between Janice Long, and her son, Niall Long. In a message, sent on 2 September, she asked: "Ok, my jeep stinks of Dettol?" and the reply from his mobile number was: "Yeah, it does. The fella who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and was thrown in the boot", Sgt O'Connor told the court. The trial before Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford has adjourned for the day and will continue tomorrow. © RTÉ 2025.

The Wall Street giant said Thursday it will retool one of its money market funds to cater explicitly to U.S. stablecoin issuers, by making the fund an approved reserve asset for such tokens under the recently passed GENIUS Act. The BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL) will remove agency investments, shorten the maturity of its investments in U.S. Treasuries, and add overnight repurchase agreements as an eligible asset, in a bid to make the fund both compliant with GENIUS and maximally liquid for stablecoin issuers. Jon Steel, global head of product for BlackRock’s cash management business, said Thursday that the company has seen increased demand from stablecoin issuers seeking reserve management options in the wake of GENIUS’s passage. “We believe [the fund] positions BlackRock as one of the reserve asset managers of choice for the digital payments ecosystem,” Steel said in a statement. BlackRock’s bold push into stablecoin reserves is all but certain to have a significant impact on the sector. Earlier this week, the company reported that its cash management business has surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time ever. Its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are also handily the largest trading on Wall Street. Today’s development is far from the firm’s first stablecoin foray, though. In 2022, BlackRock led a $400 million funding round for USDC issuer Circle, in a deal that made the asset manager a primary holder of Circle’s reserves. Crypto has been top of mind for BlackRock this week. On Tuesday, the company’s CEO, Larry Fink, announced the firm is currently developing its own technology to tokenize all manner of traditional assets. “It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said at the time. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: How The SEC’s Ethereum Nod Could Unlock A Trillion-Dollar Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonegilsson/2025/10/16/how-the-secs-ethereum-nod-could-unlock-a-trillion-dollar-market/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T16:02:28Z

ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. “I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets — from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board,” said Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, in an interview with CNBC. Coming from the world’s largest asset manager, it’s a strong signal. In parallel, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took a quieter but equally telling step: a nod to Ethereum’s ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into digital tokens. In plain terms, it means law can now travel with the asset — every share, bond, or fund can carry its own rules, embedded directly in its software code — the smart contract. That shift is dramatically accelerating a trillion-dollar tokenized asset market, where law and regulatory compliance move with the asset and live on the blockchain. When SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins explicitly refers to a blockchain token standard, it’s a sign that finance itself is changing. In a recent speech, Atkins described how compliance requirements could be written directly into smart contracts — citing ERC-3643, the Ethereum-based standard that embeds regulatory safeguards into tokenized securities. It was a subtle but historic moment. A top U.S. regulator recognizing code itself as a tool to ensure regulatory compliance on-chain. The idea behind ERC-3643 is simple but radical — make regulation part of the token itself. Each token carries its own rulebook: who can hold it, where it can trade, and when it can be redeemed. Every transfer automatically checks both sides for legal eligibility. If conditions aren’t met, the transaction never happens. When I met Luc Falempin, co-author of the protocol and co-founder of the startup Tokeny, he recalled the problem that started it all. “Financial institutions loved blockchain but couldn’t use it,” he said. “The tools were outdated, and compliance was manual. We made the rules part of the asset.” That insight led to T-REX, meaning ‘token for regulated exchanges,’ developed for real-world projects tokenizing equities and real estate with regulators involved from the start. Formalized in a 2018 white paper, it became ERC-3643 in 2021, the Ethereum standard for permissioned tokens that can move peer-to-peer yet remain fully compliant. Ethereum’s open standards power everything from stablecoins to NFTs. ERC-3643 adds a missing layer — a framework for regulated assets that embeds compliance directly into code. It lets law move with the asset. Built on Ethereum’s familiar architecture, ERC-3643 adds identity checks and transfer rules where required by law. Instead of building closed systems, institutions can plug into the same open infrastructure that powers DeFi. “Stablecoins and NFTs changed what could exist on-chain,” said Falempin. “ERC-3643 changes who can hold it and how. It connects innovation to regulation.” While most institutions were experimenting with private blockchains or proprietary solutions, Falempin’s team built openly on Ethereum. “The public EVM ecosystem gave us the libraries, the community, and the speed we needed,” he said. That choice saved years of development and ensured ERC-3643 works across networks. By encoding compliance in open standards, rather than proprietary systems, Tokeny showed that open source can lead to business wins in finance just like it does in the field of technology. In his July 2025 address, Atkins outlined how tokenized assets could comply through “principles-based conditions” rather than rigid, outdated rules — including “verified-pool” functionality and token standards with built-in compliance features such as ERC-3643. The head of the world’s most powerful securities agency cited an Ethereum standard as a model for how law itself can operate on-chain. When legal scholar Lawrence Lessig warned that “code is law” in his book "Code Version 2.0"," he meant that software could shape behavior as powerfully as legislation. Two decades later, that idea has flipped. Law itself now runs on code — embedded directly into digital assets so compliance executes automatically. With ERC-3643, regulation isn’t enforced later; it happens in real time. The law no longer follows the asset. Instead, law travels with it. In May 2025, Apex Group, a 13,000-employee financial-services firm with more than $3 trillion under management, acquired a majority stake in Tokeny and appointed Falempin as the new Head of Product for Apex Digital. It wasn’t an exit — it was a convergence. Apex brings regulatory infrastructure and clients; Tokeny brings the technology and the open standard. “We’re building the digital rails institutions can trust,” Falempin said. “If you lose your wallet, your assets can be recovered. If you change blockchains, your identity follows. That’s how traditional finance works — and how on-chain finance should.” Citi-backed research estimates that $5 trillion of traditional securities could be tokenized by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group puts it closer to $16 trillion. Either way, scale demands compliance. ERC-3643 offers precisely that — compliance by design. A fund issued in Luxembourg can now be held by an investor in Singapore, settled instantly on-chain, and remain compliant in both jurisdictions — because the rules are embedded in the token itself. When asked what legacy he hopes ERC-3643 will leave, Falempin paused.“Now that we have open and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure, along with a compliant token protocol, we have a massive opportunity to upgrade the financial system,” he said. “Traditional finance is slow, costly, and inaccessible because it relies on endless reconciliation. Blockchain can change that. I believe most capital markets will move on-chain within the next ten years.” The era of tokenized real-world assets is no longer hypothetical — it’s here. And at its core lies a protocol few outside the industry have heard of: ERC-3643, the Ethereum standard turning the promise of tokenized finance into a trillion-dollar reality. What began as an experiment in code is fast becoming one of the new operating systems of global finance.

BlackRock is expanding its crypto footprint with a new fund tailored for stablecoin issuers. The BSTBL aims to streamline reserve management under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock has launched the Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund for stablecoin issuers. The fund cements BlackRock’s position as a top reserve manager for stablecoin providers, offering liquidity and GENIUS Act compliance. BlackRock is taking a major step deeper into digital assets, launching a retooled money market fund. According to a CNBC report, the fund is designed for stablecoin issuers as global stablecoin supply surges to an all-time high. Also, the new product, the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund [BSTBL], aims to help issuers manage reserves more efficiently under the GENIUS Act. The landmark U.S. legislation was signed by President Donald Trump months ago and created the country’s first federal framework for stablecoins. BlackRock said the BSTBL fund now offers greater liquidity, expanded trading hours, and full compliance with the new stablecoin standards. The move positions it to become the go-to reserve manager for the next wave of stablecoin providers. BlackRock already oversees Circle’s $64 billion USDC reserve portfolio. It helped push its cash-management business above $1 trillion in assets last quarter. With the updated BSTBL fund, the firm plans to bring the same model to other issuers. Also, it offers secure, yield-bearing exposure to short-term U.S. Treasurys and government securities. Furthermore, the launch comes as the stablecoin supply reaches a record $302.3 billion, according to recent data. Source: X According to CryptoRank, new entrants such as USDe, USD1, and PYUSD are fueling adoption as institutional capital floods in. BlackRock’s pivot reflects how Wall Street is moving from merely investing in crypto to powering its core financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are increasingly used to settle trades, provide collateral, and transfer value across blockchains—functions that demand the kind of liquidity management BlackRock specializes in. With the GENIUS Act’s clarity and its partnership track record, BlackRock is now positioned to capture a large share of that growth. BlackRock’s latest move extends its crypto presence beyond ETFs and tokenized funds like BUIDL. As the stablecoin market breaks new records, BlackRock is no longer just offering exposure to crypto; it’s becoming part of the system’s foundation.

Title: Citizens Sees SharpLink as a Breakout Ether Treasury Play With More Than 200% Upside

Citizens has initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) with a market outperform rating and a $50 price target, implying potential upside of more than 200%, the bank said in a Wednesday report. The shares were 2% higher in early trading, around $15.45. The bank’s bullish stance rests on a positive long-term view of ether’s price trajectory, forecasting ETH above $7,000 by 2026 and potentially exceeding $20,000 by 2030. The report argued that SharpLink has quickly emerged as one of the most ambitious ether ETH$4,001.77 treasury operators in the public markets. After accumulating a substantial ETH position, the company has begun deploying those assets into staking and other yield-bearing strategies designed to compound value over time. The stock is a novel entry point for investors seeking leveraged exposure to Ethereum’s growth, analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote. Rather than functioning as a passive vehicle holding bitcoin BTC$109,359.40 or ether, SharpLink aims to actively manage its ETH balance sheet, issuing equity at a premium to net asset value or buying it back when trading below NAV, and using its ETH reserves to capture on-chain yield opportunities, the analysts wrote. Citizens describes this approach as a "flywheel" that can drive NAV per share higher as the Ethereum ecosystem expands and institutional adoption accelerates. The bank's analysts also assigned a premium valuation to SharpLink based on the company’s leadership and strategy. This includes Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, as Chairman and Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, as Co-CEO, describing the team as ideally positioned to scale a treasury model that blends crypto-native expertise with institutional capital market experience. SharpLink’s strategy positions it to become a market leader as ether matures into a global financial asset, according to Citizens. By combining operational leverage on-chain with financial discipline off-chain, the shares could offer a compelling alternative to traditional digital asset investment vehicles, and one that investors may reward with a valuation premium. SharpLink raised $76.5 million in a direct stock offering priced above market, the company said on Thursday.
