Title: How the Right Is Waging War on Climate-Conscious Investing
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/leonard-leo-consumers-research-esg-climate/683581/

A Leonard Leo–funded effort to destroy ESG has scared off much of corporate America. In January 2020, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock—the world’s largest asset-management firm—released his annual letter to corporate executives. The letters had become something of a tradition: part investor missive, part State of the Union, dispatched each year from the top of the financial world. This one struck a tone of alarm that would reverberate far beyond Wall Street. “Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects,” Fink warned. “We are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.” He said that BlackRock would be “increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress” on sustainability. The message signaled the degree to which a once-obscure investing philosophy known as ESG—short for “environmental, social, and governance”—had become a boardroom priority. For a moment, it looked like corporate America would weigh carbon emissions alongside profits. More major companies soon announced climate goals and promised new standards of accountability. BlackRock helped lead an effort to elect sustainability advocates to the board of ExxonMobil. A consensus seemed to be forming: Business could be a force for good, and markets might even help save the planet. Now, just five years later, that consensus is crumbling. BP is pulling back on a commitment to invest in renewables—and is reportedly expanding plans for drilling. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have scaled back their plastic-reduction pledges. Major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, are hedging their climate bets and investing heavily in fossil-fuel companies. Asset-management firms that joined BlackRock in embracing ESG—including Vanguard and State Street—have also backed off. And Fink’s 2025 letter to investors does not even mention the word climate. James Surowiecki: The hottest trend in investing is mostly a sham “This further exacerbates the problem of slow-walking climate action at a time when the temperature records are being broken and devastating weather events are accelerating,” Richard Brooks, the climate finance director for Stand.earth, an international environmental-advocacy organization that focuses in part on corporate contributions to climate change, told us. This global retreat has been particularly acute in the United States, where political resistance to ESG has grown into an organized countermovement. The issue is now a fixture in partisan attack ads, Republican statehouse legislation, and right-wing media. The forces arrayed against ESG say they are just getting started. In January, a group of present and former Republican state officials gathered at a posh resort in Sea Island, Georgia, together with conservative leaders, for a two-day lesson in how to dismantle corporate America’s most ambitious response to climate change. At the Cloister, with its golf courses, tennis courts, and beaches, ESG was denounced as a sinister force undermining free markets and democracy. “I would hope everyone here is pretty much committed to destroying ESG,” said Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, the organization that has led the fight. His group, he said, had spent $5 million running ads “educating consumers” about the dangers of ESG. Hild spread a similar message at other events this spring, according to transcripts of his remarks that we obtained. “ESG is when they use their market share to push a far-left agenda, without ever having to go to voters, without any electoral accountability,” said Hild at a March meeting of state activists. “This is not the free market operating. This is a cartel. This is a mafia.” At its core, ESG investing means integrating nonfinancial factors—such as climate risk, carbon emissions, pollution, and corporate governance—into investment decisions, with the idea that these issues could materially affect long-term performance. Firms that offer ESG funds screen out companies that don’t meet a set of criteria for climate protection, and pitch their products to investors as climate-friendly alternatives to conventional funds. But in the eyes of its critics, ESG investing undermines democratic governance, imposes political priorities through the financial system, and breaches the independence of state financial officers to seek maximum return on investments. “By applying arbitrary ESG financial metrics that serve no one except the companies that created them, elites are circumventing the ballot box to implement a radical ideological agenda,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in 2023 when he introduced legislation prohibiting the use of ESG investment by Florida pension and other state funds. That narrative has taken hold with a wide swath of Republican leaders. Donald Trump attacked ESG on the campaign trail last year, and in an April 8 executive order, the president said that state-level climate-emissions and ESG laws “are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy. They should not stand.” The roots of ESG can be traced to faith-based investing of the 18th century, when some religious denominations sought to avoid investment in corporations that promoted trading enslaved people. In the 20th century, the movement called “socially responsible investing” gained momentum during the civil-rights era and, later, in connection with opposition to apartheid in South Africa. The term ESG was formally coined in a 2004 report by the United Nations Global Compact titled “Who Cares Wins,” which argued that better corporate integration of environmental, social, and governance factors could lead to more-sustainable markets and better outcomes around the globe. ESG investing grew in the 2010s as the public grew more concerned about diversity, the environment, and executive pay. Major asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street began offering ESG products, and companies competed to establish metrics to track compliance. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock played an especially influential role. Because there was no single established metric for meeting climate goals, critics on the left complained that ESG encouraged greenwashing, in which companies claim to be making environmental progress without making an actual commitment. But even critics were forced to concede that ESG brought about increased transparency. In 2018, 34 percent of publicly traded global companies disclosed greenhouse-gas-emission details. By 2023, that share had risen to 63 percent, an increase generally attributable to ESG efforts, according to R. Paul Herman, the founder and CEO of HIP Investor Inc. Although many asset managers noted the difficulties of measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, they embraced ESG as part of their long-term management strategy—and trillions of dollars flowed to them. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG-fund assets reached around $30 trillion in 2022. The analytics firm forecast in February 2024 that global ESG assets would surpass $40 trillion by 2030. Expectations for ESG have now fallen off dramatically—and Hild and his three colleagues at Consumers’ Research can claim much of the credit. At seminars such as the one at Sea Island, Hild and his allies armed a network of Republican state attorneys general, state treasurers, and comptrollers with legal and political ammunition. The key funders of such efforts include fossil-fuel-industry executives and Leonard Leo, who is best known for his leadership of the Federalist Society. In recent years, Leo has moved beyond his focus on transforming America’s courts, vowing in videotaped remarks in 2023 to take on “wokeism in the corporate environment, in the educational environment,” biased media, and “entertainment that is really corrupting our youth.” Beginning in 2021, Leo and his team injected cash into a long-dormant organization that they would use to fight ESG: Consumers’ Research. A spokesperson for Leo told us that “woke companies are defrauding their consumers and poisoning our culture, and Leonard Leo is proud to support Will Hild and Consumers’ Research as they crush liberal dominance in those woke companies and hold them accountable.” The organization found a receptive audience among Republican state officials eager for a road map to combatting ESG. The group emphasized using leverage that states possess through their management of pension funds to punish investment firms that had signed on to boycott oil and gas companies. Zoë Schlanger: The climate can’t afford another Trump presidency Republican attorneys general from a few fossil-fuel-dependent states, such as Texas and West Virginia, began in 2021 to investigate whether investments tied to ESG guidelines violated state laws. They sent letters of inquiry to major firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard, questioning whether their ESG practices were legally compatible with states’ fiduciary obligations, especially concerning pension funds. That same year, Texas enacted Senate Bill 13, which requires state pension systems and other state endowments to divest from financial institutions seen as hostile to the oil and gas industry. Under that law, the state attorney general’s office placed more than 370 investment firms on a blacklist—including BlackRock and several divisions of major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The following year, the offensive intensified. A coalition of 19 Republican attorneys general sent a joint letter to Fink, the BlackRock CEO, accusing the company of putting climate goals ahead of financial returns and pressuring corporations to align with international climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement. “BlackRock appears to use the hard-earned money of our states’ citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment,” the letter warned. It cited proxy-voting strategies and coordination with groups such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative as potential legal overreach. Since 2022, 23 Republican state attorneys general have opened investigations into ESG-focused investment firms. Several of those officials had help from an Arizona-based private firm, Fusion Law, which received $4.5 million from Consumers’ Research in its first two years of existence. One of the firm’s founders, Paul Watkins, is a former Arizona civil-litigation chief in the state’s attorney general’s office—and was also a legal fellow at Consumers’ Research. “Paul Watkins and Fusion Law have been essential in helping to unravel and document the inner workings of ESG,” Hild told us. The firm has had contracts to work on ESG-related issues with attorneys general in Tennessee and Utah. Watkins has been a featured speaker at Consumers’ Research events, including the gathering in January. Recently, state-level investigators began probing the question of whether environmental groups, asset managers, and shareholder-advocacy organizations were engaged in collusion, using ESG to restrain trade in fossil-fuel companies, in violation of antitrust laws. The opposition of red-state officials has chilled discussion of sustainable investments at institutional-investor meetings, according to participants, despite accusations of hypocrisy from Democratic officials in blue states. Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, told us that Republicans are distorting investment decisions by putting their thumb on the scale against ESG. “These are people who once upon a time believed in free markets,” Lander, a Democrat, told us. “I’m not telling anyone how to invest. I just don’t want them to tell me.” Evidence suggests that the Republican push has been costly to taxpayers. A study by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business found that the Texas law banning municipalities from doing business with banks that have ESG policies reduced the competition for borrowing—and generated a potential cost of up to $532 million in extra interest per year. Nonetheless, the anti-ESG movement is spreading: What began largely as a state-level attack has now blossomed on Capitol Hill. In mid-2023, House Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, launched a wide-ranging probe into ESG practices. More than 60 entities, including environmental groups, corporations, and financial institutions, were asked to provide information on alleged coordination aimed at limiting fossil-fuel investment. The committee’s interim staff report, released last year, accused ESG advocates of forming a “climate cartel” that sought to “impose left-wing environmental, social, and governance goals” through coordinated pressure campaigns. The report alleged that such efforts amounted to collusion in restraint of trade. During his inquiry, Jordan issued waves of subpoenas targeting organizations such as Ceres, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and the shareholder-advocacy nonprofit As You Sow. Targets of the inquiry were required to turn over more than 100,000 pages of email and other communications as the committee investigated allegations of antitrust violations and collusion in recommending sustainable-investment options. “The investigation was abusive, and it was chilling,” said Danielle Fugere, the president and chief counsel of As You Sow, who testified for more than eight hours before Jordan’s panel last year. “You cannot defy the reality of climate change and the scientific imperative of acting,” said Mindy Lubber, the president and CEO of the pro-sustainability nonprofit group Ceres, which has been active in prodding companies into taking part in ESG measures. But, she said, “everybody is afraid of the bull’s-eyes on their backs.” Annie Lowrey: If you’re worried about the climate, move your money Jordan’s inquiry is continuing this year, with a focus on possible antitrust violations by environmental organizations and asset managers and advisors. The pressure is working as intended. After Jordan launched his inquiry, many high-profile firms exited the Climate Action 100+ initiative. Coalitions of financial institutions that once committed to sustainable investing have collapsed. Several U.S. banks—including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—withdrew from an influential bankers’ climate coalition, citing legal risk and political pressure. BlackRock and Vanguard pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, leading that group to halt operations. “Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the company said in a letter to clients. “BlackRock’s active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” The company, which declined our request to interview Fink, referred us to other official statements including one noting that “BlackRock’s sustainable and transition investing platform is driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets.” Other asset managers issued similar statements, noting that they would still offer green-investment options. But interest in ESG funds has declined substantially. U.S. investment funds specializing in climate experienced net inflows of $70 billion in 2021—but by 2023, the tide had reversed, with money flowing out of the funds faster than it was coming in. Last year, net outflows amounted to $19.6 billion, with the trend continuing into the first quarter of 2025, according to Morningstar Analytics. Proxy initiatives from shareholders interested in sustainable investing have also declined, another casualty of the war against ESG. “This has been a silent spring,” William Patterson, a former director for investment for the AFL-CIO who tracks climate-related shareholder action, told us. “Investor initiatives on climate, which attained broad shareholder support in the past, are barely present” at investor meetings this year. Meanwhile, the number of anti-ESG proxy proposals more than quadrupled from 2021 to 2024. As of February, a fifth of all shareholder proposals submitted were filed by anti-ESG groups. Despite the precipitous decline of ESG investing, its detractors are not ready to declare victory. Consumers’ Research, for one, is committed to pressing on. “ESG is in retreat, but it is not defeated yet,” Hild told us. “We have a long way to go before people get rid of it.” Proponents are not relenting either, and are looking forward to a moment when the political winds shift once more. “What I hear, especially in the U.S., is twofold,” said Daniel Klier, the chief executive of the advisory firm South Pole. “One message is ‘Keep your head down,’ but also that climate change will not go away—and we need to prepare for the decades to come and not just in the next four years.”

Title: America’s Worst Polluters See a Lifeline in Power-Gobbling AI—and Donald Trump

President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House on July 15, 2025, in Washington, as Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt watches in reverence.. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP This story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants, and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Title: BlackRock files with SEC to add staking in Ethereum ETF – Details here!

ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management. Nasdaq submitted an updated filing to the SEC to add staking to the iShares Ethereum Trust issued by BlackRock. This came after ETHA saw $499 million in daily inflows, but the price of ETH has not moved much in recent hours. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the 17th of July, BlackRock is looking to upgrade its iShares Ethereum Trust [ETHA] to include staking. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq “to permit staking of ether held by the Trust”. Nasdaq and BlackRock were not the first ETF issuers to push to update their Ethereum spot ETF to include the option for staking. In March, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) group and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) proposed adding ETH staking to Fidelity, Franklin, and Bitwise ETFs. Rival issuers 21Shares and Grayscale have also previously submitted such proposals. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management and saw a $499 million inflow on the 16th of July. Speaking on the topic, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart clarified that staking was “not yet done“. He said, “Staking is not “done”. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October.” Seyffart added, “The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25)”. Vance Spencer, co-founder of crypto-native investment firm Framework Ventures, commented on X: “Maybe you didn’t expect Lubin and Tom Lee to lead the TradFi bandwagon to ETH, and BlackRock to add staking just as the wheels start to turn. But that’s what’s happening. There’s no need to be upset.” Spencer referred to Joe Lubin and Tom Lee in his post. Lubin is the chairman of SharpLink Gaming, and Lee is a top Wall Street strategist and Head of Research at Fundstrat. SharpLink [SBET] has the largest ETH reserves, surpassing even the Ethereum Foundation. It was reported that SharpLink would offer up to $5 billion of common stock to acquire more ETH. Spencer’s post highlights TradFi’s growing interest in Ethereum. He pointed to BlackRock’s move to add staking to its ETH ETF. This signals rising institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. Spencer suggested the shift is already underway, and there’s no reason to be upset. The price of Ethereum [ETH] has not reacted much since the news came out. The past two hours of trading before the time of writing saw ETH fall 0.53% to $3,409. However, the leading altcoin has outperformed the industry giant Bitcoin [BTC] and its competing Layer 1 altcoin Solana [SOL] comfortably over the past week.

Title: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After beating the resistance mounted at the $3,000 by bears for months now, the Ethereum price looks primed for a further breakout. Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge. The post highlights the fact that Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways. However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Data from the Farside website shows that Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive net flows for almost two weeks straight now. The likes of BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge with tens of thousands of ETH being bought up daily. Ethereum treasury companies are now the rave of the moment as the likes of SharpLink and BitMine begin accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH. This rise in institutional adoption has become one of the major pushes for Ethereum as investors clamor for new highs.

Title: Remove statute of limitations to encourage churches and orders to pay sex-abuse redress - expert
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/07/18/remove-statute-of-limitations-to-encourage-churches-and-orders-to-pay-sex-abuse-redress-expert/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T05:00:00Z

In November 2022, when a tsunami of sexual abuse allegations swept into the public domain following the broadcast of the RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys, much of the focus was on abuse in Irish schools run by some of the religious orders. However, allegations soon emerged about similar abuse in primary and secondary schools run by the Catholic and Protestant Churches. On many grounds, not least moral, they would appear to be as obliged as the State and religious orders when it comes to contributing to compensation for people abused in their schools. Traditionally, the Irish education system has been run by the churches. Currently, 88 per cent of primary schools in Ireland are Catholic, with 5.7 per cent linked to the Church of Ireland. At second level, of 717 of 722 post-primary schools are run in association with the main churches – 338 have a Catholic ethos, 21 are Church of Ireland, 211 are multi-denominational and 147 are inter-denominational. Of the remaining five, two are Quaker-run, while Presbyterians, Methodists and Jews run one each. All schools come within the remit of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee earlier this month. Based on previous inquiries and convictions in the courts, it is known there was sexual abuse in schools other than those run by religious congregations. Yet, recent discussion around redress seems focused entirely on contributions made, or not, by religious orders, which have been found wanting. For instance, all four religious orders involved in running Magdalene laundries refused to contribute to a redress scheme for women who spent time in those institutions. Of the eight religious congregations involved in running the Mother and Baby Homes, just two have agreed to contribute to redress for survivors. Of the approximate €1.5 billion paid to survivors of residential institutions for children, about 16 per cent has come from the 18 religious congregations that ran them. According to Department of Education figures, the total adjusted offers towards redress from those orders amounted to €435.53 million, with €245.24 million realised. Even the controversial 2002 “indemnity deal" entered into by the 18 religious congregation has not been fulfilled. Two properties have yet to be transferred, with €124.94 million of the €128 million pledged under the deal realised so far. Prof Conor O’Mahony, director of the Child Law Clinic at UCC, said one possible way of encouraging the orders and the churches to contribute to a redress scheme would be to remove a statute of limitations on survivors taking legal actions against them. “Then it would be in their interest to contribute to a redress scheme, as a way of reducing overall costs.” O’Mahony noted, however, that under Article 44 of the Constitution, the orders are entitled to hold on to their property. Where the State is concerned, and repeating what he wrote in this newspaper following publication of the scoping inquiry report last September, he said “survivors, solicitors, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Child Law Clinic in UCC have spent a decade battling the Department of Education, seeking the full implementation of the O’Keeffe judgment, but this has yet to happen". Louise O’Keeffe was aged eight when she was abused at Dunderrow National School in Cork in 1973 by principal Leo Hickey. Complaints had been made against him but, in line with Department of Education policy then, these were directed to the local priest. Hickey remained at the school, perpetrating more than 400 counts of abuse against at least 20 victims. Following further allegations, he resigned and moved to another school, where he taught for a further 22 years until his retirement in 1995. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to 21 sample charges relating to the sexual abuse of girls under his care and was sentenced to three years in prison. O’Keeffe took legal action for damages, but the courts ruled the department was not liable because the school was under Catholic Church management, even though the State paid Hickey’s salary. She appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2014 found Ireland had failed to protect O’Keeffe from Hickey while at school. It said the State, when relinquishing control of education, should have been aware of the potential risks and put in place safeguards given its obligation to protect children. By failing to put in place adequate child-protection measures until the early 1990s at primary and second level, O’Mahony said the court found “the Irish State had a stand-alone culpability for breach of convention rights, independent of any other actor”. “The Irish government interpreted the ruling as meaning it was only liable for damages in cases where there had been a prior complaint against an abuser,” he said. O’Mahony said that while O’Keeffe was awarded damages, it was unfortunate that the scheme was “designed from its inception to make it almost impossible to receive compensation”. “Only one-third of the budget of €31 million allocated to the scheme was paid out. Most of the people abused by the same teacher as Louise O’Keeffe [was] would not have qualified for payments under the scheme – which demonstrates the bizarre logic at work,” he said. “Very simply, the 2014 O’Keeffe judgment demands that every child who experienced sexual abuse in a defective child protection framework in schools be compensated for that abuse. The Government needs to match words with action for the first time on this matter.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: All-Ireland hurling final: Joe Canning’s Cork player profiles
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2025/07/18/all-ireland-hurling-final-joe-cannings-cork-player-profiles/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Age: 28 Club: Ballinhassig Debut: v Limerick, 2021 His long puckouts to Brian Hayes are a key weapon for Cork, but Collins is good at medium-range deliveries too and his puckouts to Tim O’Mahony were particularly impressive in the semi-final. In some situations, like for Limerick’s goal in the Munster final, he needs to stay on his feet longer. Age: 27 Club: Castlelyons Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 O’Leary is a no-fuss kind of player: tight and tough. I don’t think Cork will worry about match-ups in their full-back line. O’Leary loves a one-on-one battle and he’ll be trusted to pick up whoever comes into his corner. One of Cork’s best players in the league, he has carried that form into the championship. Age: 22 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 For many years after Diarmuid O’Sullivan retired, number three has been a problem for Cork. Downey has nailed down the position now. Occasionally he looks vulnerable in the air, but I don’t think it’s a weakness. He had a brilliant final last year, but John McGrath’s movement and intelligence will ask some questions. Age: 29 Club: Inniscarra Debut: v Clare, 2018 Lost the captaincy at the beginning of the year and it looked like he might be under pressure to hold his place. However, O’Donoghue has been brilliant this season. Marked Darragh McCarthy in the league final and was lined up to mark him again in the championship until McCarthy was sent off in the first minute. Age: 23 Club: Castlemartyr Debut: v Limerick, 2022 Even though he likes to do a bit of hurling, Joyce is Cork’s go-to man marker in the half-back line. I expect him to tag Jake Morris and the outcome of that duel will have an impact on the result. Has also done well at centre back during the championship when Robert Downey was injured. Age: 25 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Limerick, 2019 Has had an injury-interrupted season but made an impact off the bench in the Munster final and was commanding against Dublin, especially under the high ball. Andrew Ormond will pose a different test this weekend and I think Tipp will target Downey’s channel with pace. Age: 27 Club: Blarney Debut: v Wexford, 2016 Had a good final last year and his overall form this season is much better than last year. Very good going forward and delivers quick ball into his forwards, but not as effective going towards his own goal. Sam O’Farrell will have defensive duties in his own half, though, and that will suit Coleman. Age: 28 Club: Newtownshandrum Debut: v Clare, 2018 O’Mahony is the engine of the team and when he’s going well Cork seem to go well. When he didn’t have an influence against Limerick in the round-robin game, Cork had no foothold in the middle third. He’s been outstanding in the last two games, returning to the form he showed in the league. Age: 28 Club: Charleville Debut: v Tipperary, 2017 Cork played him at centre forward for a lot of the year, but I think centre field is his best position. O’Mahony’s capacity to break up the play makes him a perfect foil and gives Fitzgibbon the freedom to attack. Had a huge game in the Munster final when Cork really needed their leaders to stand up. Age: 21 Club: Lisgoold Debut: v Clare, 2025 Did exceptionally well in the Munster final and though he’s a young player in his rookie season, there seems to be no question about his temperament. Had a quieter game against Dublin in the semi-final, but he has a very bright future. Tall, athletic, rangy with a good eye for a score. Age: 24 Club: Blarney Debut: v Dublin, 2020 Was one of the favourites for Hurler of the Year going into last year’s All-Ireland and came back to that kind of form against Limerick in the Munster final. His shooting was off against Dublin, but even on a day like that he’s always busy and asking questions. Will force Tipp to think about their options at number six. Age: 27 Club: Fr O’Neill’s Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 After a frustrating year with injuries, he came storming back to form in the semi-final against Dublin. He also had a hugely effective semi-final last year but failed to back it up against Clare. That experience will stand to him. Takes the pressure off Patrick Horgan with long-range frees. Age: 37 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary 2008 Deserves to win an All-Ireland and maybe it will finally come on Sunday. Cork don’t depend on him nearly as much as they have over the years, which is better for everyone. Has not hit his usual percentages with dead balls but still good for a couple of scores from play. Age: 24 Club: Blackrock Debut: v Limerick, 2021 Had a spectacular match against Dublin but he doesn’t always deliver. He strikes me as a confidence player who needs the first couple of possessions to go well. If that happens, he could be electric. Always thinking about a goal and has scored five against Tipp in his last three games against them. Age: 24 Club: St Finbarr’s Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 With the biggest game of the year left, he’s my Hurler of the Year. Everything goes through him in the Cork attack, whether it’s a long puckout or a ball sent in from the middle third. His improvement over the last 14 months has been phenomenal and nothing seems to phase him. With Séamus Harnedy not fit to start, he’s a huge option to come on. As well as him, they have plenty of experience on the bench: Shane Kingston, Conor Lehane and Damien Cahalane have all been around a long time. Pat Ryan (Manager) Donal O’Rourke, Brendan Coleman, Fergal Condon, Donal O’Mahony Pat Ryan has never looked for excuses on Cork’s bad days and he’s never blamed the players. That’s a great trait in a manager and the players will appreciate that. The way he has handled himself and the team has been hugely impressive.

Title: Crypto’s Wild West Era Is Over

For more than a decade, cryptocurrency lived in a regulatory gray zone. Loved by libertarians, feared by bankers, and mocked by lawmakers, it was treated like a side project of the internet, too weird to regulate and too volatile to embrace. That era just ended. The U.S. House of Representatives has officially passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that sets federal rules for stablecoinsâthe digital currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump, making it the first major piece of crypto legislation in American history. It is the moment crypto has been waiting for: real rules, real recognition, and real legitimacy. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are already used to move billions of dollars every day. They’re the quiet workhorses of cryptoâused to send money across borders, trade on crypto exchanges, and settle payments instantly without touching a traditional bank. But until now, there were no federal laws clearly defining how they should work, what they must be backed by, or who should regulate them. That uncertainty scared away banks, blocked innovation, and left consumers vulnerable. The GENIUS Act changes that. It requires stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves in cash or U.S. Treasury bills. It enforces monthly disclosures. It gives consumers priority if an issuer goes bankrupt. It creates a path for both federal and state-level oversight. In short, it gives crypto the kind of legal foundation that big institutionsâand average Americansâcan finally trust. This law isnât just about taming crypto. Itâs about launching the next era of American finance. Stablecoins are already powering instant global payments. In the future, they could be integrated into everyday appsâused to pay rent, send money to family, or settle business transactions in seconds. With the GENIUS Act, the U.S. is staking a claim to lead that future. At a time when countries like China are racing to launch their own state-backed digital currencies, this law sends a clear message: America wonât be left behind. It also opens the door for crypto to leave the speculative Wild West and move into the financial mainstream. Companies like PayPal, Visa, and BlackRock are already building on blockchain rails. Now, they can do it with a legal framework behind them. For years, crypto has been dismissed as a sideshow. Critics called it a scam, a bubble, or a toy for rich tech bros. There was some truth to the chaos. But behind the scenes, a new financial infrastructure was being built: faster, programmable, and radically transparent. With this new law, that infrastructure gets its first real seal of approval from Washington. Itâs not just about price anymore. Itâs about permanence. The GENIUS Act is just the beginning. More legislation is coming, covering digital asset securities, smart contract standards, and decentralized platforms. But this bill proves Congress can act. That alone is a major shift in the political landscape. In the next few years, you may not even realize youâre using crypto. It will just be how money moves: instantly, digitally, securely. And legally. Crypto is no longer knocking on the door. Itâs walking in. Bitcoinpolicyregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30âbut the rules are murky, and the government hasnât said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The worldâs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally. As Brussels moves to regulate AI, the Trump administration is retaliating with steep tariffs, pushing the two powers closer to an all-out trade war that could reshape the global internet. Fueled by Trumpâs pressure on the Fed and a tidal wave of investor optimism, the worldâs most famous cryptocurrency is on an unstoppable run.

Title: If Mamdani Sinks the Democrats, So What?

What’s wrong with New Yorkers electing Zohran Mamdani mayor? Seriously. He’s a socialist, isn’t he? He’ll wreck New York City, you say. But didn’t that process start with Bill DeBlasio? Do you think that process ends electing Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams? Perennial candidate Curtis Silwa is a savior? Hasn’t socialism been the road Democrats have been traveling for decades? When Mamdani’s socialist experiment crashes and burns, maybe it’ll persuade New Yorkers to abandon Democrats. Maybe independents decide to swing Republican. JFK-style liberals began vanishing after Kennedy’s assassination. Mamdani’s election would make it obvious what should be obvious. Liberalism, progressivism -- call it whatever -- is a ruse. The Democrat Party tilts full Left. Trends are making it more so. Mamdani will pursue an agenda that’s part utopian drivel, Soviet-style top-down, and plenty of Cuban incompetence leading to dysfunctional public services, higher costs, and increasing scarcity. Dead Russians and living Cubans can testify to what glorious utopia brings. A broken Democrat Party is a public necessity. Big failure means bigger brokenness. Let’s not hear nonsense from “good government” Republicans that a healthy two-party system profits the nation. Life isn’t a civics class. Franklin Roosevelt didn’t give a damn about anything other than healthy Democrat dominance. Jacksonian Democrats and Lincoln and McKinley Republicans believed no differently. When did Republicans go softheaded? Let dogmatic Democrats stumble in the wilderness for a generation or more. A Trumpian sea change completes in two ways: the president keeps racking up Ws and Democrats continue to misgovern, driven by extreme policies. (Senator Dave McCormick’s energy and AI summit held at Carnegie Mellon University this past week showcased more huge wins for the president. Colossal benefits are expected for the economy, regionally and nationally.) A busted Democrat party isn’t just about narrow partisan advantage. Clearing out Democrats is pivotal. MAGA is about the nation returning to its core values… about building a freer, more prosperous America. Smarter Democrat operatives see their party teetering. From The Hill, July 14: “Sadly, Democrats are still stuck in the same mud that they were in six months ago,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. “We are still as unpopular as we were when Trump was inaugurated in January.” An unnamed strategist went further, stating: “This is a nightmare scenario for the Dems right now,” the strategist said. “We better pray long and hard that the country is going to be in a fâââing depression, because I don’t know how else we find ourselves out of this mess.” Mamdani is running mask off. Give the guy credit. Indoctrinated young left-wingers proclaim socialism is the future. How many times before have we heard that? Plenty of these cultists live in the Big Apple. Posted former college professor Newt Gingrich at X, July 15: Mamdani’s supporters are not the well educated young the media describes. They are the well brainwashed young. The more elite the school you went to the more likely you are to be brainwashed rather than educated. They could vote for Mamdani to turn New York City into Caracas and they would have no idea how much damage they will have done. As Mark Twain said “It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.” Welcome to Mandani land[.] Newt, these young are social inbreds. Their parents’ money has insulated them from life’s grittier realities. U.S. history has been spoon-fed to them by radical leftist teachers and professors. America is evil. Light-lift liberal arts degrees from high-dollar universities impart the illusion of being elite on merit. Ivy League alumni take care of each other. Life in Manhattan and Brooklyn -- NYC’s priciest boroughs -- is easier with mommy’s and daddy’s credit cards handy. Entry-level jobs are for public college grunges. The newer brand of Democrats are stepping off college campuses as bold radicals. Consider the life issue. Not long ago, pro-abortion advocates went to great pains to call themselves pro-choice. Now, most of them proclaim that they’re pro-abortion. Killing a baby in the womb up to birth has acquired trophy status. Women must be empowered, they shout. Sleeping around and career fulfillment rank higher than a baby’s life. We’re only now seeing the consequences to older women who bought the tripe. They’re spouseless and childless. Do cats and chardonnay fill voids? Mamdani’s platform is pretty darn red. The redder the platform, the greater the disaster in the offing. That’s good because an epic implosion is needed. The platform is packed with the same garbage that “progressives” peddle in Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Austin, and Los Angeles -- six cities that are in various stages of ruin. DEI and woke twaddle and more carveouts for 3% of the population that’s drowning in the delusion called “LGBTQIA+” are platform worthy. Any room for better policing along the lines of Giuliani’s and Bloomberg’s highly effective broken windows policies? Nope. Instead, criminals require intervention and therapy. Mamdani proposes a “Department of Community Safety,” which other blue cities mirror in some fashion. New Yorkers, if you think crime is bad now, just wait. Mamdani means to enact an all-in, go-for-broke socialism in the Big Apple. Remarked ex-congressman Dean Phillips (D-MN) on CNN, July10: “Anyone who talks about seizing the means of production or opening government-run grocery stores is at great odds with most of the country[.]” That’s an affirmative, Dean. That may be why New York’s business movers-and-shakers skipped a meet-and-greet with Mamdani. As Charles Gasparino reported, New York Post, July 15: The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the [NYC] Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nation’s largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nation’s second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Gasparino continued: Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Mamdani vows to hike taxes on “corporations and the 1%.” Wait for the deafening sound of money rushing out of NYC next year. Governors Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis must be licking their chops. FBI deputy director Dan Bongino -- a native New Yorker -- has said that things won’t change for the better in New York until things get worse. Electing Mamdani would be worse. The Big Apple is headed for a helluva a rough ride if polls are true. That’s too bad for New Yorkers who have no easy exit. But Mamdani’s election and the city’s subsequent fall will provide a searing lesson for voters everywhere. Not only is socialism a pox, but Democrats are the carriers. Mamdani’s election might spark a chain reaction. Blue state and city elected leaders will probably try to out-socialist Mamdani. Then, as havoc spreads, watch the out-migrations accelerate. People will be tripping over themselves to flee dysfunctional communities. Let’s hope that migrants leave their politics behind. Whatever. Independent voters matter more. Working folk and middle-class wage-earners are in tune with Trump’s policies. Hispanics increasingly so. And some blacks. Democrats, mired in the La Brea Tar Pits of socialist dogma, and mucking up everything, coupled with more Trump victories, are the recipe for a new majority dedicated to -- you guessed it -- making America great again. About the Big Apple, Frank Sinatra once crooned, “If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere. It's up to you, New York, New York.” It certainly is up to you, New York, New York. More about how you survive Mamdani. Good luck with that. J. Robert Smith can be found at X. His handle is @JRobertSmith1. At Gab, @JRobertSmith. He blogs occasionally at Flyover.

Title: Anti-DEI Shareholder Proposals Are Failing, But Not Because Of Politics
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/07/17/anti-dei-shareholder-proposals-are-failing-but-not-because-of-politics/

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order to appoint Chris ... More Rocheleau as the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump also signed a memorandum ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety and ordering an elevation of what he called “competence” over “D.E.I.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Shareholders are overwhelmingly voting down proposals to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at top companies. The rejection of anti-DEI proposals is emboldening advocates who view it as a clear statement by investors that they are rejecting conservative policies and as an admonishment of President Trump. However, the rejections were not about politics, rather about the process and nature of the shareholder votes. Simply, the proposals were doomed to fail. Republicans in the U.S. have taken a strong stance against DEI programs, calling them discriminatory. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Justice has made it clear they view DEI programs as illegal and will be using the office to prosecute violators, stating the “Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division will investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector…” This creates a clear threat of legal liability against companies wishing to engage in DEI practices. Conservative groups are also taking the issue directly to companies During the 2025 proxy season, the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, submitted the majority of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals in 2025. The proposals referenced a series of cases, including Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that ruled race-based admissions are unconstitutional. As I noted in 2023, the Court’s opinion was a major blow to ESG and DEI, even though it did not directly address those issues in the corporate world. Other cases and the actions by the DOJ are connecting DEI as illegal discrimination. While there may be legal merits to some of NCPPR’s arguments, the format of the shareholder proposal made passage nearly impossible. This has caused confusion as to the intent of corporate management versus their actions, causing activists to find false hope. However, a look at the type of proposals provides needed context. Proposals submitted to the shareholders for approval come in the form of management proposals and shareholder proposals. Management proposals originate from the board of directors of the company. They have been vetted and worked through a clear process. As a result, those tend to have a high passage rate. Shareholder proposals originate from individuals or organizations that own shares in the company. Each company has its own process for how a shareholder can introduce a proposal for approval by the shareholders. Typically, shareholder proposals are only a small fraction of the total proposals. Shareholder proposals also have a much lower passage rate. According a BlackRock report, only 867 shareholder proposals were voted on in the 2023 - 2024 proxy year, compared to 168,400 management proposals. During that year, BlackRock only voted in favor of 99 of the shareholder proposals, approximately 11.4% of them. This has been consistent as BlackRock states they generally follow management for the direction of a company, while shareholder proposals tend to be in conflict with management proposals. A study by Cooley of the 2025 proxy season showed similar results, stating that 3000 companies received 830 shareholder proposals in the 2025 proxy year. Looking at overall support, not passage rate, shareholder proposals relating to governance issues only received 35% support, environmental proposals received 13% support, and social proposals received 12% support. No DEI proposals passed, either in support or in opposition of the programs. The lack of support for shareholder proposals is institutional and driven by the large financial management companies, like BlackRock, that tend to support management proposals at a much higher rate, while overwhelming rejecting shareholder proposals. This has led to confusion of policies as people attach meaning to the vote that is not tied to the stated rationale. This misunderstanding of the shareholder proposal votes is not new. I wrote about this issue in August 2024, when BlackRock was accused of pulling support of ESG. The accusations were based on BlackRock’s votes against shareholder proposals that called for a larger focus on ESG. In BlackRock’s 2024 Global Voting Spotlight, released in August 2024, the company stated “our analysis indicates that a relatively small number of shareholder proponents and advocacy groups filed the majority of proposals at U.S.-based companies – with fewer than 10 filing approximately 80% of proposals in the 2023-24 proxy year. Based on our review of proxy materials, these proponents often filed similar proposals at multiple companies, regardless of the specifics of their sectors or business models.” The BlackRock report also stated, “we still observed many poor-quality proposals come to a vote, particularly on proposals that attempted to address climate and natural capital or company impacts on people-related issues. Consistent with last year, we found the majority of proposals addressing these topics were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value. A significant percentage were focused on business risks that companies already had processes in place to address, making them redundant.” The same rationale was offered in opposition of the anti-DEI proposals. In response to a proposal made to Apply by NCPPR, management stated the proposal “is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program. The proposal also inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.” Dick’s Sporting Goods offered a similar response, stating “we already have well established compliance and risk oversight programs and processes…” Others used similar language. The argument by management is simply that this is an issue that should not be adopted by shareholders. Instead, it is a risk and compliance issue that should be addressed by management. As the legal landscape changes, the company needs to be able to adapt without the confines of a shareholder vote. While DEI advocates will use the failure of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals as a sign that the tide is shifting against Trump, the data shows that is is just business as usual.

Title: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit Record $726M—BlackRock Alone Drew $500M

Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have just seen their biggest day of inflows, driven largely by demand on BlackRock and Fidelity. According to data from Farside Investors, July 16th was a big day for the US Ethereum spot ETFs, with total inflows crossing the $726 million mark, a new all-time high (ATH). The spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this means that ETF holders don’t have to manage digital asset wallets or navigate exchanges. For traditional investors, this fact can make spot ETFs a convenient way to explore the market. Ethereum spot ETFs gained approval in the US nearly one year ago. Since then, demand has varied, but the asset has lately been on a positive run of inflows, with the most recent numbers showing momentum is only accelerating. Below is a table that shows how the netflow related to the various Ethereum spot ETFs has looked during the last couple of weeks. As is visible, notable daily inflows of around $200 million or more were already happening into the US Ethereum spot ETFs during the past week, indicating that demand from institutional entities was solid, but with the latest record-breaking day, things have clearly kicked into an even higher gear. BlackRock’s ETHA saw the largest share of July 16th inflows at almost $500 million. Fidelity’s FETH was a distant second, purchasing about $133 million in the cryptocurrency on behalf of its users.Capital has poured into the spot ETFs as Ethereum has seen a breakout above the $3,000 level, which has so far brought it to $3,400 for the first time since January. Following this rally, institutional investors aren’t the only ones paying attention to ETH, as data from the analytics firm Santiment shows a spike in retail interest. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the Social Dominance, an indicator that tells us about the discussion share that Ethereum occupies on the major social media platforms relative to other cryptocurrencies. Since retail investors far outweigh the larger holders in terms of numbers, this metric ends up reflecting the behavior of the small hands. From the graph, it’s apparent that the ETH Social Dominance has seen a huge spike alongside the price surge, with 13.4% of all digital asset discussions on social media now involving the coin. Clearly, retail is taking note of the asset now, but historically, overhype among the crowd is something that has tended not to end well for cryptocurrencies, so this trend could be one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,400, up more than 23% over the last week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

In this column, JWR also covers hedges, derivatives, and various obscura. This column emphasizes JWR’s “tangibles heavy” investing strategy and contrarian perspective. Today, we look at the LMBA’s nascent silver short squeeze. (See the Precious Metals section.) The Comex shorts did their best to hold down the price of silver again this week. But the Asian traders kept bidding it back up into the $38.20 to $38.50 USD range. The word is out that the LBMA has nearly exhausted its supply of physically warehoused silver available for delivery. The exchange now holds less than 160 million physical ounces. Keep in mind that more than 200 million ounces worth of silver contracts are cleared there, daily. But most of those are “paper for paper” transactions — not physical deliveries. What happens if and when more buyers start to demand delivery? This could get ugly. (For the Shorts, that is. Not for us silver stackers.

Title: Trump Prepares To Allow Crypto Investments In $9 Trillion Retirement Market

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to open the $9 trillion retirement market to a range of alternative investments, including crypto, gold, and private equity. According to the Financial Times, this initiative is expected to be formalized through an executive order as early as this week. It seeks to diversify the investment options available within 401(k) plans, which have traditionally been limited to stocks and bonds. Trump’s forthcoming executive order will direct regulatory agencies to explore the necessary adjustments to facilitate the inclusion of these alternative asset classes in professionally managed retirement funds. According to insiders familiar with the plan, this shift aims to enable American workers to invest their retirement savings in a broader spectrum of opportunities, including digital assets, metals, and funds that focus on private loans and corporate takeovers. This executive order marks a significant acceleration in Trump’s efforts to mainstream cryptocurrency investments. His administration has already taken steps to ease regulatory burdens, notably by reversing a Biden-era policy that discouraged the inclusion of crypto options in retirement accounts. The recent passage of three crypto-related bills by the House, which Trump has vocally supported, further underscores his commitment to bolster the digital asset industry. The implications of opening the retirement market to private equity are vast. Major capital groups, including Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, have expressed keen interest in gaining access to 401(k) funds, which they view as a potential source of hundreds of billions in new assets. However, the push to integrate less liquid private investments into retirement plans carries inherent risks. Higher fees and reduced transparency regarding asset valuations may pose challenges for plan administrators and investors alike.

Adding staking functionality to the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) would allow the product, which debuted last July, to earn yield by using the held ETH to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, according to the 19b-4 proposal. Multiple issuers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and 21Shares, are also seeking to include staking in their funds. The SEC is due to issue decisions in October on similar requests for staking submitted by Cboe and the NYSE. It has an April deadline to weigh in on ETHA, although Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote in an X post Thursday that he doubted "it will take that long for a potential approval." "We think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25," Seyffart also wrote. Staking is not “done”. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25) https://t.co/QWn9L2DVPA — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 17, 2025 The feature has been controversial, with proponents saying it would increase returns while critics raise concerns about security vulnerabilities and market manipulation. Prospectuses for ETHA and the other eight Ethereum funds currently trading indicated that the products would not include staking, but the 19b-4 filing proposes deletes that passage and proposes new language allowing for it. "In consideration for any staking activity in which the Trust may engage, the Trust would receive all or a portion of the staking rewards generated by the staking provider, which may be treated as income to the Trust," the new language states. BlackRock's Ethereum fund has been the most successful in this category, generating more than $7 billion in net inflows, more than double the total of any other, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. It was recently trading at just below $26, up nearly 1% as of the close of trading Thursday. Ethereum ETFs have been surging in recent weeks, adding more than $2.2 billion in net investments over a nine-day streak. On Wednesday, they hit a record daily high with $726.6 million in inflows, including nearly $500 million from ETHA alone.

The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026, and over 50% through 2029. “This acquisition enhances Talen’s fleet by selectively adding modern, highly efficient baseload H-class CCGTs in Talen’s key markets, where we are an innovator in data center contracting,” said Mac McFarland, Talen President and Chief Executive Officer. “The transaction is immediately and highly accretive, maintains our balance sheet discipline, and adds more than the equivalent of another Susquehanna nuclear plant to our platform, further enabling large load service.” “Caithness has built an extensive portfolio of leading-edge power generation facilities to support our valued customers,” said James D. Bishop, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Caithness Energy. “We are proud of what we have accomplished and this sale to Talen positions the assets for continued success under a strong and successful management team.” ⸻ Key Strategic and Acquisition Highlights Additional Transaction DetailsTalen expects to issue approximately $3.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisitions and refinance target debt, using both secured and unsecured instruments.

Title: Ethereum: Is this the start of a 2017-style ETH rally? – Data suggests…

Ethereum rallies 8%, with institutional buys boosting momentum. Could ETH mirror its 2017 breakout to $6,200? Ethereum was setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. With the dwindling supply of ETH on CEXs at 13.4% lower than that of Bitcoin, a rally could be imminent. Can institutions make this happen? Ethereum [ETH] was trading at $3,435 at the time of writing, with the altcoin up about 8% in the last 24 hours. The daily trading volume was about $52M at the time of writing, about $20M short of what Bitcoin [BTC] had. As the altcoin continues to rally, analysts are betting on it to repeat previous successes. Can Ethereum do it? Analyst Mister Crypto on X, formerly Twitter, predicted that a rally for ETH was coming. The prediction came from the analysis that showed Ethereum could repeat its 2017 pattern. Mister Crypto’s prediction suggested that ETH could surpass $6,200, which would coincide with the high of $385 in 2017. His tweet read; “ETH is setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. If history repeats, a massive rally is imminent here!” Looking at the current price action, the chart confirms the potential outlook. Price had consolidated since mid-June to mid-July but had swept liquidity on both sides with false breakouts. Meanwhile, the volume bars were increasing as ETH pumped higher. Source: TradingView Ethereum’s continued price rise is boosting confidence that it could mirror its 2017 breakout. Analysts and institutions are closely watching the altcoin, with deeper research revealing they’re actively contributing to the rally’s momentum. BlackRock has added 159,101 ETH worth $499 million, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to 2.021 million ETH, valued at approximately $7 billion. This sizable accumulation places BlackRock firmly on the radar of Ethereum’s potential rally. Source: Whale Insider/X Still, Trump’s World Liberty Finance (WLFi) joined this purchase trail. While backing this potential surge, Ted Pillows reported that WLFi bought $4.99M worth of ETH. Ted Pillows also backed the bullishness, saying; “This is the worst time to be bearish on Ethereum.” WLFi added another batch of ETH, bringing its total purchases for the day to $10 million. Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming acquired 10,850 ETH, pushing its total Ethereum holdings to $1.03 billion. Combined, these moves raised the total ETH held in strategic reserves to 1.6 million ETH. This buying spree coincided with signs of a looming Ethereum supply crunch. According to Glassnode, ETH’s supply on exchanges dropped to 13.4%, compared to Bitcoin’s 14.5%, indicating stronger demand for Ethereum. If this trend continues, Ethereum could be on track to mirror its explosive 2017 rally. Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s shrinking supply is partly due to its growing staking market cap, which continues to climb. This trend may accelerate as banks increasingly choose Ethereum as the foundation for deploying their stablecoins, boosting demand even further.

Title: BlackRock moves to add staking to Ethereum ETF amid surge in inflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-moves-to-add-staking-to-ethereum-etf-amid-surge-in-inflows/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T19:45:03Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has filed to incorporate staking into its iShares Ethereum Trust (ticker: ETHA), the largest Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by assets under management. The move, disclosed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, follows growing institutional interest in Ethereum staking products and comes amid record-breaking net inflows into ETH ETFs. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq under SEC Rule 19b-4, which national securities exchanges follow to propose new fund structures. BlackRock is the latest asset manager to pursue staking capabilities for its Ethereum fund, joining a competitive field that includes Grayscale, 21Shares, and others with similar proposals already in the pipeline. BlackRock’s filing outlines that the trust may stake “all or a portion” of its ETH holdings through one or more trusted staking providers. The proposal specifies that the ether held by the trust will not be pooled with other entities, nor will the trust assume risk on behalf of others from slashing or network forks. Coinbase, currently acting as custodian and prime execution agent for ETHA, is expected to serve as the fund’s staking partner. The filing comes at a moment of surging interest in Ethereum investment products. On Wednesday, ETH ETFs recorded their highest single-day net inflow since launch, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA accounting for $499 million of that sum. So far in July, ETH ETFs have attracted over $2.27 billion in net inflows, marking the strongest monthly inflow to date, according to data from SoSoValue. ETHA was approved in July 2024, as part of a group of spot Ethereum ETFs greenlit by the SEC shortly after it approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. ETHA currently holds over $7.9 billion in assets, underscoring BlackRock’s leadership position in Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, has previously signaled that staking would be the “next phase” for crypto ETFs. Thursday’s filing appears to make that vision concrete, at a time when regulatory momentum and investor interest are aligning. BlackRock’s move comes shortly after the SEC approved the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, the first US-based staking ETF, earlier this month. That product was approved under the more stringent Securities Exchange Act of 1940. In contrast, BlackRock’s ETHA staking proposal falls under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, under which no staking ETF has yet been approved. However, SEC officials have indicated growing openness to staking ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X (formerly Twitter) that “staking is not done,” predicting that approval for Ethereum staking ETFs may arrive as early as Q4 2025. While BlackRock’s latest filing may not receive a final decision until around April 2026, the broader outlook for staking products appears favorable. As Ethereum’s price hovers near $3,399—still below its 2021 all-time high of $4,878—the prospect of yield-generating, regulated staking products could further fuel institutional adoption. With competitors also eyeing staking ETFs for assets like Cronos, Tron, and Injective, BlackRock’s move signals an increasingly diverse crypto ETF landscape taking shape.

Title: Canary continues altcoin ETF strategy with application to launch Injective fund with staking

Canary Capital's staked Injective ETF aims to grant investors regulated on-chain yield access amid the evolving regulatory landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Canary Capital has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the first-ever staked Injective (INJ) exchange-traded fund, aiming to provide institutional investors with regulated access to native on-chain yield. The proposed Canary Staked INJ ETF would actively stake its INJ holdings on the Injective proof-of-stake network, passing staking rewards, currently estimated at 10% to 12% annually, directly to shareholders. It also signals growing market confidence in Injective’s ecosystem, which has attracted strategic backing from firms like Google Cloud and T-Mobile. Injective Labs is also actively engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. regulators to define compliant pathways for decentralized finance. The INJ ETF is part of a larger push by Canary Capital, a firm led by former Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg, to bring high-yield digital assets into traditional market structures. Canary has already filed for ETFs tied to Solana, XRP, Hedera, Sui, and the Pudgy Penguins NFT project. Several of these applications include staking components, such as its Marinade-powered Solana ETF, positioning the firm as a leader in staking-integrated investment products. Canary established a Delaware statutory trust to support the INJ fund, mirroring its previous filings and signaling intent to meet the SEC’s evolving expectations around custodianship, validator selection, and yield treatment. The proposal lands during Crypto Week 2025, as lawmakers debate multiple bills that could define the legal framework for staking and other crypto-native activities. With SEC leadership now more open to structured yield products, Canary’s timing reflects a calculated bet on a regulatory shift. Several issuers are looking to include staking in upcoming ETFs. Some have also filed to activate staking for spot Ethereum ETFs that are already live, including BlackRock.

Title: Nasdaq applies to include staking in BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF as SEC weighs broader industry requests
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/nasdaq-applies-to-include-staking-in-blackrocks-ethereum-etf-as-sec-weighs-broader-industry-requests/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T18:46:06Z
Full Content:
BlackRock now joins a list of similar requests from issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21shares. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The rule change would add a detailed “staking” section permitting BlackRock to stake Ethereum (ETH) directly or through one or more trusted staking providers. BlackRock would treat received rewards as income, and the firm must hold the staked coins in arrangements consistent with a May statement by the SEC Division of Corporation Finance on certain protocol staking activities. Notably, the asset manager must also obtain either a counsel opinion or US government guidance on federal tax treatment before it starts. Furthermore, in the event of slashing or forking, BlackRock will not subsidize or absorb incoming losses. Nasdaq stated that its proposal would enable ETHA to capture returns while operating under defined constraints intended to protect shareholders and the market. BlackRock joins a queue of issuers that have asked regulators to let their US-based spot Ethereum products earn protocol rewards. Cboe seeks authority for Fidelity’s FETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, Invesco Galaxy’s QETH, and 21shares’ CETH. On NYSE Arca, Bitwise seeks approval to stake the ETH held in its ETHW. At the same time, Grayscale seeks the same approval for its ETHE and mini trust. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reacted to the Nasdaq submission on X, saying it was “about time.” The first final deadline for prior filings is in October, while the deadline for Nasdaq’s filing on BlackRock’s ETF is in early April. However, Seyffart believes it is unlikely for the SEC approval to take that long. US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $726 million in net inflows across nine funds on July 16, marking a daily record. ETHA led allocations with $499.2 million, marking a record for daily inflows into the fund, representing nearly 69% of the total. The heavy inflows may indicate that institutional investors are betting on Ethereum’s fundamentals, such as its infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenized assets.

Title: BlackRock, Nasdaq seek SEC approval to add staking to BlackRock’s spot Ether ETF
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/staking-spot-ether-etf/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:45:26Z
Full Content:
Share this article Nasdaq has proposed a rule change with the SEC to enable staking capabilities for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, also known as ETHA. According to a new 19b-4 filing, the fund would be able to stake all or a portion of ETHA’s Ether through one or more trusted staking providers if granted approval by the securities regulator. The proposal also indicates that staking rewards would be treated as income. With this move, BlackRock officially joins a number of fund managers pursuing permission to incorporate staking into their Ethereum funds. These include 21Shares, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Cboe BZX Exchange filed, on behalf of 21Shares, to seek comments regarding permitting the staking of Ether held by the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. The SEC acknowledged the filing in February. In March, the exchange filed a proposal to enable staking for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET). NYSE Arca submitted a proposal on behalf of Grayscale to enable Ethereum staking within its ETFs, specifically the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Before the SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, industry leaders such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco/Galaxy had sought to offer staking as part of their Ethereum ETFs. This feature would have allowed fund managers to stake the underlying Ethereum holdings, generating additional yields for investors through the Ethereum network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. However, the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, raised concerns that staking-as-a-service offerings could be classified as unregistered securities. The regulator previously targeted firms offering staking services, like Coinbase and Kraken. In response to the SEC’s position, these firms amended their Ethereum ETF applications and removed the staking provisions. The removal of staking capabilities was speculated to influence ARK Invest’s decision to withdraw its Ethereum ETF plans. Without staking, the ETFs would only track Ether’s price, excluding the approximately 3% yield available through staking rewards. This makes the product less attractive to investors seeking growth in their holdings through staking rewards. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo July 17 (Reuters) – China is threatening to block the sale of more than 40 ports, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) if Chinese shipping company Cosco does not get a stake, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. Reuters could not immediately verify the WSJ report. CK Hutchison, MSC, BlackRock and Cosco did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment, while the Chinese government could not be immediately reached outside office hours. Chinese officials have told BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison that if Cosco is left out of the deal, Beijing would take steps to block Hutchison’s proposed sale of the ports, the newspaper said. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison in March announced it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value of $22.8 billion, including debt. After much scrutiny and criticism in China, Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison confirmed in May Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC, one of the world’s top container shipping groups, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy the ports. BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison all are open to Cosco taking a stake, WSJ said. However, the parties would likely not reach a deal before a previously agreed upon July 27 deadline for exclusive talks between BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison, the report added. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced.

Title: China threatens to squash Panama ports deal unless its shipping giant gets an equal stake: report

China has threatened to block a deal for dozens of global ports – including two near the Panama canal – if its own shipping giant doesn’t get a sizable stake, according to a report Thursday. The deal, valued at around $20 billion, hands over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to US asset manager BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. China is demanding that Cosco, its largest shipping firm, be an equal partner to BlackRock and MSC in the deal, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. BlackRock, MSC and Li’s firm, CK Hutchison, are all open to that idea, sources said. “As far as I know, Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation once stated that it would review in accordance with the law the plan of CK Hutchison Holdings to sell assets such as the Panama Canal Port, to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests,” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, told The Post in a statement. “As principle, I would like to stress that China has always firmly opposed economic coercion and domineering and bullying practices.” MSC and Cosco did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. The firms are currently staring down a July 27 deadline, when exclusive talks between the three partners will end and Cosco can be added to the deal. But that change will likely anger President Trump, who has viewed the deal as a national security win as he argues that the US needs to “take back” the waterway. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have told Chinese state-owned companies to freeze any incoming deals with Hutchison or other businesses linked to Li, sources told the Journal. The inclusion of Cosco emerged as a way to nudge the deal forward following intense US-China trade talks in Switzerland, Bloomberg reported last month. Chinese authorities have told BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison that without Cosco’s inclusion in the deal, Beijing will take steps to block the sale, sources said. And the firms involved in the deal can’t afford to burn bridges with China. BlackRock and Hutchison both have interests in the nation, and MSC is one of the largest shippers of Chinese exports in the world. Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business, MSC, has emerged as the lead investor in the deal, though BlackRock is notably expected to take over the two key Panama ports included in the sale. The deal is expected to position MSC as the world’s largest terminal operator. It wouldn’t be the first time China has squashed such a deal. In 2014, it blocked a major shipping alliance between MSC, Denmark’s AP Moeller-Maersk and France’s CMA CGM.

Title: Apple Inks $500M Deal With the Only US Rare Earth Miner Amid US-China Trade War

Apple is teaming up with MP Materials, the only rare earth miner in the U.S., to build a $500 million plant in Texas that will recycle and manufacture rare earth magnets—key components used in everything from iPhones to fighter jets. The move comes as the U.S. looks to bring more of its tech supply chain back home and reduce its reliance on China, which currently dominates global rare earth processing. These minerals have been making headlines lately, not just for their role in cutting-edge tech, but also as flashpoints in rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The new facility will feature neodymium magnet production lines tailored to Apple’s specific hardware needs. It’s part of Apple’s broader plan to invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over four years. MP Materials expects to begin shipping magnets to Apple as early as 2027. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. Rare earth magnets are critical for a wide range of products, from iPhones and electric vehicles to fighter jets and missile guidance systems. Yet the U.S. has historically depended on China for nearly all rare earth processing. While these minerals are not rare geologically, they are expensive and complex to process, and China currently controls about 92 percent of global output. Apple’s announcement follows a major move by the U.S. Department of Defense, which last week made a $400 million investment in MP Materials as part of a landmark public-private partnership. The Pentagon purchased a new class of convertible preferred shares along with a 10-year warrant at $30.03 per share. If fully exercised, the government could hold a roughly 15 percent stake in the company—more than major shareholders like BlackRock or co-founder James Litinsky. Funds from the Defense Department will go toward building another magnet plant, which will produce a new class of “10X” magnets. The Pentagon has committed to purchasing 100 percent of that output over the next decade. That facility is expected to open in 2028 and will boost MP Materials’ annual magnet capacity to 10,000 metric tons—enough to meet a significant share of U.S. demand. Apple, meanwhile, has already begun reducing its dependence on newly mined rare earths by prioritizing recycled materials. By 2023, the company reported that about two-thirds of the aluminum, three-fourths of the rare earth elements and 95 percent of the tungsten used in its products came from recycled sources. That same year, Apple also pledged to use only recycled cobalt in its batteries going forward. The moves by Apple and the Pentagon are part of a broader U.S. push to nearshore rare earth supply chains. Earlier this year, President Trump proposed annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory estimated to contain $4.4 trillion worth of rare earth reserves. Vice President JD Vance made a surprise visit in support of the plan. Meanwhile, rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have underscored the strategic importance of rare earth independence. In April, China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals bound for the U.S. The controls were lifted on May 11 as part of a 90-day trade truce, but the episode highlighted the risks of continued reliance on China for such critical materials.

Title: ​Fighting Together for Life, Water, and Land: From Line 5 to Gaza

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. Environmental and Native American activists rally to shut down the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline, which runs under the Straits of Mackinac, in Detroit, Michigan. The deep connections between Line 5 and Gaza serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for united, organized resistance to defend justice, the land, and human and nonhuman life. In the United States, we are fighting a rapid descent into authoritarianism that is already having disastrous consequences for people, communities, and the environment. At the same time, grassroots movements across the globe are fighting to defend life, water, and land. These fights may seem worlds apart, but they are in fact intertwined at their roots. Here we will explore two examples that are not unique, but have been chosen because they make visible the underlying structural and political forces that link seemingly disparate struggles across the world. We believe that recognizing these links is necessary for building the powerful coalitions we need to resist in these critical times. In Wisconsin, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa—a sovereign Indigenous nation—is leading a battle that resonates far beyond its borders. In coalition with local, national, and international organizations and activists, the Band is saying no to the exploitation of its land and people by fossil fuel giants; saying no to pipelines that endanger waterways, wetlands, and wild rice beds essential to their culture and survival; and saying no to fossil fuel extraction that accelerates the climate crisis. At the heart of this struggle lies Enbridge’s Line 5—a 645-mile pipeline transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids from Wisconsin to Ontario. Line 5 does not stand alone but is linked to a much larger network of pipelines that begin in the tar sands fields of Canada and transport one of the dirtiest forms of fossil fuel. The aging Line 5 cuts directly through the Bad River Band’s reservation, but easements for this pipeline expired in 2013. Enbridge now plans to reroute the pipeline around the reservation despite years of legal battles and overwhelming public opposition. Enbridge has a well-documented history of spills and environmental destruction and, as an investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, supported the violent attacks on Indigenous activists at Standing Rock. Enbridge’s reroute of Line 5 remains a direct threat to fragile ecosystems and Indigenous sovereignty. At the same time, thousands of miles away, millions of Palestinians are being displaced and tens of thousands killed by an all-out military assault in Gaza that targets the entire population and infrastructure for life. This is accompanied by accelerating state-supported violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. The relentless bombings, mass displacement, deliberate starvation, and destruction of civilian life carried out by Israel and the U.S. against the Palestinian people amounts not to a conventional war but to genocide. The U.S. and Israel are now openly discussing a plan to permanently remove Palestinians and take over Gaza and the West Bank, completing a process of ethnic cleansing that has been ongoing for over 100 years. What links a battle over a pipeline in Wisconsin to the crisis in Gaza and the West Bank? Everything. The fight against Line 5 isn’t merely about fossil fuels—it’s a stand against a global system of colonialism, militarism, and capitalism that drives the climate crisis. The ethnic cleansing and genocide directed at Palestinians represent the advancement of a long-term colonial project that uses violence and militarism to secure access to land and resources. In a critical moment when we face a rising tide of fascism in the U.S. and abroad, the deep connections between Line 5 and Gaza serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for united, organized resistance to defend justice, the land, and human and nonhuman life. Colonialism is about dominance and control. Whether imposed on Indigenous nations in the United States or on Palestinians abroad, its purpose is to grant powerful states and corporations unfettered access to land and resources, fueling profits and increased power for ruling elites. In Gaza—and increasingly in the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and Syria—the brutal legacy of settler colonialism is on display. Since at least 1947, Israel has pursued colonization in Palestine, displacing native inhabitants and instituting an apartheid system to control those who remain. Military force and state-sponsored violence have systematically stripped Palestinians of their land, water, property, and freedom, a process bolstered by political, financial, and military support from Western powers. In particular, Israel is critical to strategic U.S. military and political presence in the Middle East; in other words, it is central to U.S. imperialism. The current crisis in Gaza is an escalation of this long-term project. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. The systems at work in Gaza are the same as those that drive projects like Line 5. The history of the U.S. is one of colonial expansion, of violently appropriating land and resources from native inhabitants and transferring it to the U.S. government and settlers. Even now, the U.S. government and powerful corporate interests ignore the rights of Indigenous sovereign nations and ram through pipelines, mines, and other projects despite their environmental and social dangers and opposition from tribes. Projects like Line 5 are a continuation of a multi-century colonial project that stretches from from the Indian Wars in the 19th century to the militarized response to the Indigenous-led resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. Whether it manifests through violent repression of protest or the displacement of entire ethnic groups, the same colonial logic is at work. Israel’s occupation and blockade of Gaza aims to secure access to land, water, and offshore natural gas reserves for themselves and their corporate and political allies. The same drive for control and access to resources underpins Line 5, linking these two struggles in a broader fight against colonialism, exploitation, and global corporate power. Militarism fuels colonialism. It is also essential to the fossil fuel industry, the core driver of the climate crisis. The U.S. military extends across an estimated 750 overseas bases in 80 countries. This web of influence props up transnational fossil fuel networks that depend on protection and the threat of force to extract and transport oil and gas around the globe. The paramilitary response to activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline and Line 3 in Minnesota are local examples that illustrate this relationship. The U.S. invests $800 billion into the military each year, money that could be spent on the public good but is instead used to underwrite a global system of extraction and exploitation. The U.S. military also contributes to the climate crisis in more direct ways. The U.S. Department of Defense is the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels and is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than many nations. Wars and conflict contribute significantly to carbon emissions and also drive widespread environmental devastation that destroys local livelihoods. U.S. military bases are ranked as among the most polluted in the world, damaging land and water in surrounding areas with past nuclear testing and toxic chemicals. Militarism is also deeply intertwined with corporate interests. Big defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Oshkosh Defense, and Raytheon profit from the devastation in Gaza. Such contractors are also deeply intertwined with private security firms like Blackrock. These security firms are deployed by fossil fuel companies to protect fossil fuel infrastructure projects like Line 5, harming Indigenous communities and intensifying climate collapse. In short, the U.S. military reinforces a system that prizes profit over human life. The struggles in Gaza and against Line 5 are two sides of the same coin. Palestinians resisting occupation and Indigenous nations opposing pipelines face the same force: militarized, transnational government-corporate alliances. Their fight is not solely for their own physical and cultural survival—it is a battle for justice and freedom for all people and the planet. The climate crisis is inseparable from the forces of militarism, colonialism, and capitalism. Climate change is also contributing to a related crisis—the rise of fascism and the demonization of immigrants. As global temperatures climb, environmental disasters and unpredictability increase, contributing to economic destabilization and a general sense of uncertainty and fear. This creates an ideal breeding ground for fascist ideologies that promise greater security (for some) through the exercise of state control, brute strength, and the scapegoating of the vulnerable—all while siphoning money and power to corporations. Climate change also drives the displacement of people, as extreme heat, flooding, drought, and other environmental disasters force entire regions into unlivable conditions. In 2022 alone, over 43 million people were displaced by climate-related events, from hurricanes and floods to shifts in agricultural viability. This number is set to grow, creating an ever-growing wave of climate refugees. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. Rather than addressing the root causes of climate change, developing plans for adaptation that serve the public good, or offering refuge to those forced to migrate, many governments worldwide are responding with authoritarian measures. Fascist leaders paint climate refugees as threats, blaming migrants and marginalized communities for crises they did not create. In the U.S., we see this in the criminalization of immigration, mass deportation, the expansion of border walls, and the deployment of surveillance technologies—many of which were first developed in Israel and tested on Palestinians. These policies only worsen human suffering while deflecting attention from the real culprits: fossil fuel corporations, militarism, and capitalist greed. These rising authoritarian impulses are deeply linked to the fight against Line 5 and resistance to Israel’s expansion. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. The November 2024 election and turn toward fascism in the U.S. have underscored the urgency of grassroots resistance. Corporate and right-wing forces are aligning in unprecedented ways, fueled by economic inequality, xenophobia, fear, and disinformation. Authoritarian regimes in the U.S. and abroad, including Israel, are poised to further expand corporate power, fossil fuel extraction, militarism, and state oppression in frightening ways. This convergence poses an escalating threat to human communities and the natural world. The fight against Line 5, led by the Bad River Band, and the global solidarity movement for Palestine both stand at the forefront of grassroots resistance to these converging forces. Broadening our lens, we can see such resistance taking place all over the world: in the anti-pipeline struggles in East Africa, the efforts of Indigenous communities in the Amazon to protect their land and way of life, and the bravery of anti-mining activists in El Salvador, to name just a few examples. These movements remind us that these battles in specific places are part of a broader struggle against interconnected systems of oppression—something that has long been recognized by local communities and Indigenous-led organizations worldwide. Our organizing must be both intersectional and international. We must connect struggles that have too often been treated in isolation. The same forces that drive the expansion of Line 5 and the attacks on Palestinian life are at work in militarized occupations and conflicts abroad, the construction of border walls and the criminalization of migrants, and the climate crisis itself. By challenging these forces at home, and acting in solidarity with those abroad, we strike at the roots of a global system of exploitation and oppression. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. We must forge alliances with diverse movements from Wisconsin to East Africa to the Philippines, recognizing that we succeed or fail together. Despite these dangerous and difficult times, a different world is possible when we unite and act as one. In the United States, we are fighting a rapid descent into authoritarianism that is already having disastrous consequences for people, communities, and the environment. At the same time, grassroots movements across the globe are fighting to defend life, water, and land. These fights may seem worlds apart, but they are in fact intertwined at their roots.

In particular, Israel is critical to strategic U.S. military and political presence in the Middle East; in other words, it is central to U.S. imperialism. The current crisis in Gaza is an escalation of this long-term project. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. The systems at work in Gaza are the same as those that drive projects like Line 5. The history of the U.S. is one of colonial expansion, of violently appropriating land and resources from native inhabitants and transferring it to the U.S. government and settlers. Even now, the U.S. government and powerful corporate interests ignore the rights of Indigenous sovereign nations and ram through pipelines, mines, and other projects despite their environmental and social dangers and opposition from tribes. Projects like Line 5 are a continuation of a multi-century colonial project that stretches from from the Indian Wars in the 19th century to the militarized response to the Indigenous-led resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. Whether it manifests through violent repression of protest or the displacement of entire ethnic groups, the same colonial logic is at work. Israel’s occupation and blockade of Gaza aims to secure access to land, water, and offshore natural gas reserves for themselves and their corporate and political allies. The same drive for control and access to resources underpins Line 5, linking these two struggles in a broader fight against colonialism, exploitation, and global corporate power. Militarism fuels colonialism. It is also essential to the fossil fuel industry, the core driver of the climate crisis. The U.S. military extends across an estimated 750 overseas bases in 80 countries. This web of influence props up transnational fossil fuel networks that depend on protection and the threat of force to extract and transport oil and gas around the globe. The paramilitary response to activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline and Line 3 in Minnesota are local examples that illustrate this relationship. The U.S. invests $800 billion into the military each year, money that could be spent on the public good but is instead used to underwrite a global system of extraction and exploitation. The U.S. military also contributes to the climate crisis in more direct ways. The U.S. Department of Defense is the world’s largest institutional consumer of fossil fuels and is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than many nations. Wars and conflict contribute significantly to carbon emissions and also drive widespread environmental devastation that destroys local livelihoods. U.S. military bases are ranked as among the most polluted in the world, damaging land and water in surrounding areas with past nuclear testing and toxic chemicals. Militarism is also deeply intertwined with corporate interests. Big defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Oshkosh Defense, and Raytheon profit from the devastation in Gaza. Such contractors are also deeply intertwined with private security firms like Blackrock. These security firms are deployed by fossil fuel companies to protect fossil fuel infrastructure projects like Line 5, harming Indigenous communities and intensifying climate collapse. In short, the U.S. military reinforces a system that prizes profit over human life. The struggles in Gaza and against Line 5 are two sides of the same coin. Palestinians resisting occupation and Indigenous nations opposing pipelines face the same force: militarized, transnational government-corporate alliances. Their fight is not solely for their own physical and cultural survival—it is a battle for justice and freedom for all people and the planet. The climate crisis is inseparable from the forces of militarism, colonialism, and capitalism. Climate change is also contributing to a related crisis—the rise of fascism and the demonization of immigrants. As global temperatures climb, environmental disasters and unpredictability increase, contributing to economic destabilization and a general sense of uncertainty and fear. This creates an ideal breeding ground for fascist ideologies that promise greater security (for some) through the exercise of state control, brute strength, and the scapegoating of the vulnerable—all while siphoning money and power to corporations. Climate change also drives the displacement of people, as extreme heat, flooding, drought, and other environmental disasters force entire regions into unlivable conditions. In 2022 alone, over 43 million people were displaced by climate-related events, from hurricanes and floods to shifts in agricultural viability. This number is set to grow, creating an ever-growing wave of climate refugees. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. Rather than addressing the root causes of climate change, developing plans for adaptation that serve the public good, or offering refuge to those forced to migrate, many governments worldwide are responding with authoritarian measures. Fascist leaders paint climate refugees as threats, blaming migrants and marginalized communities for crises they did not create. In the U.S., we see this in the criminalization of immigration, mass deportation, the expansion of border walls, and the deployment of surveillance technologies—many of which were first developed in Israel and tested on Palestinians. These policies only worsen human suffering while deflecting attention from the real culprits: fossil fuel corporations, militarism, and capitalist greed. These rising authoritarian impulses are deeply linked to the fight against Line 5 and resistance to Israel’s expansion. Indigenous and Palestinian struggles confront the same systems that aim to strengthen corporate and elite interests at the expense of everyday people and vulnerable populations, further deepening global inequality. The November 2024 election and turn toward fascism in the U.S. have underscored the urgency of grassroots resistance. Corporate and right-wing forces are aligning in unprecedented ways, fueled by economic inequality, xenophobia, fear, and disinformation. Authoritarian regimes in the U.S. and abroad, including Israel, are poised to further expand corporate power, fossil fuel extraction, militarism, and state oppression in frightening ways. This convergence poses an escalating threat to human communities and the natural world. The fight against Line 5, led by the Bad River Band, and the global solidarity movement for Palestine both stand at the forefront of grassroots resistance to these converging forces. Broadening our lens, we can see such resistance taking place all over the world: in the anti-pipeline struggles in East Africa, the efforts of Indigenous communities in the Amazon to protect their land and way of life, and the bravery of anti-mining activists in El Salvador, to name just a few examples. These movements remind us that these battles in specific places are part of a broader struggle against interconnected systems of oppression—something that has long been recognized by local communities and Indigenous-led organizations worldwide. Our organizing must be both intersectional and international. We must connect struggles that have too often been treated in isolation. The same forces that drive the expansion of Line 5 and the attacks on Palestinian life are at work in militarized occupations and conflicts abroad, the construction of border walls and the criminalization of migrants, and the climate crisis itself. By challenging these forces at home, and acting in solidarity with those abroad, we strike at the roots of a global system of exploitation and oppression. Climate justice movements in the U.S. must recognize not only the moral imperative but the strategic necessity of centering struggles for immigrant rights, Indigenous and Palestinian sovereignty, and struggles against militarism and fascism. We must forge alliances with diverse movements from Wisconsin to East Africa to the Philippines, recognizing that we succeed or fail together. Despite these dangerous and difficult times, a different world is possible when we unite and act as one. In the United States, we are fighting a rapid descent into authoritarianism that is already having disastrous consequences for people, communities, and the environment. At the same time, grassroots movements across the globe are fighting to defend life, water, and land. These fights may seem worlds apart, but they are in fact intertwined at their roots. Here we will explore two examples that are not unique, but have been chosen because they make visible the underlying structural and political forces that link seemingly disparate struggles across the world. We believe that recognizing these links is necessary for building the powerful coalitions we need to resist in these critical times. In Wisconsin, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa—a sovereign Indigenous nation—is leading a battle that resonates far beyond its borders. In coalition with local, national, and international organizations and activists, the Band is saying no to the exploitation of its land and people by fossil fuel giants; saying no to pipelines that endanger waterways, wetlands, and wild rice beds essential to their culture and survival; and saying no to fossil fuel extraction that accelerates the climate crisis. At the heart of this struggle lies Enbridge’s Line 5—a 645-mile pipeline transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids from Wisconsin to Ontario. Line 5 does not stand alone but is linked to a much larger network of pipelines that begin in the tar sands fields of Canada and transport one of the dirtiest forms of fossil fuel. The aging Line 5 cuts directly through the Bad River Band’s reservation, but easements for this pipeline expired in 2013. Enbridge now plans to reroute the pipeline around the reservation despite years of legal battles and overwhelming public opposition. Enbridge has a well-documented history of spills and environmental destruction and, as an investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, supported the violent attacks on Indigenous activists at Standing Rock. Enbridge’s reroute of Line 5 remains a direct threat to fragile ecosystems and Indigenous sovereignty. At the same time, thousands of miles away, millions of Palestinians are being displaced and tens of thousands killed by an all-out military assault in Gaza that targets the entire population and infrastructure for life. This is accompanied by accelerating state-supported violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. The relentless bombings, mass displacement, deliberate starvation, and destruction of civilian life carried out by Israel and the U.S. against the Palestinian people amounts not to a conventional war but to genocide. The U.S. and Israel are now openly discussing a plan to permanently remove Palestinians and take over Gaza and the West Bank, completing a process of ethnic cleansing that has been ongoing for over 100 years. What links a battle over a pipeline in Wisconsin to the crisis in Gaza and the West Bank? Everything. The fight against Line 5 isn’t merely about fossil fuels—it’s a stand against a global system of colonialism, militarism, and capitalism that drives the climate crisis. The ethnic cleansing and genocide directed at Palestinians represent the advancement of a long-term colonial project that uses violence and militarism to secure access to land and resources. In a critical moment when we face a rising tide of fascism in the U.S. and abroad, the deep connections between Line 5 and Gaza serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for united, organized resistance to defend justice, the land, and human and nonhuman life. Colonialism is about dominance and control. Whether imposed on Indigenous nations in the United States or on Palestinians abroad, its purpose is to grant powerful states and corporations unfettered access to land and resources, fueling profits and increased power for ruling elites. In Gaza—and increasingly in the West Bank, southern Lebanon, and Syria—the brutal legacy of settler colonialism is on display. Since at least 1947, Israel has pursued colonization in Palestine, displacing native inhabitants and instituting an apartheid system to control those who remain. Military force and state-sponsored violence have systematically stripped Palestinians of their land, water, property, and freedom, a process bolstered by political, financial, and military support from Western powers.

Δ The goal, as The New York Times (NYT) reported Thursday (July 17), is to benefit from the rising demand for electricity from data centers. Among the investment groups engaged in this effort is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which wants to acquire Minnesota Power. That utility owns several power plants and thousands of miles of power lines that could help artificial intelligence (AI) companies secure energy for their data centers. However, this deal is facing pushback, with a state administrative law judge recommending this week late Tuesday that Minnesota utility regulators deny the proposed acquisition. Another investment group, private equity firm Blackstone, announced an agreement in May to purchase Albuquerque-based TXNM Energy, which provides electricity to 800,000 residential and business customers in New Mexico and Texas. These efforts have drawn criticism from consumer and progressive groups, who argue investment firms shouldn’t own electric utilities as they typically want to maximize profits, often by burdening the company’s finances with debt. This approach, the critics argue, could lead to much higher rates and worse service. “No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms,” said Nichole Heil, senior researcher and campaign director for climate at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. The report notes that electricity rates are rising around the country, in part because of upgrades to address climate change, and in part because of increased demand from AI data centers. The news comes days after the announcement that Google, Meta, Blackstone and CoreWeave were planning to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to construct new AI data centers Google told PYMNTS Tuesday (July 15) that it plans to spend $25 billion over the next two years on data centers and AI infrastructure in the PJM electric grid region, a coverage area that runs from New Jersey to North Carolina and Illinois to the nation’s capital. “Google’s investments announced today will increase energy abundance and empower Americans with the skills needed to thrive in the AI era,” Alphabet and Google President Ruth Porat said in a statement provided to PYMNTS. One day earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on a Facebook post that his company would invest “hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence.” Compute refers to computational power, covering chips, servers and connectivity in data centers.

Title: India Asset Management – Key drivers and trends (Anusha Sivaramakrishnan)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28920/india-asset-management--key-drivers-and-trends
Time Published: 2025-07-17T11:04:26Z
Full Content:
Overview The Indian asset management industry has witnessed remarkable growth over the past decade, driven by an increasing awareness of financial planning, a surge in retail participation, and robust economic expansion. This sector, which encompasses mutual funds, portfolio management services, and alternative investment funds, has become a pivotal part of India's financial landscape with a total AUM of ~₹117 or $1.3 trillion. With the asset management industry growing 6x in the last decade, the outlook also looks positive with growth in mutual fund expected at CAGR of 14%, portfolio management services and alternative investment funds at CAGR of 26% till 2028. In the last decade (from FY14 to FY25), the PMS and AIF markets have been growing at a rate of 33% per year. As India aspires to have $35 trillion economy size by 2047 and enters its next phase of rapid development, PMSes and AIFs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for HNIs and UHNIs, seeking more personalized and higher-yielding investment options. This point of view explores the emerging trends and growth trajectory of the asset management industry with a specific focus on mutual funds. Key trends in mutual funds The India Mutual Fund Industry is expected to reach USD 0.78 trillion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of greater than 18% to reach USD 1.78 trillion by 2030. Millennials and Gen Z are increasingly interested in mutual funds because they are more likely to embrace technology and digital tools for investing. There is also an increased focus on expansion into smaller towns and rural areas by offering micro- investing which is as low as INR 500. Tier 2 and tier 3 cities now account for more than 35% of new SIP registrations, demonstrating the widening geographic spread of Indian mutual funds. Women investors now represent approximately 33% of new mutual fund accounts, showing improved gender diversity in the Indian financial market. With tools like mobile apps, robo-advisors, and data analytics, investors can manage their portfolios in real time and track their investments with ease. The use of technology makes mutual funds more accessible to the average Indian investor, who can now easily invest and track their portfolio from the comfort of their home. Partnerships between AMCs, fintech companies, and technology providers help in creating digital platforms that can offer a wide range of financial services in one place and build platforms that offer superior customer service, including faster onboarding, online transaction capabilities, better customer grievance resolution, efficient and timely dashboards. At the same time, digital payment systems make it easier to transfer funds and complete transactions. DSP Asset Managers has joined hands with Cybrilla to become one of the first mutual fund companies to go live on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The Network’s open design lets more distributors, including local entrepreneurs and fintech startups—offer mutual funds to a wider audience. Because ONDC Network is decentralized, DSP and its partners can create new investment products like daily SIPs or goal-based micro-investments. Newer thematic funds have adopted increasingly focused, narrow ideas. From housing, defense and manufacturing, NFOs have moved on to target themes like tourism, electric vehicles, rural opportunities, conglomerates, among other flavours. Among the latest offerings, funds are targeting ideas like Railway PSUs and premium consumption. . In India, the ESG theme is also gaining popularity, and a few fund houses have launched ESG-thematic funds. India's passive mutual fund AUM surged 21% YoY to ₹11.13 lakh crore in March 2025, with equity ETFs and index funds dominating the landscape. Passive funds now account for 16.7% of the overall mutual fund industry AUM, reflecting a growing shift towards index-linked strategies. The growth in passive AUM over the past year underlines a shift in investor preference towards low-cost, rule-based investment vehicles. While equity ETFs and index funds dominate the landscape, the performance of debt and commodity passive funds presents a nuanced picture of evolving investor sentiment and market conditions. Recently Jio BlackRock has received approval from India's markets regulator to launch five passive index funds. Key drivers for growth Financial literacy initiatives and campaigns by industry bodies like AMFI (Sahi hai, Bharat Nivesh Yatra etc) are playing a crucial role in educating investors about the benefits of mutual funds which is a significant factor for choosing mutual funds as an investment option among retail investors. Online platforms and mobile apps (Zerodha and Groww (1+ crore total users) have simplified the investment process, making it more convenient for retail investors, especially the younger generation. These platforms simplify investment journeys with features such as goal-based investing, real-time portfolio tracking and personalized recommendations, empowering investors to make informed and independent decisions. Declining interest rates on traditional savings instruments like fixed deposits have encouraged investors to explore higher-yielding options like stock markets. India’s total demat account is expected to cross 18 crores by Nov 2024 – growing by over 4 crores in 2024 alone. NSE recorded the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in Asia for the calendar year 2024 (CY24), with a total of 268 listings across its mainboard and SME platform. The trend is expected to continue in 2025; will enhance investor options. SEBI has permitted investments in new asset classes like REITs, InVITs, Gold and silver ETFs, expanding the investment options available to mutual funds. Alternative assets market in India is expected to grow 5X to USD 2 Tn by 2034. Alternative investments outperform traditional investment options, offering higher alpha, attracting increased interest from India’s HNI and UHNI segments SEBI has been instrumental in promoting transparency and lower costs in the mutual fund industry. Some of the regulations include the recent Mutual Fund Lite Regulations (2024) to bring compliance, new regulations seeking a clear segregation of offshore derivative instruments (ODIs) and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mandated more disclosures to reduce systemic risks in India's capital market relaxations for the passively managed schemes. Key challenges for fund houses Low financial literacy in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and a preference for traditional, more straightforward and perceived-safer options, such as fixed deposits, PPFs, and gold, hindered broader adoption. Similar challenges exist in the rural areas with the added factor of linguistic hindrances and lack of digital knowledge limiting the usage of digital platforms. There is more focus on the B-30 cities to attract investments, which has resulted in growth up to 40% in those cities. Severe market corrections and inherent volatility of equity markets have been major deterrents for casual retail investors from investing in mutual funds due to uncertain market returns. High investment costs in terms of total expense ratios due to exit loads, management fees and commissions are also additional challenges. Stable alternatives like public provident fund (PPF) also reduced the investments. HDFC Mutual Fund recently announced a hike in the Total Expense Ratio (TER) for its Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund from 0.67% to 0.73%. Despite increasing awareness mutual funds has limited set of AMFI distributors concentrated mainly in metropolitan areas. This has led to smaller investors and rural investors to take a cautious approach due to lack of advisory support and lack of confidence in investing independently in equity linked investments. Apart from the regular banks, another intriguing development is the inclusion of 18 boutique Mutual Fund Distributor (MFD) firms in the list of top 100. These boutique MFD firms are notably supported by individual MFDs, indicating a growing presence of niche, independent players. Although the mutual fund industry has made considerable progress in standardizing processes, a few challenges persist. These include simplifying the KYC procedures to ensure hassle-free onboarding, allowing Aadhaar to be used interchangeably with PAN, and enabling investments based on “Bank KYC”. The data localization requirements and cost sensitivity of Indian markets also hurt foreign fund houses. Only six of the Top 20 Asset Management companies in India are foreign owned fund houses. Among these, Invesco formed a joint venture with IndusInd International Holdings Limited (IIHL) by selling off 60% stake in 2024 and notable is the Jio Blackrock joint venture. The mutual fund companies are finding it difficult to expand into different businesses due to Clause 24 of the mutual fund regulation dealing with the issues pertaining to business activities that AMCs can take. The regulation mandates AMCs not to undertake business activities that are in conflict of interest with the core business of managing mutual fund schemes. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is reviewing its mutual fund regulations, including the scheme categorization framework and restrictions on asset management company (AMC) activities to simplify compliance and reduce regulatory burden. The growth trajectory At least six new fund houses have in-principle approval to set up the mutual fund business which includes big names like Jio Blackrock, Capital mind etc. While new entrants like Jio BlackRock plan to cater to all segments of the mutual fund business — including active, passive, and smart-beta strategies — and offer products across equity, debt, and hybrid categories, others are adopting a more focused approach. Some of the fund houses plan to exclusively offer passive funds, meanwhile others plan to concentrate on factor-based and quantitative investing strategies. Therefore, identifying the right theme is crucial for success. To attract NRI/foreign investments or overseas investments from India, many foreign FIs have set up branches in GIFT City. DSP Mutual Fund’s Global equity fund is the first open ended mutual fund for retail investors under the GIFT city which allows Indian residents to invest in a diversified portfolio of global equities. US-based State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management division of State Street Corporation, has established a strategic relationship with small case, a provider of model portfolios and investment platforms in India’s capital markets. The collaboration will enable SSGA to distribute its Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) ETFs through small case’s digital investment platform, opening up avenues for Indian investors to access global markets. Thus, foreign fund houses find it beneficial to partner with Indian Financial Institutions (Fis) to launch Asset Management Products. Anticipated advancements in fintech and AI will continue to reshape the mutual fund industry, offering innovative solutions for investors. Collaboration between AMCs, fintech startups, and technology providers will drive the expansion of integrated digital platforms, providing holistic financial solutions. Moreover, the proliferation of digital payment systems and open banking initiatives will facilitate seamless fund transfers and transaction processing, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of mutual fund services. Ensuring data privacy and protection is paramount, requiring continuous investment in cybersecurity measures and regulatory compliance initiatives. RTAs (Registrar and Transfer Agents) are the operational backbone of the mutual fund industry. RTAs leverage automation, enabling AMCs to scale operations efficiently while ensuring error-free processing and reliable services. This has significantly reduced operational costs and enhanced efficiency for AMCs, allowing them to cater to the market’s growing demands. RTAs also provide centralized digital platforms, offering investors real-time access to portfolios, transaction histories and account details, enhancing transparency and convenience. Women investors are increasingly making their mark in the mutual fund space, with their share of investments growing significantly over the past five years. According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), women now hold 33% of the total individual investor assets under management (AUM) as of March 2024. Conclusion In summary, the growth trajectory remains strong with 6x increase measured by AUM over the last decade or so is attributed to the concerted efforts of all stakeholders of the ecosystem. AMCs developed innovative products and made them attractive for average investors (SIPs, FoFs, ETFs, etc.); technological interventions such as digital-first platforms by new-age players and digital tools and infrastructure were established by RTAs to streamline onboarding, settlement, record-keeping and servicing; campaigns were created to drive customer awareness and distribution reach by AMFI (MF Sahi Hai, MFD Shuru Karein); and regulatory interventions were imposed around product simplicity, affordability, democratization and sustainability.

The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Vanguard made its first acquisition in 2021, but by the looks of it, it may just be the last. The Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm is now facing a lawsuit stemming from the purchase of JustInvest, one of a handful of direct indexing platforms that were all the rage back in the early 2020s. The complaint alleges the world’s second-largest money manager acted in bad faith post-sale by thwarting certain business deals that would have led to payouts for JustInvest founders and shareholders. Even today, Vanguard investors aren’t able to use the service, which was rebranded Vanguard Personalized Indexing Management, nor can the firm’s in-house advisors, according to Jeff DeMaso, editor of the newsletter the Independent Vanguard Advisor. So, why the acquisition in the first place? “Perhaps it was a move to defend the firm against the risk that direct indexing would replace index mutual funds and ETFs,” DeMaso said. “If that was the goal, sure, mission accomplished. But that’s a low hurdle.” The suit alleges that Vanguard blocked deals that would have led to performance payments, which represented a “large share” of compensation to JustInvest’s founders. In one instance, JustInvest was close to landing $900 million in assets but Vanguard management allegedly put the kibosh on the deal without an explanation. Before the acquisition, however, Vanguard insisted there would be “lines out the door” for their direct indexing service and that it could help bring in $1 billion in assets to JustInvest on Day 1 alone, according to the complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court. “Indeed, before the merger closed, Vanguard expressed concerns that the security-holders would earn the full performance payments under the agreement too quickly,” the suit said. The complaint also alleges the three founders — Jonathan Hudacko, Vijay Rao, and Alan Cummings — were terminated last year without cause in retaliation for raising concerns. Vanguard declined to comment. Direct Hit. Who can forget when direct indexers were hot commodities in the early 2020s as experts predicted the platforms, which help clients build their own, personalized indexes that come with significant tax advantages, could even take over the ETF industry itself? The laundry list of proud new index shop owners included BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, to name just a few. “[Acquisitions] are not easy, no matter which seat you are in,” DeMaso said. “But this has not been a win-win coming together. Said differently, Vanguard is 0 for 1 on acquisitions … at least from the viewpoint of the acquired.” ETFs targeting the sector are riding high this year due to sustained conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. Growth across the RIA industry remains robust, but AI helps top performers stand apart from the crowd, according to a new Schwab report. The firm said the funding will go toward acquisitions and tech innovation. Lawsuits have been filed against a laundry list of brokerages, including Wells Fargo, LPL and others. The firm is highlighting its potential advantages for advisors who might be on the fence about going to LPL Financial. Thematic and high-fee strategies were some of the more popular index funds among RIAs, according to a new report. They ‘undermine FINRA’s foundational mission of investor protection,’ says the Public Investors Advocate Bar Association. Some worry about adding to the already ballooning national debt, while others applaud extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The proposal is designed to give a larger swath of investors access to private offerings. Economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions have family offices becoming more selective with their allocations, per BlackRock. The Social Security trust funds will only be able to pay out 77% of benefits by 2034, a new report from the administration found. Investors appear to be punishing the muni market, which comprises about 9% of the $47 trillion US bond industry. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Private equity is coming to your 401(k). Are the rewards worth the risk?

In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That may be about to change. Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves. And the Trump Administration is expected to sign an executive order in coming days that would call for federal guidance on adding private investments to 401(k) plans, the Wall Street Journal reports. Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market. Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically high-wealth individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries. Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years. But there’s a reason why wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds. In recent decades, “they actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool. Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks. “Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida. Along with the upside comes a steep downside. Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns. “These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.” The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer, and to do public stock offerings later. Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in a S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said. Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher. “Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature, because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.” Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.” Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund. Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age. Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily. That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out. In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees. Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers. Last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts. “Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote. Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion. “Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO. Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said. The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan said, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments -- or an executive order from Trump. “This will happen over time,” he said, “not overnight.”

Title: “The Corporate Takeover of Housing”

Yves here. It is very hard to know where to begin with this article, since it repeats many tropes about the US housing market that are simply false. The big problem in the US is housing affordability. There is no housing shortage: The total is just short of 148 million. About 35% is rental property, which has a typical vacancy rate of 7%, so one could argue for reducing the total stock by 3.6 million. FRED shows the active listings for owned residences at under 1.1 million; Zillow has the for-sale inventory as of end of June at 1.3 million. Generously (for the purpose of this analysis) using the Zillow figure and assuming all homes listed for sale are not occupied, we get 143.1 million, so say 143 million. The Census put the number of households (admittedly as of 2023) at 127.8 million. So there is no housing shortage on a macro level, as many claim. Now real estate is always and ever local, so there are shortages in certainly chronically underhoused metro areas like New York City, and no doubt in certain other spots. The not-sufficiently-discussed issues are the mismatch in housing stock composition versus needs (particularly the dearth of affordable housing) and the way policy schemes to increase housing affordability, just like the canard of health care “access”, have increased prices and enriched providers. Let’s go through some underlying issues: 1. The breakdown of the traditional model of housing as a forced savings vehicle for retirement. Matt Stoller wrote about this in a law review article: The Housing Crash and the End of AmericanCitizenship. Back in the days when blue collar workers could buy a house, pay for a car in cash, and have a stay-at-home wife, jobs were stable. My father, who changed employers a few times, got raised eyebrows for tenures of less than 10 years. And even if not, labor demand was generally strong enough that a worker had good odds of landing other work in the same community for the same or even better pay. So the 30 year mortgage was a good match for a typical career duration. A worker or professional would buy a home and pay off the mortgage and then live in it at lower cost when he retired. Much shorter employment tenures are the norm. The average US employee has been with their current company only 3.9 years. Changing employers might entail moving, when transaction costs compared to the equity in a house are high. Divorce and disability also lead to home sales rather than staying put until you pay off the mortgage. 2. The US response to lack of housing affordability: to make housing less affordable. Dean Baker wrote about this after the global financial crisis (with worked examples) and was ignored. First buyer subsidies, allowing for more leverage, using government guarantees to lower interest rates allow for greater borrowing when buying homes which over time has helped drive up prices. 3. Zoning and shelter porn have contributed to too much building of too many big houses and not enough “starter homes” of the sort constructed after World War II and more modestly-sized condos and townhouses. This table, although with dated data, presents per capita as opposed to per house data, and gives an even clearer picture of how extravagantly housed (on average) Americans are: Many communities also resist building denser, as in less expensive housing, aka apartments and townhouses. Another zoning contributor has been the end of single room occupancy hotels and boarding houses, where tenants would rent a room and share a bathroom. Some boarding houses offered meals for an additional charge. I had assumed that gentrification was the big driver for the loss of this sort of dwelling. However (and the passage of these laws and regulations may have been part of this gentrification process), in California, and I assume nearly all places, it is illegal to have a housing unit with no bathroom. The argument is that it was a health risk to have a shared bathroom. 4. As Elizabeth Warren outlined in The Two Income Trap, not mentioning how rising income inequality and the loss of inexpensive college education at often very good state schools (government subsidies fell markedly in the 1980s) has led to much greater competition to get into “good” colleges, led in turn to the phenomenon she flagged, of the big premium for housing in “good” and “pretty good” school districts. The article also incorrectly states that “home prices have surged nationwide.” Admittedly this Zillow chart goes back only to 2017. Although “surge” is arguably accurate, the text gives the impression that this is a long-term phenomenon when over the last decade, the frenzied buying during the Covid work from home phenomenon was the big perp. The Zillow chart does show a faster rate of increase, but the table below makes the pattern clearer: The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades. However, it is true that with stagnant real wages, the increase in housing prices can and likely does exceed the increase in average real wages. And that is a huge issue. But that was not the claim made. In addition, the headline claim is incorrect as far as single family homes are concerned. Yes, private equity firms bought foreclosed homes from Fannie and Freddie after the crisis (and not in bulk sales, there was so much interest that the GSE did only “mini-bulks”). We warned at the time that single family homes were not well suited to corporate ownership and property management. They are too diverse in type and construction and too spread out to be managed efficiently. There are no scale factors save at most in rent collection. Consider the corporate owner’s economics versus that of the classic small landlord. He might be an electrician, plumber or carpenter and have someone regular who could perform the tasks beyond his expertise. The houses he owned would be nearby. And he would know their quirks. By contrast, the driving distances alone and the difficulty of managing maintenance staff efficiently works against the owner of dispersed single family homes. Wikipedia notes: According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes, and up to 10 percent in certain metro areas such as Atlanta. Housing researcher Paul Fiorilla, quoted in the Washington Post, stated that it is unlikely that large institutional investors have a significant impact on prices, except for select areas where their concentrations are unusually high: “‘Any segment that owns such a small percentage of the market cannot have that much of an impact on prices,’ with the possible exception of a handful of communities with a significant concentration of big investors.” Some housing advocates have argued that public attention to large institutional investors distracts from structural causes of the housing affordability crisis, such as the housing shortage and its roots in exclusionary zoning and other laws that empower NIMBY obstruction of housing. Indeed. Now to the main event. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute The 2025 U.S. housing market presents a paradox. Home sales are down, and there are far more sellersthan buyers, yet prices continue to hit record highs. Over the past decade, home values have surged nationwide, including in once-affordable Sunbelt cities. Policymakers appear ill-equipped to respond to the situation. In a July 2025 interview with the New York Times, 16 U.S. mayors listed housing as one of their top concerns. During her 2024 presidential campaign, former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed tax credits for first-time buyers to alleviate the crisis, while President Donald Trump has renewed calls for interest rate cuts to help lower mortgage rates. Homeownership remains central to the American dream, and U.S. homeownership rates have typically hovered around 65 percent “from 1965 until 2025,” according to Trading Economics. But the high-water mark came in 2004 when it reached 69 percent, and despite a temporary COVID-19-era spike, the rate has continued to inch downward. Worryingly, even among those who own homes, equity is shrinking. Many homeowners own less than half of their property’s value today, with the balance tied up in debt. Many of the pressures are structural. Construction costs have soared, labor is in short supply, and tariffs have raised the price of materials. Zoning laws, tax regimes, and anti-density regulations have stifled urban growth, while sprawling development is hitting geographic and environmental limits. Mortgage rates remain high, and the national housing shortfall, now estimated to be more than 4.5 million, continues to worsen. But the crisis has opened the door for new kinds of investors. A growing cast of corporate actors is moving into residential real estate, lured by the prospect of stable returns in a tightening market. Though they still own a minority of U.S. housing, these firms are often concentrated in key regions and markets. Increasingly capable of setting the terms of access to housing, their rising influence threatens to reverse the post-World War II surge in widespread homeownership. Buildup Large-scale corporate ownership of homes and influence over rent prices is a relatively recent development. Before 2008, most institutional investors stuck to apartment buildings and urban areas, as single-family homes were seen as too dispersed and costly to manage. That changed after the housing crash, when a wave of foreclosures flooded the market, leading to the availability of deeply discounted homes in the suburbs. “In the decade since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, major institutional financial actors have invested heavily in U.S. single-family housing, acquiring anywhere up to three hundred thousand houses, and then letting them out,” stated a 2021 article in Sage Journals. In 2012, government-backed mortgage giant Fannie Mae began selling thousands of foreclosed homes in bulk to investors, showing single-family housing could be bought, held, and profited from at scale. At the same time, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded support for institutional buyers through favorable financing terms and lower rates. Homebuilding, meanwhile, had collapsed, and a supply shortage began to take hold. “The crash badly hurt a variety of sectors, but it simply devastated the home construction industry, given that the crisis was directly centered there. … with a glut of foreclosures on the market and prices falling fast, America simply stopped building homes. New private home starts plummeted by almost 80 percent to the lowest level since 1959,” according to a 2024 article in the American Prospect. Investor interest surged as home prices recovered in the early 2010s. This era brought record-low interest rates and trillions in financial stimulus from the Federal Reserve and government, which helped stabilize the economy and flooded capital markets. With cheap borrowing and rising prices, housing became an attractive asset. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Remote work drove people from cities to suburbs, while eviction moratoriums pushed many small landlords to sell, opening the door for larger buyers. Digital platforms made it easier to browse, purchase, and manage properties remotely. Alongside traditional banks, a wide range of financial firms and platforms have been profiting from rising demand and tightening supply. Wall Street Landlords Blackstone, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, became a pioneer in large-scale housing acquisitions after 2008. In 2012, it helped launch Invitation Homes, now the largest owner of single-family rentals in the U.S. Though Blackstone sold its stake in 2019, it reentered the market by acquiring Canadian real estate firm Tricon Residential in 2024, and sold 3,000 homes that year to UK’s largest pension fund for approximately $550 million, showcasing its global influence in housing. Other major firms have followed suit. Progress Residential, backed by Pretium Partners, has come under fire for evictions, maintenance failures, and excessive fees. Amherst Holdings was profiled in Fortune in 2019 for using early predictive algorithms to identify and acquire homes, and advances in AI have only made this process more efficient. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), originally designed in the 1960s to give everyday investors access to real estate profits, are now largely dominated by major institutional firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and private equity funds. Invitation Homes agreed to pay $48 million to the Federal Trade Commission in 2024 for junk fees, unfairly holding security deposits, failing to inspect homes, and using improper eviction tactics. Professor Desiree Fields, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 2021, meanwhile, singled out Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent as “particularly vocal about the use of extraneous fees to increase total revenue,” stated a 2022 article in the Charlotte Observer. Corporate homebuying continues to climb. Institutional investors bought 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of 2021, which climbed to nearly 27 percent by early 2025. In some markets, the footprint is even larger: during the third quarter of 2024, investors accounted for 44 percent of all home flips. Some firms, like Rise48 Equity, focus on acquiring and renovating large multifamily buildings to raise rental income and property value. Others, like Amherst Holdings, are beginning to enter the rent-flipping space as part of a larger expansion policy. Unlike smaller flippers who tend to cash out quickly, these companies renovate and hold properties long term. A growing number of companies are focusing on build-to-rent subdivisions, with entire neighborhoods constructed specifically for rentals. No single company dominates nationally, but corporate influence is unmistakable in certain cities. In Atlanta, private equity owns more than 30 percent of single-family rental properties, with corporate ownership disproportionately affecting Black neighborhoods, intensifying housing insecurity and displacement. Large firms enjoy several structural advantages. They access cheaper institutional financing, often pay in cash, and benefit from early access to listings and local policy influence. Firms can use creative financing tools, like combining many homes into a single investment package and using the expected rent payments as collateral to borrow more money. Bulk purchases allow them to cut costs on repairs, insurance, and maintenance, while builders are more inclined to sell homes in large blocks at a discount rather than wait for individual buyers, helping firms to avoid bidding wars. Unlike individual homeowners who often sell for financial reasons, institutional landlords can hold assets for years and sell only when market conditions are favorable. Tax policies further tilt the scales. While individual sellers pay capital gains taxes on home sales, corporate buyers can use the 1031 exchange to defer taxes by reinvesting profits into like-kind properties, pushing tax burdens into the future. Rental property owners also get tax depreciation benefits, which allow them to deduct part of the building’s value each year, reducing their taxes, which compound over time. Tech Big Tech, with similar vast financial resources, has also become essential to the expansion of corporate housing. It enables investors to scale up, manage properties remotely, and influence markets and consumers to their advantage. One of the most influential tools is YieldStar, a rent pricing software developed by RealPage, purchased by private equity firm Thoma Bravo in 2021. RealPage gathers extensive rental data from participating landlords and uses algorithms to recommend optimal prices. Landlords who don’t use the technology are often left at a disadvantage. Many property managers adopt these recommendationsautomatically, often under performance monitoring that discourages underpricing or offering tenant concessions. In cities like Seattle, where a handful of property managers control large shares of the market, RealPage’s pricing influence can be especially powerful. A ProPublica investigation found that in one neighborhood, 70 percent of apartments were handled by 10 firms, all using RealPage software. Recommendations by the software included accepting lower occupancy rates if it leads to higher overall rent revenue. Critics argue that RealPage enables coordinated “rent-setting,” effectively encouraging landlords to behave like a cartel. The U.S. Justice Department opened a lawsuit against the company in 2024 for causing harm to American renters by using its “algorithmic pricing software.” The investigation remains ongoing. At the same time, short-term rental platforms like Airbnb have also reshaped housing. With vast reach and deep legal resources, Airbnb has helped normalize rental conversions and contributed to higher rents in many cities. In 2025, the New York Post reported that the company funded $1 million to alleged grassroots groups, such as Communities for Homeowner Choice, to oppose a New York City law requiring hosts to be present during guest stays. It has also backed tax battles and filed lawsuits across the U.S., challenging occupancy taxes and other local regulations, costing cities millions in legal fees. In both long- and short-term markets, tech platforms have made large-scale rental operations possible. Through pricing tools, political lobbying, and data leverage, housing is emerging as a more managed commodity. As corporate consolidation deepens and larger landlords become more integrated with tech platforms, these companies, and increasingly the property owners themselves, will exert even greater control over rent markets with less transparency or oversight. Addressing the Issue Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including the U.S., now have some of the lowest home ownership rates in the world, and the rise of institutional landlords will drive those numbers lower. The core problem remains supply, with Wall Street firms targeting homes precisely because there’s a shortage—something they openly acknowledge and tout to investors as a profit opportunity. The city of Austin is a rare success story. After peaking at $550,000 in May 2022, median home prices fell to $409,000 by January 2025, and indicators point to a continual downward trend. The key difference has been that Austin has built more affordable housing, providing incentives to ease zoning laws. Homeownership remains most common in rural areas, while urban centers have been hardest hit by rising investor activity and housing scarcity. Public involvement is critical to reducing the problem. Landlord interests, represented by groups like the National Multifamily Housing Council, carry enormous influence, while tenants rely on thinner support networks like the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency play a role, but lag behind corporate influence. In comparison, Blackstone has faced greater resistance in European countries with stronger tenant protections and better-organized renters’ movements. Policies like taxing the unimproved value of land could encourage development and discourage speculation on vacant or underused properties. Without effective measures, the concentration of land in private hands will only grow, whether through corporate landlords, billionaires like Bill Gates (who owns 250,000 acres spread out over 17 states), or creeping attempts to privatize public land. At stake is not just affordability but also whether the public retains any real claim to land and housing or surrenders it entirely to private capital. Is the “housing theory of everything” legit, or some neolib scam? I haven’t looked into it much. I do remember somebody’s-law saying that increasing wages in any region just resulted in the money going to landlords. I’ve made some effort to re-find the article explaining it, without success. I believe this thesis is the essence of Henry George’s Progress and Poverty Mathematically, simplified you have a Markov chain where a house can be in one of two states- 1) owned by noninvestor (e.g. family) 2) owned by investor. the family may sell the house to anyone every few years. the institutional investor does not generally sell and when they do they exchange to another investor in a SFH portfolio. State 2 is an absorbing state-eventually investors will own most properties. Consider this Markov matrix which represents families retaining house/selling to other family 85% and selling home to investor 15% (e.g annually). the investor only sells to a family 2% of the time and keeps/exchanges house to investor 98% of the time. in time, most houses will belong to state 2. 0.85 0.02 0.15 0.98 Theoretically an equilibrium can be maintained if the level of transition is lower than that of the growing number of families buying new construction, but new construction of affordable properties is not high. So it doesn’t happen. That intro by Yves is so cathartic to read but unearths the embittered feelings from my failed ventures. Watching a neighborhood largely get torn down and replaced with mcmansions but not a peep from the city. Meanwhile trying to build a few townhouses kicks off a local war. I’ll admit to feelings of weariness and hatred for the new home buyers. Cities, or their elected officials, are not immune to the benefits of big new houses. They expect more donations and higher tax bases, so the corruption supply and demand stay roughly in balance. Alternatively, there is the new California approach, Pacific Palisades edition. Fire burns down a desirable neighborhood? Use red tape to delay permits and construction. Then use new State funds to buy up targeted lots to build the right kind of new housing. Due process becomes do process to some, doo-doo process to others. Will potential voter increase effect outweigh the impact of the decline in donations. California Assembly is pausing the Palisades land grab bill after citizen input. Everyone, keep contacting your politicians at all levels to let them know what you think about issues and legislation. That provides more hope and voices that can’t be so easily ignored. When home building does happen now, its increasingly swaths of straight to rent subdivisions as the article mentions. Rather than trivial “homestead exemptions”, we need local “non-occupancy taxes”. If the home is not lived in by the owner- a hefty tax ensues. We already have that in most jurisdictions, or as in the case of California, Prop 13 which has somewhat the same effect. (And doing a 1031 exchange won’t prevent a Prop 13 valuation reset AFAIK). Here in Honolulu we have an increased property tax rate on non-owner occupied real property over $1 million, which means pretty much all 4 BR single family detached. I’ve seen articles claiming Gen Z prefers to rent, but it isn’t clear if that’s due to affordability. From a new build perspective, the costs associated with getting government authority to develop seem designed to push for the highest possible price for finished product. We’re mom-and-pop landlords of single family housing. They’re debt-free and if there were mortgages there wouldn’t be much if any cash flow. And for depreciation expense, you’re limited in the amount of net loss you can take for income tax; any excess has to be carried forward until you dispose of the property. Interesting. Thanks! The Zillow price chart to 2017 shows a price increase from 225k to 375k over 8 years. That’s an effective compound average of about 7% a year, is that not higher than CPI? Further, we cannot assume that the median home sold today is the same as that sold 8 years ago. What I’m seeing locally is a lot of homes on the market with issues of mould, termites, structural damage, rodents, etc that sellers don’t want to pay for. I suggest you use the official CPI calculator from the BLS which allows you to select a start and end month. It confirms my statement. You take the start level and month and ask what the future value (as of June 2025 would be. It is higher than the average house price shown by ~5%. https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm Yves, can you share your inputs? I’ve run that same calculator for June 2017 to June 2025 and I clearly get a lower much rate than you’re getting… Oof, I need new glasses. I ran it TWICE last night and misread the end #. Will correct the post. I discounted the look of the chart due to scaling and figured the much discussed Covid surge had been offsite by price stagnation/falls in places people were exiting. A table in this post gives a much clearer picture of what happened. The “surge” is very much due to the Covid WFH buying spike, as in a two year buying frenzy that has stuck (as in most of those who bought at those prices are anchored and won’t sell for less if they do sell): https://bilello.blog/2025/the-ultimate-guide-to-home-price-appreciation Will add it into the main post. The other thing that happened during the covid period is that the price per sqft to build went from approx $200/sqft to $400/sqft. I’ve built and rebuilt (actual banging nails) several houses over the years. Pre covid a Doug Fir 2×4 was about $2. they went as high as $8. Asphalt roofing almost tripled per square (10×10) to install. Price per sqft is still in the upper $300’s… My pet peeve is realtors price older houses (in FL ) the same per sqft as new or late model (Miami/Dade specs).. AND PEOPLE PAY IT !!!! In that cast they’re buying a Yugo for the same price as a Mercedes….. Drives me nuts !!! Well, I count ~3.5% CAGR in inflation from June 30 2017 to June 30 2025, and I also get a little over 6.5% for 225K to 375K… Also, if you look at the Zillow chart closely, it clearly shows a much higher price growth level from mid-2020 to mid-2022, which is the surge people are talking about. It was a 50% surge as far as I can tell eyeballing the graph. And noting that this aggregate hides a distribution, there are surely markets where home prices increased 75-100%. Sure, if you take that surge over a long period and compare to CPI, may or maybe not better. It’s also very likely that references to a surge in “home prices” are imprecise references to home purchase affordability, where a high price has been compounded by higher mortgage rates and higher home insurance premiums even after the technical price surge stopped in mid-2022. If you start with a $225,000 home financed at 80% LTV at 5% in 2017 with $1500 home insurance and 1% property tax, the monthly PITI would be about $1278. If you increase the home value to $375,000, set the interest rate at 7%, and grow the home insurance to $2500, that’s monthly PITI of $2516–just almost double in 8 years. What is not considered here is the attitude of Generation Z members (born after 2000) who now at the age of 25 should be at the age of considering the purchase of first time homes. Unlike generations before them, home ownership is no longer as important as it was. It appears that this generation is keener on spending money on life experience more than previous generations. Hence the rise in tourism, travel and doing cool stuff amongst them. Could it not be that some big business has seen this gap and is catering for it? Complete speculation on my part, but I would argue it’s a chicken/egg issue – Housing is way more expensive, jobs are way shitter, much more precarious (what good is a 30 year mortgage if I’m not even sure I’ll live that long, let alone have a job that long, plus any necessary savings to weather several likely job changes and still cover mortgage), and pay way less. Yet I’m supposed to save up for a 20% down payment to incur a long term liability for an asset that I may not be able to hold on to? Eff that. I may as well spend what little money I have on something I will enjoy and will make existence slightly less shitty. It’s not that Gen Z or Millennials don’t want their own place – the drive to own a house in the US is strong and deep – no cultural history of multi generational family living together, unlike say Italy. Given the opportunity, who wouldn’t want their own place to make your own / live in / get laid in without having to deal with parents? It’s just that prices are obscene, and it’s not realistic, given the difficulty of obtaining stable, high paid work, to even consider purchasing. So you either rent and try to live your life, or live with Mom and Dad if that’s an option, and take it day to day. Ownership, one of the few ways to guard against getting screwed over, is still just as important…just not attainable. Maybe I’m reading it wrong. Apologies if so. I think this is a fairly accurate assessment. You can see this reflected in young people’s voting patterns being towards candidates that promise to improve affordability of homes. Trump was vocal about this with interest rate policy, and in the recent Canadian election many young people believed Pierre Poillevre would make homes more affordable. The drive to own a home is still there, but most younger people have jobs that aren’t paying enough to achieve that. There’s a huge divide in young people’s affordability depending on career paths out of highschool. Those who went into trades, specialized medical fields, or engineering fields are doing well. Those who went into other fields are struggling to find well paying jobs. I do think there’s an aspect of financial illiteracy as well, but I’ve seen the above in kids from wealthier parents who you would think would pass it on. I agree with you, but wanted to add a little bit of shading regarding one point. “Financial Literacy” in this context has multiple layers, none of which bode well for the younger set. 1. Financial literacy generally is not taught in schools, and especially not primary school. Math certainly is (quality notwithstanding), but its application to the real world is incredibly limited. That this is beneficial to multiple companies and entities that subsist on predatory behavior and ill-advised financial decisions may or may not have direct bearing but they certainly benefit. 2. Even if kids get some literacy, it takes time and experience to develop any kind of savvy, if they ever do. Couple this with the fact that financial products GENERALLY are far more complex than they were 70 years ago, and contain much more in the way of weasel behavior and awful traps (as neoliberal norms have allowed them to flourish – decent social behavior from a corporation is largely a financial liability), you basically have to get screwed a couple times to realize where the pitfalls are. Only as you age do you recognize these old wolves in new sheep skins. 3. Even being well-to-do is no guarantee. Providing a good financial education, as a parent, to a child, is incredibly difficult. It took me years to educate myself financially, and I’m still only halfway there, not to mention any terrible habits and stupid behavior that I’m still struggling with. I wouldn’t know where to start with a young child. Better than nothing, sure, but not ace, either. 4. Becoming financially literate, or at least practicing at financial literacy, requires…you know…finances. Excess finances. Buying in bulk, for example, or even being able to say no and walk away from something obviously bad necessitates having some amount of leverage. In many cases that leverage is money, or some equivalent. Many studies have shown that poor people, when given direct cash payments, are remarkably rational and spend money in the ways that are most beneficial in the longer term. When you have no excess cash, though, the most rational decision is usually the one that keeps your kids fed, or the lights on, or a roof over your head. After all that, if I only have $20 left, I may as well buy some smokes because it won’t do shit for future planning. Having no excess cash is basically like running your life using lean principles and JIT inventory. The mildest setback is usually a complete disaster. Congress can disallow corporate landlord income tax write-offs for interest and depreciation on SFH and multi-units less than 13.. Problem solved. Could you explain how that would work for REITs? I agree that this post which Yves vivisected falls far short of making its argument after she discredited some of its claims: “According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes…” That alone crumbles the key stone holding up the post’s headline and themes. However, I believe corporations and private equity do create a significant effect on the cost of housing through their investments in apartments and their activities colluding to drive up rents. My only warrant in making this claim is my own feelings of powerlessness as a renter. Moving is an ordeal. Landlords often have tenants at their mercy as they raise rents as I have experienced renting an apartment from a corporation and as a private equity firm bought a little duplex where I lived some years later. I have always wanted to own my own home but my work and life situation made home ownership too costly. I have often had to move across the country to follow jobs. The squeeze on rents, availability of rentals in many urban areas, and orders to move following the sale of the apartments where I lived only added to my desire to own my own home. In comparing rents to monthly mortgage payments, the increasing cost of rents, persistent rent increases, and threat of being moved out to accommodate gentrification added to my demand to own my own home and my willingness to increase how much I might pay for that home. I believe corporate land speculation added with the land speculation by the 10% who have captured the share of earnings growth that might have accrued to the lower 90% helped drive up land prices. The upper 10% have more directly added to the price of homes through their purchases of second homes in otherwise relatively affordable areas. In the small city where I have been looking for a home, I drive by many homes on large, often elegant properties that appear unoccupied most of the year. I believe corporate employment practices helped grow the income spread between the upper 10% and the lower 90%. The COVID work-from-home policies added to this pressure and housing outside urban centers. I doubt the apartments previously occupied by the 10% came down in rent enough to help many in the lower 90%. The cost of land leads to the tendency for developers to build relatively expensive McMansions on postage stamp lots. Builders must build more expensive homes, which usually means bigger, grander homes, on smaller lots to get the most return. Apartments with affordable rents, even when allowed, do not yield sufficient returns, especially as the cost of getting loans to finance the purchase of more expensive land, labor, and materials to build housing. “The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades.” I tend to view this as indication that housing prices have reached a point where home buyers are nearing the maximum amount of their income that they can afford to spend on housing. The changes in interest rates and the current tendency for loan agents to look askance at less than 20% down and buyers who would be paying more than a third of their income to pay for housing. I believe this post is too anxious to find a single cause for the high cost of housing in America. Nixon stopped the feds from building affordable housing, and Reagan cut HUD’s affordable housing budget by 75%. Homelessness surged to levels not seen since before the New Deal. Surprise! I fight a constant uphill battle in the public discourse (here in near proximity to Toronto) trying to get people to understand that the abdication by governments (at all levels) of the responsibility for building low income housing almost 40 years ago is directly related to the homelessness and housing affordability crises. “The market” never has, and never will, build sufficient low income housing — there’s no money in it! But neoliberalism has eaten almost everyone’s brains, so I am making little to no progress … 😒 Yep. And remember, Nixon’s act followed LBJ’s civil rights legislation that would have given people of color access to those affordable homes. Your email address will not be published.

Title: ‘Be single-minded’: Cork hurling heroes of 1966 on what it takes to end an All-Ireland drought

It may have been a Tipperary man who first popularised the use of “famine” to describe a dearth of hurling success, but few Cork people listening to Borris-Ileigh’s Richard Stakelum as he lifted the Munster Senior Hurling Cup in 1987 would ever thought it would one day apply to them. At that stage, Cork led the All-Ireland roll of honour with 26 titles, three ahead of Kilkenny and four ahead of Tipperary. The idea that the Rebels would experience a 16-year barren stretch was unfathomable to most on Leeside. The Rebels have remained consistent in Munster, but they have endured a long wait for an All-Ireland that stretches back to 2005. From the 1890s up to that point in 1987, Cork had won at least one All-Ireland every decade. With the peerless Christy Ring to the fore, they won five titles in the 1940s followed by three in the 1950s. The dry period between Cork’s All-Ireland wins in 1903 to 1919 stands out as a particular disappointment. However, that was ancient history by 1987. For Cork fans born in the 1920s, the halcyon days of the 1940s and the first half of the 1950s surely looked like they would never end. Until they did. “Those were the days,” as Mary Hopkin sang over a decade later. Cork’s failure to reach All-Ireland finals for a decade following the 1956 loss to Wexford meant fans were desperate for success when a young team finally made it back to Croke Park in 1966. That 1966 team offers the closest example in living memory of what the current Cork team are facing into this Sunday when they take on the Premier County in the All-Ireland final. The current crop of Rebel hurlers will be seeking to prove that famines – even 20-year famines, in their case – do eventually end. But unlike this year’s team, who go into Sunday’s final as most people’s favourites, the Cork team that entered Croke Park for the 1966 decider were rank outsiders and featured several under-21 players. Among them were the three McCarthys, who were all unrelated. Gerald and Charlie hurled with St Finbarr’s, while Justin hurled with Passage. This week, all three looked back on a day that earned them and their teammates a particular place in Cork hurling lore. Coming up against a seasoned Kilkenny outfit who had beaten Waterford just three years earlier to win the All-Ireland, that young Cork side ran out 3-09 to 1-10 winners. Colm Sheehan from Éire Óg netted two goals and John O’Halloran from Blackrock bagged a third . The three McCarthys also played their part. Justin, who was 21, lined out at midfield, contributing two-second half points. Gerald, also 21, captained the team from left half-forward and Charlie (20) lined out at right corner-forward. Each chipped in with a point. Justin recalls that while Cork had gone over a decade without an All-Ireland, it was no great burden to the team. “I think we were conscious that it had been 12 years,” he said. “We had all grown up seeing Cork winning in 1952, ‘53 and ‘54, and of course the loss to Wexford in ‘56. I suppose that gave us all an urgency to want to play for Cork and a lot of lads on the panel had experienced the lean years. [ Three Munster finals that created the mythos of Tipperary v CorkOpens in new window ] “We knew it was important to Cork, but a lot of us were very young. There was a blend of youth with Gerald and Charlie and Seanie Barry and myself, and there were older fellows on the team like Peter Doolan and Paddy Fitzgerald and Tom O’Donoghue and Denis Murphy. “None of us had ever played in an All-Ireland final before, but we were quite confident – we had beaten Clare after a replay and then Limerick and Waterford in the Munster championship, and we were well geared up and we were quite confident going in that we could beat them. “Gerald and myself were rooming together and I remember that morning, as we were going to Mass, he said to me, ‘we have a good chance’. I said, ’we have, and we’ll have that cup in this room this evening’. We had no fear.” Similarly, Gerald McCarthy acknowledged that they were all conscious of Cork’s 12-year barren run. He said: “There’s always an expectation in Cork – the fans nearly demand success. But in fairness, it wasn’t being overdone by people. We didn’t have fellows coming up to us on the street and saying ‘it’s 12 years’ or that sort of thing. We were a young team and people recognised that. [ Cork crowds, Tipp trips, Munster mastery: Seven-step guide to the 2025 hurling championshipOpens in new window ] “Okay, there was a bit of pressure, but I think when you are young, you can deal with it better. We had played Kilkenny in the league semi-final in Croke Park earlier that year, but we didn’t have a semi-final after winning Munster, so it was our first championship match in Croke Park. “So, we didn’t have any real experience of Croke Park, certainly not a crowd that size. We were a good mix of young and experience, but I think the younger players just took it on. When you are young, you don’t take in the whole impact of it and can deal with it better than an old stager. “I remember as we were going in from Lucan to Croke Park on the bus, The Beatles had a hit with Yellow Submarine and somebody started singing ‘We All Live in a Red Submarine’. It just clicked and everyone fell in with it and it just broke the tension, so we handled that well.” Charlie MacCarthy says it helped Cork that Kilkenny were such favourites to win. “We went into the game without any one really giving us a chance,” he said. “It’s a bit like Sunday with Tipp, nobody is giving them a chance. I was only a young fellow, just turned 20 and the attitude was, ‘we have nothing to lose, we’ll go up there and give it our best shot’. “And in fairness, everybody got stuck in and stuck in early. We really didn’t give Kilkenny a chance to settle down – our backs were very good, very tight and we got our goals at the right time and it settled us. We kept plugging away and things turned out right for us in the end.” Gerald acknowledges that Cork are going into Sunday’s game as favourites but says players can react in different ways to being favourites and the pressure it may bring. “The pressure can affect your head, but everyone is different and you have to learn to deal with it somehow.” Charlie thinks it will be a tight game, but feels that Cork might shade it, especially as they are driven by the pain of losing last year’s All-Ireland final to Clare. “I think it will be close enough,” he said. ”The Tipp lads are after improving since the League final and the round-robin game and they battled back well against Kilkenny in the semi-final, so it will be close. But I have a slight fancy for Cork and think they will shade it.” As for Justin, his advice to the current wearers of the jersey is forget about history and simply go out and hurl. He agrees that the desire to make amends for last year’s narrow loss to Clare could help drive them on “Yes, they have a chance now to redeem themselves for last year. That’s a good motivation but forget about 20 years – you can think about that afterwards when you win. It’s all on the day and you just have to be single-minded and go out with the belief you are good enough to win it.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Global agribusiness giants are seizing Ukraine’s fertile farmland

Key points: Ukraineâs "chernozem" soilâamong the most fertile in the worldâis being rapidly acquired by foreign corporations as Ukrainian farmers struggle amid war and displacement. IMF pressure forced Ukraine to lift a land-sale moratorium in 2020, opening the door for agribusiness giants to buy up vast tracts of farmland. Major investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, alongside agribusiness corporations, now control nearly 28% of Ukraineâs arable land. Ukrainian labor and regulatory loopholes allow these corporations to exploit cheap labor, banned fertilizers, and GMO cropsâpractices illegal in the EU. If Ukraine joins the EU, these corporations could flood Europe with cheap, deregulated crops, decimating local farmers while pocketing taxpayer-funded subsidies. The great land grab: How corporations are colonizing Ukraine Ukraineâs black earth, known as chernozem, is a national treasure, possessing nearly a quarter of the worldâs richest soil. Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests. The Oakland Instituteâs explosive 2023 report reveals a stark reality: foreign agribusinesses now dominate Ukrainian farmland, operating through shell companies in tax havens like Cyprus and Luxembourg. Entities like NCH Capitalâbacked by U.S. pension funds and university endowmentsâare buying up land at unprecedented rates. Worse still, Ukrainian oligarchs have sold off shares to Western banks, turning food security into just another Wall Street commodity. "They donât care about feeding peopleâthey care about controlling the food supply," warns AndrÃ¡s Tibor Cseh, a Hungarian agricultural expert. "Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice zone for global agribusiness." Deregulation warfare: How GMOs and banned chemicals flood Ukraine While EU farmers must comply with strict environmental laws, Ukraine has become a deregulated playground for agribusiness. Half the fertilizers used in Ukraine are already banned in Europe, yet corporations like Monsantoâblocked from operating in the EU due to GMO bansâsee Ukraine as an open frontier for genetic experimentation. With labor costs four times lower than Hungary and no animal welfare laws, Ukraine is a corporate dreamland. "There are no rules," says Cseh. "They grow whatever they want, poison the soil, and then sell the contaminated grain abroad." This toxic harvest isnât just a Ukrainian problemâthese cheap, deregulated crops will soon flood European markets, undercutting local farmers while filling corporate coffers. The EU membership trap: A corporate takeover in disguise The ultimate goal? Fast-tracking Ukraine into the EU, giving agribusiness giants duty-free access to 450 million consumers. Once inside the EU, these corporations will grab even more land while pocketing billions in farm subsidiesâpaid for by European taxpayers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmersâmany of whom opposed the land reformsâare being pushed aside. As land transactions surge post-invasion, foreign entities exploit legal loopholes, even bypassing Ukrainian citizenship rules through presidential decrees. "Theyâre not just buying landâtheyâre buying influence," warns the Oakland Institute. With thousands of lobbyists in Brussels, these corporations are ensuring Ukraineâs EU accession benefits them, not local farmers. If BlackRock, Monsanto, and Saudi investors can bleed Ukraine dry during wartime, theyâll do the same anywhere else. This isnât just about Ukraineâitâs about who controls the global food supply. Once these corporations monopolize farmland, they dictate prices, production, and even policy.

Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests.

Title: More pain for would-be buyers as price of a typical home rises by €35,000 in a year

Report reveals the areas with highest and lowest price increases It's more bad news for those looking to get on the housing ladder. Stock image: Getty The cost of a typical property has shot up by €35,000 in the past year, putting a renewed squeeze on home buyers. Prices jumped again in May, the 21st month in a row of rising home values. In the last five years, buyers have had to pay an additional €74,000 to secure a home. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May. This is up from 7.6pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc, compared with May last year. The median, or typical, price of a dwelling bought in May was €370,000, up €5,000 on the median price in April. A typical property is now €74,000 more expensive than in May 2020, when the median price was €296,000, according to a deep dive into CSO data. The highest median price for a dwelling in May this year was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May this year, 3,824 home ­purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time-buyer purchases in May. The area outside of Dublin with the largest growth in house prices was the border region, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices rose an average of 10pc in the mid-west, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the south-east – comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford – had a 7.7pc rise in house prices. The Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late Independent economist Austin Hughes said the latest price surge suggested the need for somewhere to live remained a more important factor than nervousness about tariffs and trade wars. He said it was notable that the monthly increase in Dublin prices of 0.7pc exceeded that of the rest of the country. It was the first time since September that price rises in the capital were ahead of those outside of it. Property sales in the capital were 14pc higher in the first five months of this year compared to the same period last year, but sales in the rest of the country are slightly lower. “So, the Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late, possibly reflecting the impact of lower interest rates as well as relatively strong income growth,” he said. Mr Hughes said that, so far, there was little sign of any notable fallout from multinational tariff fears on the home sales market in the capital. This week, the Economic and ­Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there would be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said the Government was to miss its targets in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels meant the outlook for housing remained bleak.
