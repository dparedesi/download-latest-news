Polymarket predicts high chances of XRP ETF approval amid Ripple's SEC settlement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Optimism around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is rising as Ripple edges closer to the end of its long-standing legal clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 26, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, sparked fresh discussion around the possibility of an XRP ETF. He suggested that regulatory approval might be closer than expected, especially with Ripple’s courtroom challenges nearing resolution. Geraci expressed confidence that once the path clears, heavyweight asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity could offer XRP-based investment products. BlackRock and Fidelity are the world’s leading asset management firms, managing more than $15 trillion in assets cumulatively. The two firms have significant exposure to the crypto industry, with their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominating the market. Geraci’s optimism is rooted in XRP’s strong market presence. Currently, it ranks as the third-largest non-stablecoin crypto by market capitalization—a position likely to draw institutional interest. According to him: “XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Market sentiment supports this outlook. Crypto bettors on the decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket have placed heavy bets on an XRP ETF approval, assigning it an 86% probability of getting SEC clearance by the end of 2025. The recent rise in confidence follows key developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the financial regulator. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had withdrawn its appeal, marking a turning point in the multi-year legal standoff. On March 25, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the company would pay a $50 million fine and drop its cross-appeal against the regulator. A key component of the proposed resolution includes lifting a court order that previously barred Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. However, this action still awaits SEC Commissioner approval and a green light from the court. Despite concerns over tighter regulatory oversight, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz clarified that the settlement does not alter the company’s core legal position. According to him, Ripple will continue operating under its current framework, with the lifting of the injunction being only one of several developments likely to take shape under the SEC’s new leadership.

Title: BlackRock BUIDL expands into Solana – Is this what SOL needs to beat ETH?

Is BlackRock’s move to Solana a signal that Ethereum is losing ground? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is strengthening its foothold in the crypto sector by expanding its blockchain-based money market fund to Solana [SOL]. In collaboration with its technology partner Securitize, BlackRock has introduced a new share class of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL) on SOL’s network. This move comes a year after the fund’s initial launch and highlights BlackRock’s continued push into tokenized finance. By integrating BUIDL into Solana’s ecosystem, investors can now leverage the network’s low transaction costs and instant settlement capabilities. Remarking on the same, Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said, “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Adding to the fray was Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, who noted, “Solana is uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of adoption for tokenized real-world assets due to the network’s speed, low costs and active developer ecosystem. Blackrock’s expansion of BUIDL on Solana offers users a network that balances innovation with the operational efficiency the industry demands.” BlackRock’s expansion of its BUIDL fund to Solana comes amid a significant increase in its Ethereum [ETH] holdings, which have surged to a record $1.145 billion. In fact, Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, recently reinforced his bullish outlook on SOL in an interview with Frank Chaparro. On the other hand, Samani also raised critical concerns about ETH’s roll-up-centric scaling approach, questioning its long-term viability. His remarks reflect the ongoing debate between Solana and Ethereum among industry leaders and who is going to outpace the other. That being said, Solana’s dominance over Ethereum remains evident across key metrics such as DEX trading volume, user activity, and transaction fees. While its fee advantage briefly narrowed in February, Solana has consistently maintained a multi-million-dollar lead since early January. Seeing this, analysts at Delphi Digital predict that this trend could extend into 2025, positioning SOL as the top Layer 1 blockchain. Additionally, on the price front, SOL continues to outperform, recently rising 3.83% to $144.51, while ETH saw a modest 0.87% increase to $2,069.30. Therefore, with strong momentum and sustained growth, Solana’s competitive edge over Ethereum appears poised to strengthen further.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China as Golden Ticket to Quietly Operate in Panama Canal

DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies—Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping, and Grandest Shipping—all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multimillion-dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show. China’s presence in the Panama Canal has allowed Iran to take its business to the Western Hemisphere right under the nose of the U.S. “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade U.S. sanctions.” The U.S.’ ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called shadow fleets that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The Belt and Road Initiative has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, American investment giant BlackRock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the U.S. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So, it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Trump Pick for Panama Envoy: Chinese Influence Goes Beyond the Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2025/03/26/trump-pick-for-panama-envoy-chinese-influence-goes-beyond-the-canal/

Kevin Cabrera, President Donald Trump’s nomination as the next U.S. ambassador to Panama, said Tuesday during his confirmation hearing in Congress that China’s influence in Panama extends beyond the canal’s ports. Cabrera explained to Congress that China exerts influence in Panama’s higher education system through Confucius Institute agreements that China signed with all five local universities. Confucius Institutes are academic organizations entirely controlled by the Chinese regime that spread communist ideology and propaganda to teachers and students at international universities. The first such Confucius Institute in Panama was inaugurated in June 2018 during the administration of former Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela — one year after the Central American nation cut ties with Taiwan and simultaneously embraced the Chinese Communist Party’s “One-China Principle,” which states that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a “province” of China. Additionally, Cabrera detailed that China has inked agreements with Panama’s State Radio and Television System (SERTV), pointing out that the state media system “definitely never criticizes China.” “But again, I think that the Chinese influence is not just in the canal. It’s also in other areas. I know that they have memorandums of understanding with all five public universities in Panama for Confucius centers,” Cabrera said. “And they also have a relationship with the local government-owned TV, SERTV, where they provide information, which many times is put in an uncritical, it definitely never criticizes China, what goes on, the information they pass along.” Cabrera told Congress that, if confirmed as ambassador, he will work alongside President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee to continue to diminish Chinese influence in Panama while providing opportunities for American investment in the Central American nation. Additionally, Cabrera expressed his concern on the use of Chinese technology used in Panamanian infrastructure and listed the implementation of Chinese-made security cameras in the city of north-central city of Colón — where the Atlantic Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal is located — and the use of Chinese-made cranes in Colón’s port of Manzanillo, operated by a subsidiary of the Washington-based Carrix marine terminal and rail yard operators company. Cabrella stressed that the use of Chinese cameras and equipment could compromise cybersecurity and access to sensitive information. “We have seen how Chinese state-owned companies can bid significantly lower prices in tenders to ensure that governments buy their technology, Cabrera reportedly said. “This raises questions about who controls the information and whether these infrastructures can be manipulated.” President Trump started an ongoing debate over the Panama Canal in December after he expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships and because of the growing influence of China in the important trade route. Control of the Panama Canal, which the United States built, was handed over to Panama in 1999 as per the terms of an agreement signed by both nations in 1977 during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Over the past months, President Mulino, officials from the Panama Canal Authority, and other Panamanian government authorities have repeatedly refuted President Trump’s claims and denied any Chinese influence in the Canal. Mulino has also insisted that his administration will not engage in any talks with the United States pertaining to the control of the Panama Canal. Cabrera stressed to Congress that both President Trump and Secretary Rubio have identified possible violations of Article IV of the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty signed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, which states that the U.S. and Panama agree to maintain a regime of neutrality in the Panama Canal so that it remain “permanently neutral.” Cabrera identified the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale to BlackRock of its subsidiary that currently operates two ports at the Panama Canal as a positive step in reducing Chinese influence in the country. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday morning that despite China’s “anger” over the transaction, CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale of the two Panama Canal ports to BlackRock is “moving ahead as scheduled.” Christian K.

Asset manager Fidelity Investments is reportedly preparing to launch its own stablecoin. The Boston-based company, which manages more than $5 trillion in assets, is in the advanced stages of testing the coin, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (March 25), citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the report, the planned launch is part of Fidelity’s expansion into the burgeoning market for tokenized versions of US Treasuries. The report adds that the company has also recently filed to introduce a digital version of a U.S. money market fund at the end of May, which would put it in competition with rival asset management groups BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As the report notes, Fidelity is making these efforts at a time when federal regulators are changing their attitude toward cryptocurrencies in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election last year. Trump had embraced crypto on the campaign trail — marking a contrast with the stricter approach by the Biden White house — and has pledged to promote the growth of dollar-backed stablecoins. There is also a pair of stablecoin bills before Congress. Fidelity published a report earlier this year arguing that central banks and world governments would be among the next “significant investors” in bitcoin. That report noted that while many countries hold bitcoin, it is typically through government seizures and recoveries from criminal prosecutions. Many governments also have rules for the selling or handling of this bitcoin and can’t list them as part of their treasury. “We expect 2025 to be the year this changes for both acceptance and adoption,” wrote Fidelity’s Matt Hogan. “This is to say, we anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin.” Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about use cases for stablecoins beyond crypto market liquidity, with applications that include cross-border payments. “Traditional international transactions remain slow and expensive, burdened by correspondent banking networks and legacy financial systems,” that report said. “Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, promise a faster and cheaper alternative. By leveraging blockchain rails, stablecoins can bypass intermediaries, facilitating near-instantaneous settlements at potentially lower costs.” For the Outlook 2030 B2B event at the end of last year, PYMNTS spoke with Ran Goldi, SVP, payments and network at Fireblocks, and Nikola Plecas, Visa Crypto’s head of commercialization, to explore the benefits and myths surrounding blockchain-based payments. This included a discussion of the concept of the “stablecoin sandwich,” a method of using stablecoins to transfer value between currencies, which helps illustrate blockchain’s efficiency in cross-border transactions.

The March dip attracted massive buyers as over $470M SOL were withdrawn from exchanges. Fidelity, a $15 trillion asset manager, has joined the U.S. spot Solana [SOL] exchange-traded funds (ETF) race. On the 25th of March, the firm filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), via Cboe BZX exchange for a spot SOL ETF. Only BlackRock was yet to make a similar application. But Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck had done so. The market’s expectation for approval was high, at 86% per Polymarket. In fact, in February, the agency acknowledged all the filings and subsequently entered them into the Federal Register (FR), triggering the 240-day window for an approval decision. As of this writing, Franklin Templeton’s filing was yet to hit the FR. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s move was expected after registering a trust in Delaware on the 20th of March, a common pathway for issuers eyeing a new ETF filing. After recent ETF futures approval and a subsequent debut on CME Futures, SOL was the top contender in the altcoin ETF lineup. Other altcoins like Litecoin [LTC], Polkadot [DOT], Avalanche [AVAX], Sui [SUI], and Dogecoin [DOGE] also saw ETF interest amongst issuers. However, Nate Geraci of ETF Store projected that the agency might not greenlight all altcoin ETFs. “Optimistic on approval of various altcoin ETFs (but SEC will likely draw line somewhere). Quite a bit of debate around whether advisors want broad crypto exposure ETFs vs targeting single crypto ETFs. I’m bullish on broad crypto ETFs.” On markets, speculators betted on the altcoin’s price upside. Notably, over the past seven days, holders withdrew approximately $70M of SOL from exchanges, signaling bullish expectations for the future. Source: Coinglass Coinglass data showed that over $470M SOL was moved from exchanges in the past three weeks alone. The demand triggered the altcoin to bounce nearly 30% from the March low of $112. However, bulls had to clear the $150 hurdle to climb higher, or short sellers could regain the market edge.

Title: Best Crypto Presales to Watch as BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin

Bitcoin may be taking a breather, but behind the scenes, the giants are quietly stacking chips. The latest move? BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has launched a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe called iShares Bitcoin ETP. Yes, the same BlackRock whose IBIT fund in the US made waves as one of the most successful Bitcoin ETF launches in history. When the whales start swimming, minnows take notice, and it’s not Bitcoin alone that’s attracting attention. We look at three of the best crypto presales that investors have been flocking to, but first, more about what BlackRock’s been up to. BlackRock doesn’t just toss darts. Their latest European Bitcoin ETP follows the roaring success of IBIT, which quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history. This isn’t a side hustle. It’s a signal. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, once called Bitcoin an ‘index of money laundering.’ Now, he’s all in. If that’s not a 180, we don’t know what is. And as BlackRock expands its crypto exposure into Europe, it tells us one thing: the institutional floodgates aren’t just open – they’re flooding. Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbon is an on-chain metric that tracks Bitcoin miners’ health and behavior. When it flips bullish, it usually means miners have stopped panic-selling and started hoarding coins again. Historically, it’s been a sure sign of an incoming rally. So, with BlackRock going full steam ahead on $BTC, and technical indicators flashing green, what’s the smart money move? Just before the next $BTC rally, Bitcoin is always the big play. But those who caught Ethereum in 2016 or Dogecoin in 2020 know the biggest gains can come through smaller players if you get in while they’re still small. So, let’s talk about some of the new kids on the blockchain, three of the best crypto presales you’ll want on your radar before the rocket takes off: If BlackRock is the heavyweight champ in the Bitcoin arena, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an ambitious contender with serious crowd appeal. At its core, $BTCBULL is a reflection-based token that aims to amplify exposure to Bitcoin. When the price of $BTC moves up, $BTCBULL is designed to react even stronger – thanks to its tokenomics and smart contract mechanics. That means you’re not just betting on Bitcoin. You’re turbocharging the bet. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.00243, and the project has already raised over $4.1M in presale. That’s no small feat for a token that hasn’t even hit the main exchanges yet. There’s more under the hood. One of the token’s standout features is its Bitcoin airdrop system. As Bitcoin hits key milestones – $125K, $150K, and beyond – holders of $BTCBULL will receive $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops. But there’s a catch: airdrops are only distributed to those who bought $BTCBULL via Best Wallet and continue holding it there. If you’re holding your tokens somewhere else, even in a cold wallet, you’ll miss the party. So if you’re chasing those juicy $BTC rewards, make sure you’re in the right wallet and ready for the next breakout. Next up is Meme Index ($MEMEX) – a token that could only exist in 2025. Picture this: what if there were a single index token that tracked the performance of top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe? That’s exactly what Meme Index is. Meme Index is made up of four unique indexes: Meme Titan, Meme MidCap, Meme Moonshot, and Meme Frenzy. Each one targets a different layer of the meme coin market, from established giants to up-and-coming underdogs and ultra-volatile moonshots. The platform uses automated smart contracts to track, weigh, and rebalance the top meme coins based on market cap and liquidity. $MEMEX holders automatically gain diversified exposure to the meme coin market – no active trading required. It’s meme investing made passive. If Dogecoin taught us anything, it’s that memes can turn into gold. $MEMEX isn’t just banking on it – it’s systematizing it. It might sound like a meme, but the index structure makes it a surprisingly smart play. You get exposure to the meme coin space, without having to put all your eggs in the Doge basket. In the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, Dawgz AI ($DAWGZ) is making waves by merging the playful essence of meme culture with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Dawgz AI is an AI agent that stands out by offering powerful, automated AI trading bots designed to scan, analyze, and trade the crypto markets 24/7. These bots aren’t just fast – they’re trained on real-time data and refined by continuous machine learning to optimize decision-making and maximize returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone who panics during market dips, Dawgz AI aims to take the stress out of trading. The platform also includes an intuitive dashboard for monitoring performance and a suite of tools that lets you customize risk levels, strategies, and even tap into community-voted bot upgrades. The goal? Make AI-driven trading simple, efficient, and fun. $DAWGZ is currently in presale at $0.00345, and the project has already raised nearly $3M, reflecting strong investor confidence in the idea of democratizing AI trading. Let’s be real – Bitcoin isn’t going to zero. Not when BlackRock’s buying in. Not when miners are hoarding. And definitely not when the Hash Ribbon flashes bullish like it just did. But while $BTC is gearing up for its next leg up, the smartest money often finds the breakout stars before they hit the headlines. So whether you’re into altcoins, or just hunting for the best presale of 2025, now’s the time to act. Because once the market starts running again, hesitation will be the most expensive decision of all. As always, don’t forget to do your own research (DYOR) – crypto investments are highly volatile and carry risks, especially during presales. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. 03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ...

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

Title: With 600 mile range and $9K price, maybe it really SHOULD be the new Model 2

The SGMW Wuling Hongguang EV offers Chinese car buyers five or seven-seat configurations, 300 km of range (that’s about 185 miles to you and me), and a $9,600 price tag – but it’s the 1000 km EREV version that would take the US by storm in 2025. Context: this is an opinion/satire piece, so get that out of the way and have some fun. Despite the fact that we still have the same POTUS we did in 2020 and that familiar sense of impeding, civilization-wide collapse has never quite went away after David Bowie died and they shot the gorilla, the automotive world has changed quite a bit since Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced an affordable, $25,000 Tesla “Model 2” at the company’s now infamous 2020 Battery Day event. Back then, it seemed like just about every automaker this side of the Pacific was announcing plans to go “fully electric” by 2030 or 2035 or whatever in a cynical bid to emulate TSLA and its trillion-dollar market cap. It’s 2025 now, the shareholder cash grab didn’t take, and Toyota’s pocket Senator Joe Manchin succeeded in advancing the company’s “hybrids are electric” cause by lowering the rebate floor for battery-powered vehicles to just 7 kWh. With batteries still being the limiting reagent in America’s EV reaction, the name of the game now is plug-in hybrids and EREVs – and with Musk buddying to the Indian and Chinese governments, US oil lobbyists, and hoping to sell more cars to a cash-strapped middle America, the timing feels right for an affordable EREV Tesla. This is the one. Eggs are still $9 here in Chicago, despite what Chester Cheetah promised on the campaign trail. Rent is still high, and utility prices are about to start creeping up, too. What’s more, there are currently zero new cars with an MSRP below $20,000 for sale in the US, where the average transaction price for a new vehicle has crept up to $48,039 (more than the median annual income at the last census, by the way). The time is right, in other words, for Tesla to roll out a car exactly like the SGMW Wuling Hongguang EREV. And by “exactly like,” I mean exactly. Like. This is how I think a multinational Wuling Tesla rebadge Model 2 could work, and benefit all of Elon’s other plans: If you squint, the Wuling Hongguang already looks like it might the 7/8 scale offspring of a first-gen Model Y and a Kia Rondo. Heck, Tesla might not even have to change the logo because: how many Tesla logos have they really seen in South Dakota, you know? It wouldn’t even be the first time Tesla (or its CEO) repurposed someone else’s engineering and put their name on it. The original Tesla Roadster was essentially a re-powered Lotus Elise with a body kit, wasn’t it? Tesla is a "tech" company that marks itself as the "Apple" of cars, meaning it is exorbitantly priced, filled with fancy gadgetry and thus expensive. What the public needs and can afford is a very basic no-frills shoebox design daily-driver moving at flow-of-traffic crawl speed. Of course it was, and this new Tesla Model 2 could be just as great, thanks to a rear-wheel drive layout paired with a relatively low-weight, sport-tuned chassis and 200 combined hp from its 1.5L range extender and 75 kW electric motor. The 8.5 kWh DCFC-capable lithium iron phosphate battery pack is good for about 35 miles (50 km) of all-electric range – but they’ll sell the car’s 1,000 km “total range.” It might even have more genuine performance cred than this LeMans-inspired French cargo van, and that thing costs over $50K!

Title: Exploring Telecom's Four Strategic Options For Navigating Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/03/26/exploring-telecoms-four-strategic-options-for-navigating-change/
Time Published: 2025-03-26T11:45:00Z

ByClaudio Saes ByClaudio Saes Forbes Councils Member. Claudio Saes is a partner and telecom practice leader at Bell Labs Consulting, a group of the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs. It has been more than a year since I last wrote about the global telecommunication landscape scenario. In that article, I provided my view of four possible strategic options telecom providers could explore to adapt to "ever-increasing data transmission rates": subsidies, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), infrastructure split and network facilitation. In this article, I want to review what's happened in recent years in the realms of these four strategic imperatives, the possible outcomes and considerations for telecom operators moving forward. In my original article, I advocated for the importance of subsidies, but there's a risk of confining telecom operators, original equipment manufacturers and their customers. At the time, the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program in the U.S. was seen as the solution to bringing the country fast, reliable connectivity. Fast forward to today, and the BEAD program has shown mixed results. While it aims to expand broadband access in underserved areas and help local businesses flourish with high-speed internet access, the rollout faces challenges, such as complex regulations. While all participating states and territories have approved their "internet for all" plans, some have pointed out that navigating state-level regulations and bureaucratic red tape could delay project implementation, echoing the initial concern about subsidies potentially creating dependency. For instance, certain smaller internet service providers rely on government grants, which raises the question of how sustainable these deployments might be once the funds dry up. Despite these challenges, the overall impact of subsidies has been constructive. With the new U.S. administration, I believe there may be an opening for the possibility of using low Earth orbit satellite technology and lowering regulation requirements for the skilled labor force. My second strategic imperative was related to M&As. In 2024, relevant moves took place in the U.S. market. Led by Verizon's $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications in the U.S., the Americas accounted for 62% of last year's global telecom M&A deal value. T-Mobile acquired fiber internet provider Metronet for $4.9 billion, which boosted its fixed broadband capabilities. This acquisition allowed T-Mobile to expand its home internet services and compete more effectively in the fixed broadband market. Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) made a surprising move by acquiring Ziply Fiber, a fiber internet provider based in Washington. This strategic investment gives Bell a foothold in the U.S. market and access to a new fiber network infrastructure. Last year also saw an increase in technology, media and telecommunications M&A activities compared to 2023. With $514 billion in deals, the landscape is evolving faster than ever, and we might see others following in 2025. Investors and companies targeting acquisitions should be prepared to scrutinize asset values and possible future investments. The infrastructure split trend has gained momentum, with several notable fiber companies’ deals in 2024. For instance, in a joint venture with BlackRock, AT&T spun off its fiber assets into a separate entity, GigaPower, and the companies said last year they wanted to expand that venture, according to Fierce Network. Additionally, AT&T expanded its fiber reach through partnerships with four open-access providers in late 2024, Fierce Network also said. The move will allow AT&T to expand its open fiber solution to its own subscribers in new areas and share the costs of deployment with third-party internet service providers. Telecom Italia completed a significant split by spinning off its fixed landline network. This move aimed to streamline operations and help the company compete more effectively. I'm finding this split model is becoming increasingly common as it provides clarity on the value of underlying network infrastructure and opens opportunities for coinvestment from technology partners or private equity. Telecom CEOs must have their eyes and hearts open for such a competitive strategy move, even if that means disrupting your own market first before others do it. Network facilitation has seen significant advancements, particularly in network slicing, data center interconnect and consumable bandwidth solutions. For example: 1. Network Slicing: T-Mobile was the first operator worldwide to shift to a standalone nationwide 5G network in August 2020, and the company started providing network slicing for some events in 2023. 2. Data Center Interconnect: EdgeConneX, a global hyperscale and hyperlocal data center provider, continued to expand last year to offer data center interconnect solutions ranging from mid to large data centers internationally. 3. Consumable Bandwidth Solutions: AT&T partnered with Equinix in 2022 to provide its customers with geo-redundant cloud on-ramps, according to an Equinix blog titled "5 Equinix Fabric Use Cases for Network Service Providers." This collaboration allows AT&T's clients to access cloud availability zones across Equinix's global footprint, the blog also said. I've found there’s a consensus that Network-as-a-Service won’t be widespread due to integration complexity and cost. However, I believe the telcos that have contracts with medium and large enterprises are the ones that benefit the most from these value-added services, especially in light of the AI investment surge. As we reflect on the developments across these four strategic imperatives, it's clear that the telecom industry continues to evolve rapidly. The interplay among subsidies, M&As, infrastructure strategies and network facilitation shapes a new landscape where traditional boundaries are blurring and new opportunities are emerging. Whether a telco embraces strategic partnerships for infrastructure expansion, leverages M&As for competitive positioning or capitalizes on NaaS for enterprise growth, it is imperative to reassess its organization and governance structure. In our experience, companies fail to meet time to market and get lost in pursuing new initiatives with existing organizations, so they're unable to reap the benefits of a new strategic direction. Looking ahead, the industry must navigate challenges such as regulatory uncertainties, technological disruptions and lower operating margins. However, those that can effectively leverage these strategic imperatives will be well-positioned to thrive in the ever-changing telecom ecosystem.

Title: Spot XRP ETF ‘Matter Of Time’: Expert Expects BlackRock To Join The Race

Nate Geraci—President of The ETF Store, host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute—renewed his confidence in a future spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Geraci’s comments arrived via X, where he stated, “Ripple lawsuit coming to end… Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved. XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Geraci, who had already forecast a spot ETF filing by BlackRock in mid-March, reiterated that it is increasingly plausible that major asset managers will seek to tap into top altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. On March 14, he wrote: “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both solana & xrp ETFs. Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” The expert emphasized that BlackRock is currently the leader (followed by Fidelity) by assets under management for both spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETF. “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw,” Geraci stated. Notably, yesterday’s filing by Fidelity for a spot Solana ETF filing appears to reinforce the notion that leading fund issuers are stepping into the altcoin ETF domain. Geraci’s renewed optimism comes on the heels of yesterday’s announcement from Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty, who provided what he characterized as his “last update on SEC v Ripple ever.” Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple. “Ripple has now agreed to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine (already in an interest-bearing escrow in cash), with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request. All subject to Commission vote, drafting of final documents and usual court processes,” Alderoty revealed. Nonetheless, pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has clarified via X that the case is not entirely concluded until the SEC’s formal vote and subsequent filings have been processed. Based on standard timelines, Rispoli suggests it could take up to 30 days for the Commission to vote and another 30 days for Judge Torres to sign off on lifting the injunction. In the best-case scenario, observers could see a fully resolved matter within roughly 60 days. The formal conclusion of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple would ostensibly remove a central barrier to major institutional products tied to XRP, thereby making Geraci’s spot XRP ETF prediction more plausible. At press time, XRP traded at $2.4495. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin Rally To $95K? Market Greed Suggests It’s Possible

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is on everyone’s crosshairs once more. The cryptocurrency shot up to $88,500 today, exciting traders who think the price will rise to $95,000 in the near term. But while optimism is high, so is caution. Some analysts are warning that a retreat back to $80,000 may occur before the next major rally starts. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that greed is building among crypto investors. References of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 or even as high as $159,000 have surged through social media platforms. While hope is generating all the excitement, Santiment reminds that such peaks in greed generally precede an imminent price adjustment. 🤑 As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Traders had also been holding back earlier in the year when Bitcoin fell to a low of $78,000. But that recent spike back to $88,500 does appear to have changed the general sentiment. Santiment suggests this might be an ideal time for traders to consider taking profits. Bitcoin miners appear to be confident about the future. According to data from CryptoQuant, miners have not been selling much of their Bitcoin recently. In fact, miner reserves now total 1.81 million BTC, which is worth around $159 billion. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, confirmed in a comment on X that no significant selling activity has been recorded among miners over the past 24 hours. This behavior could be a sign that miners are expecting higher prices and prefer to hold onto their earnings for now. Institutional investors are also playing a big role in the market’s momentum. On March 25, Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US recorded a total daily inflow of $27 million. BlackRock, one of the largest asset management firms, led the way with $42 million in inflows that day. Whereas some other funds such as Bitwise and WisdomTree experienced $10 million and $5 million outflows respectively, the robust demand for BlackRock helped in nudging the general trend into positive direction. BlackRock’s net assets in its Bitcoin spot ETF are currently at a little over $50 billion, demonstrating that institutional investors still have a passion for Bitcoin. Technical analysis is indicating Bitcoin might experience a temporary decline before the next peak. On its 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is having a difficult time surpassing a trendline of resistance, creating what experts refer to as a “double top” formation. The pattern suggests the potential for a price drop towards $85,000. Meanwhile, the most important support level is at $86,146, according to the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level. If Bitcoin manages to stay above this level, analysts indicate that the price may rebound and move towards $95,000.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Ripple SEC settlement – Partial fine stays, injunction to be lifted

What’s next for XRP as regulatory headwinds clear with pending SEC settlement? Ripple [XRP] reportedly settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This followed after the agency dropped its appeal against the firm without condition last week. According to Ripple’s Legal Chief Stuart Alderoty, the $125M fine for unregistered ‘institutional XRP sales’ was reduced to $50M as part of the agreement. Alderory stated, “The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine, with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request.” Here, the injunction referred to Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling that barred Ripple from future sales of XRP tokens, especially to institutions that could be deemed unregistered security offerings. The agreement was subject to a Commission vote. But policy watchers speculated it could be officially over within two months. According to pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli, “Then we wait on filing by SEC to lift injunction, which will be unopposed by Ripple. Judge Torres will sign off on it (less than 30 days from motion filing). At most, we are 60 days out from this being 100%, formally, legally, and spectacularly over.” Rispoli added that the case would be revisited only if no legislation was passed before 2028 and a crypto-hostile regime got into power. However, U.S. lawmakers were on track to pass legislation for stablecoins and crypto market structure by 2025. In fact, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expected them to be passed by August of this year. Besides, the new SEC’s ongoing regulatory rollbacks were part of its push for clarity in the sector. It recently held a roundtable discussion on the security status of crypto assets. In addition, the agency has planned more public events between now and June. These would clarify regulations on crypto trading, custody, tokenization, and DeFi. Reacting to the latest settlement update, Nate Geraci of ETF Store stated, “Ripple lawsuit coming to end…Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval is simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., to all be involved.” On the market side, the whale wallets with 10 million to 100 million XRP coins were on a steady accumulation spree from late February. XRP price was more sensitive to their movements (yellow) than the larger cohort with 100 million to 1 billion coins (they held 10 billion XRP, red). Source: Santiment XRP didn’t bulge on the price chart, perhaps because it had pumped 12% after last week’s dismissal update. With regulatory headwinds out of the way, the next price catalyst would be XRP ETF approval.

The FT reports that Fidelity’s launch is part of its expansion into the nascent market for tokenised versions of US Treasuries. Late last week it filed to launch a digital version of a US money market fund at the end of May, in direct competition with traditional asset manager rivals BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The move comes as crypto-friendly President Donald Trump pledged to promote the growth of “lawful and legitimate” dollar-backed stablecoins to support the US currency and called for supporting legislation to be ready to be signed into law by August. In no surprise to anyone, World Liberty Financial, the crypto project promoted by Trump and his sons, has also announced plans to launch its own stablecoin. The coin’s reserves will be backed by short-term US Treasuries and other cash equivalents.

Title: World’s Largest Asset Manager BlackRock Unveils First Bitcoin ETP In Europe

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and now a major player in the broader crypto landscape, is making headlines again with the upcoming launch of its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. Following the successful performance of its $48 billion US fund that tracks Bitcoin, the new iShares Bitcoin ETP is set to debut on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T, and on Euronext Amsterdam under the BTCN ticker on Tuesday. To attract investors from the outset, BlackRock is implementing a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, which will reduce the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. According to Bloomberg, this pricing strategy positions IB1T among the most competitively priced options in the market—significantly cheaper than Europe’s largest crypto ETP, CoinShares International Ltd’s physical Bitcoin product, which charges 0.25%. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product, commented on the launch, stating that it represents a potential “tipping point” in the industry. The iShares Bitcoin ETP marks BlackRock’s first venture into crypto-linked ETPs outside North America. While similar products have been available in Europe for years, the market—valued at $13.6 billion—remains significantly smaller compared to the US market. BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust made headlines upon its launch in January 2024 following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval, quickly accumulating billions in assets and setting records for ETF launches. The physical Bitcoin backing the IB1T will be custodied by Coinbase Global. The product is designed for both institutional and informed retail investors and will be issued by a special purpose vehicle based in Switzerland. In related developments, the asset manager is also expanding its digital asset offerings through collaboration with Securitize, a financial technology company for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which has recently surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, will launch a new share class on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, representing BlackRock’s first tokenized fund to be issued on a public blockchain. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL provides qualified investors with access to US dollar yields on-chain, featuring flexible custody options, daily dividend payouts, and near real-time peer-to-peer transfers. With BUIDL now available on seven blockchains—including Aptos (APT), Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL)—cross-chain interoperability is facilitated by Wormhole, allowing secure and seamless token transfers. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, highlighted the growing demand for tokenized real-world assets and the asset manager’s decision to expand to the Solana blockchain, stating: In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain. As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,000, up 8% on a weekly basis. Solana, on the other hand, has seen even greater gains with a price spike of nearly 20% in the same time frame, trading at $145.

Title: Time for businesses to return to their essential purpose

U.S. Federal Housing director Bill Pulte exposes more empty office buildings and wasteful spending in Washington on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Corporate America is poised to unlock its potential as never before. For years, progressive activists have successfully pushed boards of directors and CEOs at top companies to support and promote radical causes that would never stand a chance at the ballot box. The end-result has been to compromise many corporate leaders’ commitment to fulfilling their fiduciary duties and diminished the American economy’s capacity to deliver prosperity for the American people. A correction is long overdue. And it’s finally underway. When businesses try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. (Getty Images) Consider the recent news from BlackRock, where CEO Larry Fink has signaled his company’s rejection of legally risky and divisive "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" commitments, and abandoned his position as a leader in the so-called "Environmental, Social, and Governance" revolution. DEATH OF DEI IS A MASSIVE REMINDER THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO RUN A BUSINESSBlackRock’s course correction is confirmation of a massive sea change throughout Corporate America. Other financial giants like State Street and JPMorgan Chase have also ditched DEI, along with household brands like Walmart, Target, McDonald’s and Ford. The list is expansive and should be encouraging to every American CEO, shareholder, consumer and employee. After more than half a decade of allowing their businesses to be weaponized by activists, leaders like Fink are now refocusing on the main goals of businesses. Those goals are at the center of the Good for Business Coalition and our Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation. This coalition’s vision rests on four pillars: creating economic value, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders, avoiding entanglement in political controversies, and advancing the general welfare through business success rather than political advocacy. LAWFARE AND THE DEATH OF DEI AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION This approach recognizes an essential truth: that businesses serve society best when they focus on what they do best: creating wealth by delivering consumers with goods and services that people need and want. Profit is what drives a pharmaceutical company to develop life-saving medicines. It also drives a technology company to create tools that enhance human capability to do great things that our grandparents could never have imagined. This doesn't mean corporations should be indifferent to broader social questions or have a license to provide unethically. It simply means that their specific contribution to society’s well-being is through doing what business does best. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Through pursuing profit and generating economic value, businesses serve customers, develop innovative products, create jobs and generate returns that help build millions of Americans' retirement savings. If businesses choose, they can also contribute through traditional corporate citizenship such as supporting local communities or engaging in philanthropy. Businesses aren't designed to be political actors – they lack both the democratic legitimacy and the institutional competence for that role. When they try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. The path forward is clear: American businesses need to recommit to their fundamental purpose. That means living up to high ethical standards and good business practice, pursuing operational excellence, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders and avoiding unnecessary political entanglements. It means measuring success by the value created for customers and the returns generated for investors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When businesses focus on doing what they do best, they create the innovation, prosperity and opportunity that truly advance human flourishing. The business of business is business – not because social issues don't matter, but because this is how business best serves society. And business leaders who reprioritize along these lines deserve our support. It's time for American corporations to remember this fundamental truth and return to their essential purpose.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) is listed on German, French, and Dutch stock exchanges, according to a prospectus on the iShares website. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” the prospectus reads. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock to learn more. Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, would custody the digital assets for the investment vehicle, according to the prospectus. BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 was considered a pivotal moment in their eventual approval in January 2024, given its status as the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. It's iShares Bitcoin Trust has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, the most among the 11 bitcoin funds currently trading, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Spot Bitcoin funds now control nearly $100 billion in assets. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum fund has received more than $4 billion in assets since it debuted in July 2024. Crypto ETFs have given investors exposure to the asset in a more familiar financial product. Separately, in an announcement Tuesday, tokenization platform Securitize said that it had launched BlackRock’s $1.7 billion tokenized treasury fund BUIDL on the Solana blockchain. “Following the one-year anniversary of BUIDL’s launch, BlackRock and Securitize are expanding access with a new share class on the Solana network,” Securitize said in a post on X. “This milestone marks an important step in the continued institutional adoption of tokenized real-world assets,” it added.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, launched its first European Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) on Tuesday. According to a Bloomberg report, the iShares Bitcoin ETP (iB1T) began trading on Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, and Germany’s Xetra exchange, offering institutional and retail investors regulated exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance. The product is physically backed by Bitcoin and secured through Coinbase Custody International Ltd., according to the report. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product, characterized the launch as a significant industry milestone. “It reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” The European expansion follows the success of BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust, which has accumulated over $50 billion in assets since its debut last year. By entering European markets, the firm signals its continued commitment to integrating cryptocurrency investments into mainstream financial strategies. Earlier this month, BlackRock reportedly incorporated its iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) into some of its model portfolios. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, reportedly wrote in an investment commentary at the time that the firm believes Bitcoin has “long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum is raising at least US$750 million ($1.2 billion) at a US$6 billion pre-money valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter. BlackRock is leading the fundraising effort, which has not yet been completed, one of the people said. Unlike some quantum computing startups using exotic materials, PsiQuantum is aiming to modify traditional manufacturing techniques from the semiconductor industry. The company uses existing photonics technology - the same kind of chipmaking used to make the fibre-optic connections for internet communications - at a factory run by GlobalFoundries in New York, saying it plans to make millions of quantum chips. Scaling up those plans to make a high volume of quantum computing processors is a costly, complex endeavour and requires fundraising, one of the people said. Startups and major tech firms alike are chasing quantum computing, which can solve complex problems that would take conventional computers thousands or millions of years, such as predicting how atoms and molecules will interact. Scientists hope to use quantum machines to develop new materials for batteries and new drugs. In recent months, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Amazon have all unveiled new quantum computing chips. Last week, Nvidia, the world's biggest chip firm, said that it will establish a quantum computing research centre in Boston. PsiQuantum is working with the governments in Australia and the United States to build two quantum computers in the coming years - one in Brisbane, Australia, and the other in Chicago. Australia is investing almost a billion dollars in the startup, although there are few details on what the investment entails, and attempts to gain an explanation have so far been thwarted. Quantum computers have been around for decades but have produced too many errors to be more useful than conventional computers. In recent years, companies have made advances in making better quantum chips and correcting those errors, with PsiQuantum saying it believes it will have a useful machine by 2029 or sooner and Google saying earlier this year that it will have useful quantum applications within five years.

Title: XRPL Hits 2.8 Billion Flawless Transactions—Big Players Are Paying Attention

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Blockchain technology is receiving a boost with the XRP Ledger, based on recent findings from industry observers. The system has handled over 2.8 billion transactions without any security failure, which has caught the eye of financial institutions globally. According to Jasmine Cooper, RippleX Head of Product, the effectiveness of XRPL is one of the major reasons institutional investors are drawn to it. Institutional asset issuers and investors are using XRPL more because of its speed and reliability. For example, OpenEden has recently hit milestones in tokenizing US Treasury bills on the platform. Institutional investors are purchasing these tokenized assets that desire access to on-chain financial instruments. BlackRock, the global asset management titan, is also making a push into asset tokenization, lining up with XRPL’s platform. Regulated exchanges like Archax are even listing tokenized assets created on the ledger, and it’s becoming more acceptable to mainstream financial institutions. XRP Ledger Adoption is Surging! Institutions, DeFi, Stablecoins, Tokenization Jasmine Cooper, Head of Product at RippleX, joined me to discuss the latest and the greatest with the XRP Ledger. 02:34 Jasmine’s background 04:43 Real Estate on Blockchain 06:18 RippleX overview… pic.twitter.com/HkC2ubbflA — Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) March 23, 2025 XRPL is revolutionizing the way people buy and sell real estate by enabling tokenization. Firms such as Propy utilize it to facilitate automatic property sales, minimizing paperwork and accelerating transactions. This facilitates real estate trading and makes it more accessible. This change might have a huge effect on an industry that is normally sluggish and convoluted. Through blockchain, XRPL assists in making transactions easy yet secure and reliable. DeFi on XRPL is gaining traction, owing to fresh technology such as the Automated Market Maker (AMM). The functionality allows traders to exchange assets and provide liquidity directly on the blockchain, eliminating the role of centralized exchanges. RippleX is also looking to simplify XRPL for developers. The firm is introducing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that enables developers to create Ethereum-based smart contracts with the advantage of XRPL’s low-cost, high-speed transactions. This element is likely to have more DeFi projects hitting the ledger and improve its connectivity with other blockchain networks. Ripple recently rolled out RLUSD, a new US dollar-backed stablecoin, on a small number of small crypto exchanges. The stablecoin will be applied in cross-border payments and liquidity. RippleX is said to be seeking regulatory approval to ensure that RLUSD meets the regulations, which could make it more appealing to institutional users. The stablecoin is positioned as an adjunct to XRP, already employed as an international bridge currency. If the RLUSD gains traction, adoption of the XRPL network is likely to further increase.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: A $41B Investment Firm Wants to Stick With Just Bitcoin ETFs as Safer Bet

Earlier this year, Calamos made its crypto debut with the launch of not one but three funds designed to protect investors from the volatility in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. But the global investment management firm, which handles $41.3 billion in assets, is far from launching any other products beyond bitcoin, — even Ethereum (ETH), said its head of ETFs Matt Kaufman in an interview with CoinDesk. Since their inception, Calamos’ protected BTC funds have attracted over $100 million from investors, which primarily include financial advisors. For most firms looking to make an entrance into the crypto market, launching a bitcoin product is just the first step in a long journey that quickly extends to ethereum-based products. BlackRock, for example, applied to launch its spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in June 2023 and five months later, did the same for Ethereum (ETH). “Ethereum doesn’t really meet our criteria for being able to effectively hedge that exposure,” he said. “It’s not a liquid asset, there’s no options on Ethereum ETPs so if those check boxes start to get built, we’ll explore it but right now it’s not on our radar.” The Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOJ), Calamos Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXJ) and Calamos Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTJ) offer investors 80-100% downside protection with an upside cap rate of 10-55%. This is achieved by using a combination of Treasuries and options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index. While Cboe Exchange has filed to list options tied to Ether ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January delayed its deadline to approve or deny the product. The Commission will have to stick to the final deadline in May, however. Another asset class that Calamos won’t likely ever touch is meme coins, Kaufman said. “We’re a risk manager, so we build things we know will work,” he said. “From that perspective, I don’t have any opinion on meme coins but it’s not something I would ever do.” Kaufman believes that the recent surge in applications for meme coin ETFs highlights the fact that investors have to do their due diligence. “We live in America, you have to know what you own. Freedom gives you choice and with choice comes responsibility,” he said.

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—A federal court ruling regarding ESG investing with BlackRock could put public pension funds on the defense, a consumer group is warning. Consumers’ Research sent letters to the largest public pensions boards in each state Tuesday warning BlackRock’s focus on ESG–an acronym for environmental, social, and governance–could lead to serious liabilities and a breach of fiduciary duty and put trillions of dollars in American pension money at risk. In a first-of-its kind federal court decision on ESG, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, of the Northern District of Texas, held in January in the case of Spence v. American Airlines that the airline’s pension was in breach of its fiduciary duty for allowing BlackRock to weigh ESG consideration in employees’ retirement plans. BlackRock was not a party in the lawsuit. “In Spence, offering BlackRock funds in the company’s 401(k) plans violated the company’s duty to focus only on financial returns because publicly available evidence put the plan fiduciaries on notice that BlackRock uses its funds to pursue goals other than financial returns—like the ESG goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” says the letter shared with The Daily Signal. BlackRock, based in New York, had an asset portfolio totaling $11.6 trillion in 2024. It has come under fire in recent years not only for ESG investing but also for ties to China, as well as having former executives in highly placed administration positions under President Joe Biden. The company also leveraged its resources to push changes to the board of ExxonMobil. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported BlackRock broke with climate groups and eliminated diversity targets in a story headlined, “BlackRock’s ‘Woke’ Era is Over.” However, Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, contends BlackRock is still promoting net-zero carbon and is trying to rebrand. “This ruling shows there could be lawsuits against the state pension fund or lawsuits against pension trustees,” Hild told The Daily Signal. “ESG investing is a danger to pension holders, a danger to taxpayers, and a danger to pension trustees that could be held personally liable.” He said he’s hopeful this will change the investment strategy of the firm going forward. “This is not a vendetta against BlackRock, but I am opposed to pushing a political agenda with people’s retirement,” Hild added. American Airlines investments reportedly did not have ESG objectives and did not underperform. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” a BlackRock spokesperson told The Daily Signal. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” The court ruling stemmed from a class action lawsuit by American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence with more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. O’Connor, an appointee of George W. Bush, said in the opinion, “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the plan.” American Airlines did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this story. The Consumers’ Research letter Tuesday asserts state pension boards should review their investment with BlackRock to ensure similar problems—such as politicized investments—aren’t happening. “In conclusion, any state pension board using BlackRock to manage its pension plans is now on notice that a federal court has found that BlackRock acted with an ‘investment strategy … focused on ESG investing’ and ‘a pursuit of non-pecuniary interests,’ and fiduciaries of a fund that invested with BlackRock breached their duty of loyalty,” the letter continues. In January, Consumers’ Research sent a letter to all Fortune 500 companies warning of potential fiduciary duty violations and investment with BlackRock.

Title: Solana Rises As BlackRock Brings Its $1,700,000,000 Tokenized Treasury Fund to Ethereum Rival’s Chain

Solana (SOL) is green on the day on reports that BlackRock is moving its blockchain-based money market fund onto the Ethereum (ETH) competitor’s network. Fortune reports that the world’s largest asset manager is adding its $1.7 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana blockchain. Solana is trading for $145 at time of writing, up nearly 19% in the last week. Launched a year ago, BUIDL uses traditional money market funds, which investors use to store cash in the near term and earn yield on it, combined with blockchain payment properties. Solana is now the seventh blockchain compatible with the tokenized money market fund BUIDL, after its initial launch on Ethereum. BlackRock’s technology partner, Securitize, says the fund is expected to exceed $2 billion in cash and Treasury bills by early April. Says Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, “We’re making [money market funds] unboring. We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” One benefit BUIDL offers over traditional money market funds is 24/7 trading. Says Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, “Our vision for why on-chain finance adds more value is because you can do more things with those assets on chain than you could if [they’re] sitting in your brokerage account.” BUIDL is part of BlackRock’s long-term digital asset strategy, which includes its spot-Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the future of finance includes the “tokenization of every financial asset.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Should We Compare Bitcoin to Gold? Lessons From the Last Financial Crisis

Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:53:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Rahul Kapoor and Lehigh University’s Natalya Vinokurova explain the risks associated with a common argument for investing in Bitcoin: comparing it to gold. Rahul Kapoor Rahul Kapoor, Natalya Vinokurova The following article was written by Wharton management professor Rahul Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova, associate professor of management at the College of Business at Lehigh University. Bitcoin is now priced at almost a hundred thousand dollars with a total market of almost two trillion dollars. A common argument promoting investment in Bitcoin compares it to gold — a time-tested store of value and a safe haven for generating significant investment returns. How credible is that analogy, and more importantly, what is the risk that comes with it? We are in a good position to address this issue. One of us has studied the development and adoption of technological innovations for more than two decades; the other has researched the connection between innovation, analogies, and financial crises. Let’s think about where the great financial crisis of 2008 came from. Investors accepted the analogy of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to bonds. MBS are a class of investments that entitle the investor to a fraction of cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages in the securities’ collateral. While MBS carried risks that were quite different from bonds (such as the systemic risk of a house price correction across the economy), they were rated by the same credit rating agencies as bonds. Consequently, even conservative investors such as pension funds were willing to invest in these new supposedly safe securities. However, the analogy masked several aspects of the financial system: leverage in the system, lack of transparency about which investors owned what, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and inadequate risk management tools. Combined, these factors turned MBS into the opposite of safe assets both for the investors holding them and the society at large. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. However, they almost always carry the risk of masking features that could be fundamentally important in the role that the innovation plays with respect to its intended use, resulting in unintended negative consequences, such as the financial crisis of 2008. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has been increasingly referred to as digital gold, emphasizing its modern digital nature as a store of value, with limited supply that is decentralized (not controlled by central banks) and operating on blockchain technology architecture. Accordingly, it has been pitched as a vehicle for investors enthusiastic about technology and seeking long-term financial gains that provide a hedge against inflation and are immune to economic cycles. Buyers and institutions are increasingly explaining their decision to invest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in terms of it being the new digital gold. For example, the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a Bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been “wrong” about Bitcoin and now believes Bitcoin is “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial instrument. State Street forecasts that cryptocurrency ETFs will surpass precious metal ETFs in North American assets by the end of 2025, becoming the third-largest asset class in the $15 trillion ETF industry. While the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, emphasized in marketing campaigns and expert commentaries, are appealing and reasonably uncontroversial, they mask some important differences concerning the structure of value and the nature of ownership. Unlike Bitcoin, gold has physical properties as a precious metal that are attractive for many applications, including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. In fact, it is estimated that more than half of the global gold reserve is used in such applications, with the rest held by central banks or private investors. Moreover, the quality of gold (with respect to the metal purity) can be ascertained through simple scientific tests. Accordingly, the structure of value for gold is much more tangible and transparent than that of Bitcoin. While gold has a history of holding its value in times of societal cataclysms such as wars, it is not clear that Bitcoin could survive a major power grid failure. The lack of transparency in the value structure of Bitcoin has led to speculative trading, involving individuals who don’t have the expertise necessary to understand the basis of value or critically evaluate the prospects of long-term returns. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and mortgage-backed securities suggest that history may be repeating itself. While the blockchain ledger provides a public database of Bitcoin ownership and transactions, there is little information about who owns what. This dearth of public and common knowledge about who owns Bitcoin is eerily reminiscent of the aftermath of the MBS crisis in which major financial institutions discovered — to their surprise — that they held the risk that they believed they had passed on to other players. Today, pension funds from Wisconsin, Michigan, the UK, and Australia have begun investing in Bitcoin, primarily through regulated U.S. ETFs. This move is driven by Bitcoin’s substantial value increase and a pro-crypto U.S. administration. This is a pattern that is quite similar to pension funds investing in MBS without fully understanding the risks. It has been estimated that a large majority of Bitcoins are owned by individual investors who own a small fraction of a single Bitcoin. This fragmentation and lack of transparency of ownership of a speculative asset presents systemic risk. The opaque structure of value, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and the willingness of major financial institutions to sell these arcane products to less sophisticated investors suggest that Bitcoin has more similarities with MBS than it has with gold. A critical ingredient of the 2008 mortgage crisis was the willingness of leaders of major financial institutions to go along with leveraged trading in securities that they did not understand due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next big thing. These are exactly the patterns we are seeing in Bitcoin trading today. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and MBS suggest that history may be repeating itself. In fact, the negative consequences of the analogy of Bitcoin to gold might be even more severe than the analogy of MBS to bonds. While most MBS at the end of the day were backed by real assets — mortgages on real houses — Bitcoin is not backed by any real assets. If you are not in the business of speculation, steering clear of investing in Bitcoin — or for that matter any cryptocurrency — may be the best way to avoid the fallout from another misguided analogy.

Title: BlackRock taps Solana for BUIDL tokenized fund as Bitcoin ETP debuts in Europe

BlackRock introduces Bitcoin ETP in Europe and integrates BUIDL to Solana in strategic blockchain embrace. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest investment firm in the world with over $11 trillion in assets under management, made two significant moves on March 25 to increase its presence in the crypto industry. The firm has extended its tokenized money market fund to the Solana blockchain and introduced its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in the European market. BlackRock has launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP across major European markets. According to the product’s website, the ETP will begin trading on March 25 on Germany’s Xetra exchange, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The product trades under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Paris and BTCN in Amsterdam. To encourage adoption, the ETP is debuting with a reduced fee of 0.15%, which will remain in effect until 2026. After that, the fees will increase to 0.25%, aligning with similar regional offerings. This launch follows the strong performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the US, which currently manages over $50 billion in assets. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based fund now holds approximately 2.9% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply. In a separate development, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is now live on Solana. This marks the seventh blockchain to support the fund, following earlier rollouts on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aptos, Polygon, and Optimism. Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for BUIDL, explained that it expanded the product to Solana because of the blockchain network’s fast transaction speeds and low network fees. Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said: “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” BUIDL tokenizes traditional money market funds, offering the benefits of blockchain-based settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts with conventional funds that operate within limited market hours. Currently, BUIDL manages over $1.7 billion in assets, primarily in cash and short-term US Treasury bills. Ethereum hosts the bulk of these holdings—over $1.5 billion—while the remaining assets are distributed across other supported blockchains. Aptos and Avalanche each hold around $53 million, followed by Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which have $33 million, $32 million, and $27 million, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Stay ahead in the crypto game: Follow us on X for daily updates and analysis. Tether's investment in Be Water reflects its broadening influence beyond stablecoins. 21Shares capitalizes on growing institutional interest to inroduce transparent crypto ETPs in Europe. According to the BaFin, the sUSDe offer "profit promises," potentially classifying it as a security. This marks the third time this year that the European Central Bank urged for the digital euro launch. Bitcoin's price rises catch short sellers off guard despite a bearish funding rate outlook. GameStop will replicated the Bitcoin accumulation method popularized by Strategy. Bernstein believes Strategy could massively expand its Bitcoin holdings by 2033, dependent on economic conditions and price trajectory. Rumble aims to revamp digital asset adoption among global creators with a new wallet, following a $775 million Tether investment.

A new €16 million dedicated women’s health centre is to open in Dublin in the autumn. The clinic will be run by Blackrock Health, which is the umbrella company formed by businessman Larry Goodman after he took full control of three of the best-known private hospitals in the State – Blackrock Clinic, Hermitage Clinic and Galway Clinic. The new facility, which will be called Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, will create 50 new jobs. The group said the centre will be the “most comprehensive” private, consultant-led women’s health centre of its kind in Ireland. Planning permission was granted for the facility in recent weeks. The clinic, which will be located at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2, will offer 340 outpatient appointments per day, and will provide access to a range of consultant-led and allied health services in an environment designed exclusively around the needs of women. The centre will offer consultant-led clinics in gynaecology, urology, breast health, endocrinology, gastroenterology, pain medicine, cardiology, dermatology, plastics and aesthetics, psychology and psychotherapy, health screening, and rheumatology. These services will be complemented by a full suite of allied health offerings, including physiotherapy, urodynamics, phlebotomy, and advanced radiology diagnostics including Dexa scanning, mammography, and ultrasound. Blackrock Health chief executive Dr Caroline Whelan said: “We understand the health concerns of the nation, how they have evolved and why now is the time to deliver care that is tailored to women. “That is why we are so proud to invest €16 million to open the Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, offering holistic care that treats the healthcare issues that are specific to women, specifically for women.” The investment by Blackrock Health is in addition to the €500 million investment announced in September. Blackrock Health employs more than 3000 staff and counts 600 consultants in 50 medical specialities on its books. Together, its hospitals have a total of 418 inpatient beds including 28 ICU beds and 22 operating theatres. Together, the group cared for more than 360,000 patients last year. Blackrock Health is part of Parma Health, a division of Mr Goodman’s Parma Group.

For years, crypto’s positioned itself as the next great technological revolution. But as we witness the explosive rise of AI, it's time for crypto to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence, and crypto will play a supporting role rather than be the star. This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included. With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer. Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications. This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI. This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world. What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility. While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry. This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products. Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again: distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure. We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode. For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents. What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products. Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value. Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation. For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective (Vast.ai, a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years). Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain. In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy. The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail. Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate. For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI. The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact. The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself. If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.
