A schools cup final that packed a season’s amount of incident and drama into the final hour of action culminated in Rice College being crowned the national senior champions for the first time in their history in Athlone. Backboned by the majority of the team that lost last year’s Junior (Tom Ticher) Cup final a year ago at the same venue, it looked for the opening 45 minutes as if Blackrock College’s superior physicality and power might give them the edge, even though that period passed by without either goalkeeper being seriously tested. The Westport side posed much more of a threat after the interval when they tried to work the ball into attacking areas much more methodically rather than looking to simply hit lone striker Jack O’Malley from 20 yards away or more, but Blackrock also found it easier to break through, with Jack Kelly testing Michael McDonnell from close range in the first minute. Harry Weir and Geordy Lavin down the left-hand side showed outstanding craft and ingenuity to open up the Rice defence on a couple of occasions, but the breakthrough never came, and instead it was Rían Durkan who broke the deadlock, coolly rolling the ball to the net after Jack O’Malley’s composure wrong-footed the Blackrock defence. That only served as the cue for Blackrock to step up the pressure, and when Cormac Sheahan headed the equaliser from Conor O’Neill’s corner, the South Dublin side and 2003 national champions had all the momentum. Nothing came of it however, meaning that the contest moved to overtime, when Durkan again gave Rice the lead when he slipped a low shot inside the near post with four minutes of overtime remaining. Those four minutes were as frantic as you’d imagine, with Rice College missing a chance to score while Ronan Ffrench was caught upfield, and that looked fatal when Lavin curled a free around the wall and into the bottom corner with the last kick. Penalties began, the drama continued. Evan Durkan set the tone by opening with a Panenka chip, McDonnell’s save on Lavin looked to give Rice College the upper hand, only for two saves from Ffrench to leave Peter Walsh with a kick to win it. A thunderous strike off the bottom of the crossbar, bouncing a yard out from the goal line, showed the wafer-thin margin between victory and defeat, all the more when captain Alex Halpin hit the top corner with the first sudden death kick and Jack Luff’s pulled effort wide of the post confirmed the Mayo school’s win. RICE COLLEGE: M McDonnell; E Moran (T McGeough FT), M Staunton, C McGing, S Casey; Jamie O’Malley (D Reynolds 56), K Conway (C Cannon 71, S Popov 104); A Halpin, E Durkan, R Durkan; Jack O’Malley. BLACKROCK COLLEGE: R Ffrench; D Noonan (R Dowling 84), J Luff, C Sheahan, H Weir; S Mooney, C O’Neill; C Hearty (J Gleeson Halpin 65), P Walsh, G Lavin; J Kelly (A Quinn 56). Referee: Jay Merriman.

Title: Blackrock Clinic Health Group given go-ahead for women’s health centre
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/12/blackrock-clinic-health-group-given-go-ahead-for-womens-health-centre/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T15:04:33Z
Full Content:
Plans by the Blackrock Clinic Health Group to establish a women’s health centre in Dublin city have been approved. Dublin City Council granted permission to the Larry Goodman Trust-owned Blackrock UC, saying the proposed facility at 2-5 Warrington Place “would not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area”. A six-page planner’s report found “the medical use proposed does not raise any concerns in terms of potential impact within the wider surrounding area”. Blackrock UC has said 50 jobs will be created by the women’s health centre which is expected to cater for an estimated 340 attendees per day. The planning application seeks a change of use of an office development to a centre it says “will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland”. A planning report lodged with the application said the facility aligns with priorities outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-25, which includes improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care, and preventive health services such as mammograms and Dexa scans. The report by McGill Planning stated “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms, and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the Action Plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health, and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, Ms Shauna Hewitt said the repurposing of the existing office building would minimise environmental impact and align with sustainable practices, “an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. She added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centred design, this transformation into a Women’s Health Centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. “The proposed Women’s Health Centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability, and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location.” The report also stated that the proposed centre would be strategically located to integrate into Dublin’s existing network of women’s healthcare facilities.

Title: Trillion-Dollar Fusion: AI And Crypto Rewiring Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/03/12/trillion-dollar-fusion-ai-and-crypto-rewiring-finance/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:11:03Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan , Contributor. human hand taking bitcoin from robotic hand Your money never sleeps. Before the world wakes, artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems are already scanning markets, seizing opportunities, and securing profits. This isn’t the future—it’s happening now. AI and blockchain—the twin engines of autonomous finance—aren’t just digitizing money; they’re rewiring finance itself. Blockchain is the trust engine, enforcing transparency and enabling atomic settlement—no middlemen required. AI is the intelligence engine, continuously learning, predicting, and executing trades in real time through autonomous agents. These agents optimize capital flows with unmatched speed, but their rapid evolution introduces structural risks—algorithmic instability, security vulnerabilities, regulatory blind spots, and the potential for cascading failures if safeguards aren’t in place. Retail investors now tap into hedge-fund-grade strategies—but they’re also vulnerable to flash crashes that can erase savings in an instant. The result? A financial system that never stops learning, adapting, and executing—reacting to market shifts at speeds no human can match. Finance's power dynamics are shifting as Wall Street titans and nimble disruptors leverage these technologies to gain an edge. Institutional investors deploy algorithms that execute optimum trades, while tech-first banks dramatically cut operational costs. Traditional wealth managers accustomed to relationship-driven finance must now adapt to a world where algorithms make split-second decisions. Trillion-Dollar Upheaval The financial services market is staggering: $100 trillion in asset management, $240 trillion in global payments, $200 trillion in banking, and trillions trading in repo markets daily. AI is surging toward $1.8 trillion, crypto is cementing its $2 trillion foothold, and tokenization is set to unlock $16 trillion in liquid assets by 2030. At this scale, efficiency gains—such as instant settlements and the removal of intermediaries—don’t just cut costs. They create new profit centers for incumbents and unlock high-value opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, reshaping the financial landscape. For centuries, financial power was concentrated in the hands of a few—banks with rigid hours, brokers with steep fees, and investment firms with high barriers to entry. That dominance is fading. AI and blockchain aren’t just making finance faster; they’re making it accessible. Hedge fund-grade strategies, real-time insights, and automated portfolio management are no longer reserved for institutions. From fraud detection to high-speed execution, intelligent systems eliminate inefficiencies and redefine financial participation. The gates are no longer locked—anyone with an internet connection can enter. Industry Giants Are Paying Attention Traditional finance (TradFI) sees the shift—AI and blockchain are no longer experimental; they’re becoming the backbone of financial infrastructure. But adoption isn't instant. Financial institutions, entrenched in compliance and legacy systems, must tread carefully—yet they aren't sitting idle. They recognize the potential and are actively integrating AI's paradigm-shifting capabilities in advanced analytics and dramatic operational efficiency gains while methodically exploring blockchain for settlement and tokenization. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's tech titans—Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia—are unleashing powerful AI innovations, building the infrastructure they believe will underpin entire industries, finance included. With total investments approaching the trillion-dollar mark, these tech giants are betting big on AI's transformative potential across the entire economy. BlackRock, managing a jaw-dropping $10 trillion, sent shockwaves through Wall Street by launching its first tokenized fund on Ethereum. Suddenly, blockchain wasn't just for crypto diehards—it was institutional finance's next big move. Fidelity and Schwab are building institutional crypto custody and trading services. Meanwhile, crypto's early disruptors like Coinbase and Kraken have evolved into AI-powered financial powerhouses, integrating real-time fraud detection and high-speed execution that outpaces legacy markets. The Living Market: Finance's New Nervous System & Digital Workforce Together, AI and blockchain create an ecosystem where automation isn't just about speed but about trust, security, and predictive intelligence. A new financial nervous system is emerging—one that doesn't just automate but actively thinks, learns, and adapts. This evolving network integrates security, adaptability, and intelligence seamlessly. Blockchain serves as the backbone, while AI functions as the cognitive layer—transforming static rules into dynamic learning. This isn't just a faster version of today's financial systems; it's an entirely new species. Traditional finance relies on centralized controls and human intervention. This new ecosystem makes autonomous decisions, self-corrects vulnerabilities, and optimizes in real-time. The implications extend beyond efficiency—we're entering an era where capital moves with real-time intelligence, reacting instantly to opportunities and risks. This shift isn't about 24/7 markets—it's about superhuman markets. AI-driven trading reads millions of signals at once, hedges risks in milliseconds, and fine-tunes strategies faster than any human trader could dream of. Fintech world map The AI-Blockchain Nexus: Reshaping Financial Infrastructure The convergence of AI and blockchain isn’t just an incremental upgrade—it’s a fundamental shift in finance. At their intersection, these technologies unlock capabilities neither could achieve alone, reshaping trading, payments, security, and infrastructure. Trading & Investment PlatformsCoinbase and Kraken use machine learning to detect fraud in microseconds while analyzing complex market patterns beyond human capability. Fidelity is expanding institutional-grade custodial and trading services, while Charles Schwab’s blockchain-backed ETFs offer mainstream investors a gateway to digital assets. SoSoValue, an AI-powered trading platform, launched SSI on Base Chain, enabling users to hold algorithmically rebalanced crypto baskets, like on-chain ETFs. With 30M registered users and 1M DAUs in 2024, it hit $200M TVL within weeks of staking launch. Its top index tokens, MAG7.ssi and USSI (hedged MAG7.ssi for funding rate earning), rank among Uniswap Base’s top 5 liquidity pools. Payment & Settlement Systems AI-driven fraud detection and transaction optimization are transforming payments. PayPal’s AI systems have cut fraud rates by 30% while processing over $1.5 trillion annually—all without customers noticing. Stripe enhances payment routing with machine learning, reducing costs for merchants. Visa is piloting AI-powered cross-border settlements, while Ripple’s AI-enhanced payment systems analyze transactions in real-time, improving security and slashing settlement times. Security & Risk ManagementAave and Compound use AI-driven predictive models to dynamically adjust lending rates and mitigate liquidity risks. OKX integrates multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, reinforcing cryptographic security. Layer-2 networks like Polygon and Optimism are experimenting with AI-enhanced smart contract audits, minimizing vulnerabilities in decentralized applications. WhiteBIT is a thoroughly audited crypto exchange, with security certification (CCSS Level 3) and PCI DSS certification. Security measures include multi-user approval protocols, cold storage for 96% of funds, and advanced encryption for private keys. CER.live includes it among its top five exchanges for security. Through institutional partnerships and its Barcelona sponsorship, WhiteBIT continues advancing mainstream crypto adoption. Infrastructure & DevelopmentJPMorgan is deploying AI-driven analytics to optimize blockchain-based settlements, while Goldman Sachs is exploring AI applications in tokenized asset management. ConsenSys and Polygon are developing AI-enhanced smart contract infrastructure to improve governance efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Meanwhile, Circle is embedding AI into compliance systems, simplifying regulatory processes for digital assets. ForU AI pioneers Real-World AI (RWAI), enabling users to create AI-DIDs and train autonomous AI Agents for on-chain economies. These agents, guided by goals, KPIs, and tokenized incentives, drive real economic activity while ensuring transparency and accountability. By merging AI with blockchain’s decentralized coordination, ForU AI is redefining automation—empowering communities to govern, build, and optimize shared financial and social ecosystems. The shift from human-managed finance to AI-powered financial ecosystems is no longer theoretical—it's already in motion. The future of finance isn’t just about speed—it’s about autonomy, adaptability, and continuous evolution. The AI-Blockchain Dilemma: Hype Meets Hard Reality AI and blockchain are rewriting finance, but they come with real risks. Regulators struggle to keep up with borderless AI-driven markets, where oversight gaps can allow hidden risks to pile up. Algorithmic volatility is another wild card—just look at the 2010 Flash Crash when high-frequency trading erased nearly $1 trillion in minutes. Regulators worldwide, from the SEC to the European Commission, are actively assessing how to oversee AI-driven markets, but no global framework yet exists. And while blockchain promises decentralization, AI’s massive computing demands could shift power to those with the biggest infrastructure, reinforcing financial gatekeeping instead of breaking it. The biggest unknown? Financial stability. Traditional markets have circuit breakers and central banks to stop crises from spiraling out of control—but in AI-powered, blockchain-driven finance, who steps in when things go wrong? These challenges aren’t theoretical—they’re already shaping global regulatory debates. The future of AI-driven finance depends on how we balance innovation and control. Your Place in the Financial Revolution Finance is at an inflection point, undergoing an infrastructure overhaul with profound, far-reaching effects. For centuries, financial expertise has been locked behind exclusive credentials and privileged access. AI and blockchain are dismantling these walls, making advanced financial tools available to everyone. Make no mistake: this isn't some distant future to contemplate—it's a financial tsunami already reshaping the shore. Finance is diverging: the old system, built for a slower, human-driven market, and the new frontier—optimized for instant, AI-powered decision-making. As you read this, billions are flowing through AI-driven systems—relentless, autonomous, and unstoppable. The tide is shifting. Ride the wave, or get left behind.

Title: Former Anheuser-Busch’s exec trashes Bud Light’s Dylan Mulvaney partnership: Not ‘authentic at all’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/12/business/former-bud-light-executive-blames-dylan-mulvaney-dei-for-companys-downfall/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:07:47Z
Full Content:
A former Anheuser-Busch executive criticized the company’s decision to partner with Dylan Mulvaney, saying it wasn’t “authentic at all.” “The problem with the Bud Light-Dylan Mulvaney partnership was they just were not an authentic partnership at all,” Anson Frericks told Fox News Digital. “They were catering to a lot of those special interests.” Frericks began his career at Anheuser-Busch in 2011 and was with the company for over a decade. He told Fox News Digital he realized he needed to leave when DEI was preventing the brand from making what should have been no-brainer business decisions, like partnering with veteran-owned Black Rifle Coffee. “I joined a company that I thought was a great meritocracy, and then I saw the company really change, especially after 2020, 2021, when the DEI movement was really gaining steam,” Frericks said. The former executive left the company before the controversial 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The ensuing backlash, which included Kid Rock shooting cases of Bud Light and posting it online, haunts the company to this day. Sales were down nearly 30% year over year in January 2025. Frericks said Bud Light was pressured by outside interest groups, like the Human Rights Campaign, to go more and more extreme with LGBTQ advocacy and ultimately wound up alienating its core customer base. “It was authentically a brand that was about sports and humor and bringing people together. It never got involved in really politicized issues… and Dylan Mulvaney was the face of a lot of these very polarizing topics.” Frericks said. Mulvaney, who appeared on “The View” Monday to promote her new book “Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,” said she was shocked by the backlash. “Well, I will start by saying I love beer, and I always have,” Mulvaney said. “So, I mean, when I took that deal, I didn’t think anything of it, because I was, like, ‘Oh, this is perfect.’ It felt like an organic thing to do, and it was just another part of me… [but as the outcry continued to grow] I realized I had become the poster child for this thing.” Frericks, who went on to found Strive Asset Management with Vivek Ramaswamy, said that a convergence of outside factors pressured Bud Light into embracing an ever-increasing rubric of DEI policies that ultimately led to disaster for the business. He pointed to large asset managers like BlackRock pressuring companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and DEI policies because of the money they received from pension funds in progressive states like California and New York, as well as European markets. Last month, BlackRock leadership told employees the company was shifting away from its DEI policies. The former executive claimed Bud Light having a European owner, InBev, caused it to lose sight of the American values the brand had come to represent. In Frericks’ view, it is normal for business and government to collude to influence social outcomes in Europe, but that kind of partnership was antithetical to Bud Light’s business values and alienating to its customer base in the United States. “They abide by really different rules over in Europe. Europe is a very pro-ESG, pro-DEI continent,” he said. After the backlash from customers, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth issued a statement that did not directly mention Budweiser’s partnership with Mulvaney and that critics panned as falling short of an apology. Still, Bud Light became the official beer of the UFC and enlisted comedian Shane Gillis to star in a well-received ad that aired during the Super Bowl. The ad, which featured Gillis and rapper Post Malone playing “Big Men on the Cul De Sac,” was praised by critics and fans. Frericks, however, says that for Bud Light to truly recover, a true apology is in order, and perhaps the company should even consider leaving its European parent company and finding an American owner. “I always say the path to redemption, it goes through forgiveness,” Frericks said. He added that Bud Light needs to admit they “screwed up” and ask customers for a “second chance.” Anheuser-Busch, Mulvaney, and BlackRock didn’t respond to requests for comment. Advertisement

Title: Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over—It’s Just Changing, Says Analyst
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-isnt-over-its-just-changing/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:00:24Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a period marked by extraordinary polarization, market participants find themselves torn between two opposing camps: one steadfastly predicting that the current dip is merely a setup for an impending altcoin rally, and the other resolute that the broader crypto bull run has already reached its conclusion. In a post on X, Koroush Khaneghah, Founder of Zero Complexity Trading, stated, “Right now is the most divided timeline I’ve ever seen. Bulls believe this is the last dip before an Altseason. Bears think bull run is over.” According to Khaneghah, “It’s becoming more challenging to ‘predict’ cycle stages as crypto matures.” He highlights developments that did not appear in previous cycles, including a shift from a traditional altseason to a memecoin season, Ethereum (ETH) still not breaking its all-time highs, and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing its ATH and moving beyond $100K+ (an outcome absent in earlier cycles) 1. This Cycle Is Different From Others Khaneghah points to growing institutional involvement—an element noticeably absent in earlier bull markets. He cites data suggesting that BlackRock is currently holding nearly $52 billion worth of BTC (via Arkham). In his view, this significantly boosts the long-term buy pressure for Bitcoin, leading to potentially shallower pullbacks since “institutions will keep buying.” Because of heightened institutional interest, Khaneghah expects BTC dominance to continue rising. This dynamic could change how capital rotates into altcoins: “In this cycle, altcoins have seen Capital Dispersion. Meaning, more assets are in the market and liquidity is spread across multiple sectors, stopping any ONE sector from pumping hard.” He contrasts the memecoin market with DeFi. In the previous cycle, the memecoin market was roughly half the size of DeFi. In this cycle, memecoin market capitalization has equaled that of DeFi. If this scenario holds, Khaneghah believes BTC will remain the focal point for major moves while altcoins experience more fragmented, micro bull runs. “This means previous bull run playbooks won’t apply and you simply have to trade rotations,” he notes. 2. The Bull Run Is Not Over Khaneghah observes that BTC has only run 1.6x above the previous cycle highs before pulling back, calling it “not what a normal blow-off top/bubble looks like.” From a historical standpoint, BTC has frequently retraced by 40-50% from its ATH prior to surging higher. In the current cycle, BTC has only retraced about 26% from its peak, suggesting the possibility of more upside if past patterns repeat. A common bull-run trigger, according to many analysts, is ETH surpassing its prior cycle high—something yet to occur, given that ETH has not yet breached $4,000. Khaneghah posits that this lag might indicate a delayed altseason and a much longer overall cycle than expected. For altcoins to regain momentum, Khaneghah sees the ETH/BTC pair as a critical indicator. A bottom in ETH/BTC, combined with a rotation of capital from memecoins into other utility sectors such as DeFi and RWA (Real World Assets), could reignite altcoin rallies. Khaneghah concludes that traders need not be fixated on either the bull or bear side: “If you’re a trader, you don’t have to marry a bias or commit to scenario 1 or 2. If BTC dominance continues, trade BTC by longing strength and shorting weakness. -If alts start to bottom, shift capital there and buy the strongest coins.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,786.

Northvolt, the electric vehicle battery maker founded by two former Tesla executives, has reached the end of the road after failing to secure additional funding. The Swedish company's board announced the bankruptcy on Wednesday, saying that it had "explored all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future." Northvolt said it faced multiple challenges in recent months that undermined its financial position, including growing capital costs and geopolitical instability, resulting in supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand. Despite support from lenders and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, the company failed to achieve the financial conditions required to continue operating. A Swedish court-appointed trustee is now set to oversee the sale of the business and its assets. "This is an incredibly difficult day for everyone at Northvolt," Northvolt's interim chair, Tom Johnstone, said in a statement. "We set out to build something groundbreaking — to drive real change in the battery, EV, and wider European industry and accelerate the transition to a green and sustainable future." Northvolt aimed to become Europe's main EV battery manufacturer and counter the dominance of Chinese rivals such as CATL and BYD. It was founded in 2016 by Peter Carlsson and Paolo Cerruti and had raised more than $15 billion from investors including Volkswagen, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Baillie Gifford, and Spotify cofounder Daniel Ek. Northvolt grappled with escalating debts, operational efficiencies, and a reliance on Chinese equipment that hindered its production capabilities. The bankruptcy affects Northvolt AB and its Swedish subsidiaries. Northvolt's German and North American businesses aren't filing for bankruptcy in their respective jurisdictions, though the court-appointed trustee and company lenders are set to determine their future. The collapse has come as European automakers struggle with weak demand for EVs and rising competition from Chinese rivals. Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time and cutting tens of thousands of jobs because of weak EV demand and excess capacity. Last week, Mercedes-Benz announced staff buyouts and half-salary reductions to improve earnings following a decline in sales in 2024. Ford, meanwhile, said last November it would cut 4,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2027. Jump to

Title: Trump administration halts $1 billion program that keeps aging affordable housing livable

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/12/2025 4:22:14 AM PDT by Oldeconomybuyer The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans. Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it’s a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation’s housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans. On it’s face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing. This money “was essential in order for the project to come together,” said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. “Projects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.” he news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options — most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year. The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it’s first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments. “In all honesty,” said Michelle Arevalos, Smith Tower’s administrator, “if this building were not here, a lot of our folks actually probably would be homeless.” (Excerpt) Read more at apnews.com ...

Title: BlackRock/iShares Target Allocation 60/40 Model ETF Portfolio (Meant for Advisors)
URL: https://www.mymoneyblog.com/blackrock-ishares-target-allocation-model-etf-portfolio.html
Time Published: 2025-03-12T08:30:23Z
Full Content:
My Money Blog As a companion to my post on Fidelity Model ETF Portfolios, I also found Blackrock’s version of their 60/40 Model ETF portfolio. The was prompted by the fact that Blackrock recently announced that it was adding a 1-2% allocation to Bitcoin in their model ETF portfolios. The world’s biggest asset manager is finally allowing Bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio universe. BlackRock Inc. is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, according to an investment outlook viewed by Bloomberg. Of course, this coincided with the fact that last year they finally launched their own Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT). That made me wonder, what exactly does Blackrock put into these model portfolio that are meant for advisors? The model portfolio below does not have the Bitcoin ETF added yet: As with the Fidelity model portfolio, and probably all model portfolios meant for advisors, there is the appearance of technical complexity, with a lot of tiny allocations to ETFs to bump the total number involved to 18 different ETFs and cash (and possibly the new Bitcoin ETF as well). 1% to the iShares US Infrastructure ETF? 1% to iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF? 1% to iShares Gold Trust? However, what surprised me the most was hidden in their performance stats at the bottom. With a relatively low net weighted expense ratio of 0.16%, their gross overall performance (before all fees) was pretty good and hugged the benchmark indexes very closely. However, they had to disclose that their NET historical performance (what clients actually got) was a lot lower… why was it so much lower? Because their managed portfolio apparently comes with a 3% annual fee, charged quarterly!!! Tucked deep at the bottom: Net composite returns reflect the deduction of an annual fee of 3.00% typically deducted quarterly. Due to the compounding effect of these fees, annual net composite returns may be lower than stated gross returns less stated annual fee. So you put your Managed Portfolio clients in a low-cost ETF portfolio, and then add a 3% annual fee on top. Wow, that’s… wow. I have trouble even believing it. I must be reading this wrong. Another interesting note is that Vanguard’s new CEO, Salim Ramji, was the former global head of iShares and index investments at BlackRock and thus very involved in their push into model ETF portfolios and probably had a big hand in designing them. Will he adjust Vanguard’s suggested portfolios in a similar manner? Hi Jonathan. So are AOA, AOR, and AOM also adding Bitcoin? I don’t think so; if they do they’d have to make a change to their prospectus. Got it. Thanks Jonathan! 3% charged quarterly. My oh my. I wonder what the cumulative effect of that is on the amount that someone needs to invest to reach a typical retirement balance (e.g., over the course of your 50 working years, you need to save $XX more to compensate for the fees taken by your advisor). I’m wondering if the 3% annual rate fee deducted quarterly is actually paid to the advisor, and this is essentially a “loaded” fund. If so, then Blackrock is just a conduit for the advisor’s compensation/commission. Loaded funds are a common way for advisors to be compensated in a manner that is not very visible to the client (A-shares, B-shares, etc.). Some people paying fees this way actually think that their advisor doesn’t charge them anything and provides their services for free. This fund is a prime example of the hocus-pocus that some advisors (typically the commission-based types) like to sell to clients — that complexity with all these 18 investment categories makes it better, and that’s why the client “needs” an advisor. This is the fake “value-add” that they are selling, along with the guise of “this is an exclusive/premium thing not available to people who don’t use an advisor.” It’s just smoke and mirrors with a high cost.

Title: Larry Fink: Expect Inflation Prior to AI and Robot Economy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/03/12/larry-fink-technology-and-productivity-can-cut-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T08:11:17Z
Full Content:
BlackRock founder Larry Fink is warning President Donald Trump’s MAGA policies might cause some inflation before emerging technology allows American citizens to earn higher wages without inflation. The mega-investor on Wall Street told a March 10 conference hosted by S&P Global: When I go to Washington, when they talk about these [MAGA] policies, I ask “At what cost are you willing to tolerate [wage-driven inflation]? Yes, we may have opportunities to create better and more robust jobs, but then the offside of that will be, it will probably create a little more elevated inflation in the short run. The “little more” inflation from rising wages can be reversed by productivity gains from emerging technology, Fink said. The “big deflation because of the advancement of AI and robots … is going to reshape the economy,” Fink said. Foreign companies are already deploying the new technology that also shrinks inflation, he said: I was with an Asian CEO that builds phones and they’re now applying AI robots — robots that have much more tensile dexterity, that they believe over the course of the next two years, their workforce will be down 30 percent with the advent of more technology and more robotics. If you translate that across all the economies, we’re going to have shortage of [workers for] some things, like I said, in construction and electricians, and we’re going to have job [reductions] in many other industries that robots through AI are going to [cause]. China has invested heavily in robots and automation and leads the world in manufacturing output and in manufacturing technology. Fink described the balancing act that faces Trump and his deputies: With the whole idea that we’re going to have to use private capital to build up this economy, are we going to have enough workers? I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers. Trump’s promise of low migration and Fink’s worries about shortages of agriculture workers, construction crews, and electricians are good news for Trump’s blue-collar voters and their teenage children. That is because labor shortages ensure U.S. workers and their families gain higher wages — and also ensure companies will buy high-tech machinery to help them get more work and wages each day. That result would be good news for GOP politicians because wage gains will likely prompt happy citizens to vote for Trump and GOP politicians in the 2026 midterm elections. Rising wages “are good for national politics if you’re a politician, for sure,” then-U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News in 2020. “If you look the other side of your question: ‘Are decreasing wages good for national politics?’ Hell, no.” Many of these wage and productivity gains will be delivered by the foreign companies that are moving investment into the United States under Trump’s threat of tariffs. But those wage and productivity gains, however, will be sunk if Trump and GOP legislators agree to import more migrants or H-1B visa workers because of loud demands from employers, investors, donors, ethnic politicians, Democrats, and their chorus of pro-migrant establishment journalists. Fink manages $10 trillion of investments in many companies. His job requires him to balance his investors’ demands for maximum short-term profits and stock-price gains against other demands for the research and investment that create long-term innovation, productivity, and general prosperity. In April 2024, Fink suggested American politicians should grow wealth via investment instead of via President Joe Biden’s policy of extracting migrant consumers, renters, and wage-cutting workers from poor countries. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. But on Monday’s event in Houston, Fink focused on the near-term inflation expected as Trump rolls back Biden’s mass legal and illegal migration. Fink argued: I do believe deportations — and the speed at which it is happening — is going to have a severe impact on the agricultural sector [and] the construction sector. I’ve talked to CEOs in the ag sector, and they remind me that 70 percent of the men and women who work in agriculture were not born in the United States. Many are U.S. citizens. Now many of them have work permits and many of them don’t. Now 40 percent of the construction workers were not born in the United States. You add that up and what’s going on? I think … are we going to have enough workers to harvest the crops? Biden’s high-migration economy reduced wage-driven inflation by importing several million migrant workers. For example, wages rose by less than 1 percent from January 2024 to January 2025 under Biden’s policies. But Biden’s deputies forgot that migrants need housing, food, and autos — and those prices zoomed upwards as roughly 12 million migrants crowded into the United States. The resulting consumer-caused inflation caused massive political problems for Biden and his Democrats. Trump has ended Biden’s migration policy, so he faces no additional consumer-caused inflation. But he and his deputies are zig-zagging forward, by welcoming modest wage gains for Americans while hoping those wage gains do not drive up prices and inflation. So far, Trump’s deputies are deporting perhaps 2 million foreign criminals and migrants already ordered home by judges. Many other migrants are in hiding, some are being caught during workplace visits, and some are voluntarily going home — but there is no sign that Trump’s deputies are already targeting agriculture workers or construction crews. There are millions of unemployed American men and women who might replace deported migrants. At least 5 million demoralized or alienated men have fallen out of the labor force since 2000 and are not officially counted as unemployed. Many can be cajoled, shamed, enticed, or pushed back into the workforce once companies run out of cheap workers. The return of the sidelined workers will reduce pressure for further wage gains, and so reduce inflation. U.S. companies will also likely increase efforts to raise productivity via high-tech automation, just as they did in Trump’s first term. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: July 31 hearing date for 1MDB bid to freeze RM1.6bil of Rosmah's assets

Wednesday, 12 Mar 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court here has fixed July 31 to hear the injunction application by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and 10 other companies to prevent Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor (pic) from withdrawing or disposing of any of her assets totalling more than US$346mil (RM1.6bil). This is in relation to the suit filed against the wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and another individual over the purchase of luxury items totalling that amount, allegedly obtained through the misappropriation of 1MDB funds. Lawyer Villasha Anbalagan, representing 1MDB and the 10 companies, said Justice Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya set the hearing date during online case management on Wednesday (March 12). ALSO READ: Rosmah agrees not to sell disputed luxury items "The application will be heard on July 31 at 10.30am via Zoom before Justice Wan Muhammad Amin," the lawyer said when contacted. Rosmah's counsel Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam said that on the same day, the court would also hear his client's application for further particulars regarding the plaintiffs' allegations in their statement of claim. The Mareva injunction application was filed by 1MDB and five subsidiaries – 1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited and SRC International Sdn Bhd – as the first to sixth plaintiffs. The five other companies are Affinity Equity International Partners Limited; Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited and Brightstone Jewellery Limited, as the seventh to 11th plaintiffs. They are seeking, among others, an injunction to prevent Rosmah from disposing of assets amounting to US$346mil, whether in the form of credit, company shares, real estate, or others. ALSO READ: Rosmah still faces multiple court cases A Mareva injunction is a temporary order that restrains the defendant from disposing of assets until a decision is reached in the case between the plaintiffs and the defendant. On May 9 last year, 1MDB and 10 other companies filed a lawsuit naming Rosmah and a woman named Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) as the first and second defendants. They are seeking a court order demanding that Rosmah pay US$346,010,489 or an amount deemed appropriate by the court. The plaintiffs are seeking declarations that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, which are purportedly in Rosmah’s possession. – Bernama Thank you for your report!

Title: Rahul Jacob: Global alliances have changed and so have German policies

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Whether John Maynard Keynes said, “When the facts change, I change my mind" is often disputed, but the witticism has never seemed more apt. German chancellor-to-be Friedrich Merz, long a fiscal hawk as the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), recently made an about-turn on the virtues of higher deficit spending after being briefed on the country’s dwindling growth prospects and witnessing geopolitical gyrations in the US, which seems keen to patch up with Russia, potentially leaving its European allies in the lurch. The irony is that Merz campaigned as a fiscal conservative ahead of last month’s German elections, which delivered a victory for the CDU and its allies. Merz is also a former executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. This month, it spent $23 billion buying ports from CK Hutchison, including two in Panama. Although Hutchison is Hong Kong-based, Trump had warned against “Chinese" ownership and said he wanted US ownership of the Panama Canal. Also Read: Will Germany under Friedrich Merz script the EU’s independence from America?Merz had long been committed to stronger ties between the US and Europe, but with security alliances like Nato and Aukus now looking akin to a Scrabble board overturned by an unruly child, all is change. Early this month, Merz announced that his government would break the debt ceiling imposed on all German administrations since the global financial crisis to raise defence and infrastructure budgets. This includes an infra fund of €500 billion that its alliance partner, the Social Democratic Party, had campaigned for. Cumulatively, this would dramatically widen Germany’s fiscal deficit, but with GDP growth flat for two years and major industries (such as automobiles) in crisis, this is a good time for a Keynesian stimulus. Germany’s fiscal deficit was 2.8% of GDP last year and its total government debt is well below that of other large European countries. In a rousing speech, Merz vowed a “whatever it takes" approach to defence in the face of “threats to freedom and peace" in Europe. It was a clear reaction to the new world disorder. The CDU and its allies are now expected to rush through a debt-ceiling tweak before the term of this parliament ends because they need a two-thirds majority to do so. Also Read: Germany’s economic crisis offers it an opportunity to break an old gridlockSignificantly, asset markets cheered. “The steepening German yield curve, rising stock prices, euro appreciation, and stable credit default swap prices collectively indicate that markets interpret Germany’s fiscal expansion as growth-enhancing rather than a reckless fiscal bet," according to a paper by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The contrast with the market’s punishment of former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s fiscal adventurism in September 2022 could not have been more vivid. Farzad Saidi, author of the Kiel paper, wittily titled it ‘In Merz we Truss.’ Higher defence and infra spending is expected to revive German manufacturing, which has been in the doldrums. Retooling is already underway. The Financial Times outlined some aspects of it: a car parts factory being used to produce military equipment and a state-owned maker of sensors and radars looking to hire “teams of software engineers from Continental and Bosch, two of Germany’s largest automotive suppliers, which together have announced over 10,000 job cuts in the past year." Also Read: America First: Trump’s trade aggression could trigger another eurozone crisisFiscal policy aside, Germany’s leap of faith from cars to tanks is a 180° pivot from policies pursued since the middle of the last century. Germany has indicated it is open to discussions on a nuclear shield with France. Think-tanks estimate that Europe might need “300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion in the short term to deter Russian aggression." Across Europe, from Poland to Denmark, governments are raising defence budgets. As a response to the anarchy of announcements and tweets from the White House, this is simply sensible policy, given Washington’s apparent reversion to the Westphalian state system that arose from treaties at the end of the Thirty Years War in the 17th century. According to Oxford Reference, this means “a system of states… possessing the monopoly of force within their mutually recognized territories." If there is anything consistent in White House outbursts against Canada and Ukraine, it is this. European states, unsurprisingly, are forging closer ties in response.

For too long, India has been US-centric, apparent in the Indian rupee’s de facto peg to the US dollar on one hand and the slow track of negotiations with the EU for a free trade agreement (FTA) on the other. Talks on India’s EU FTA began in 2007, then stalled for several years, and are now on again.

As Merz has demonstrated, as the world order changes, governments need to respond at top speed. The author is a Mint columnist and a former Financial Times foreign correspondent. Merz had long been committed to stronger ties between the US and Europe, but with security alliances like Nato and Aukus now looking akin to a Scrabble board overturned by an unruly child, all is change. Early this month, Merz announced that his government would break the debt ceiling imposed on all German administrations since the global financial crisis to raise defence and infrastructure budgets. This includes an infra fund of €500 billion that its alliance partner, the Social Democratic Party, had campaigned for. Cumulatively, this would dramatically widen Germany’s fiscal deficit, but with GDP growth flat for two years and major industries (such as automobiles) in crisis, this is a good time for a Keynesian stimulus. Germany’s fiscal deficit was 2.8% of GDP last year and its total government debt is well below that of other large European countries. In a rousing speech, Merz vowed a “whatever it takes" approach to defence in the face of “threats to freedom and peace" in Europe. It was a clear reaction to the new world disorder. The CDU and its allies are now expected to rush through a debt-ceiling tweak before the term of this parliament ends because they need a two-thirds majority to do so.

The contrast with the market’s punishment of former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s fiscal adventurism in September 2022 could not have been more vivid. Farzad Saidi, author of the Kiel paper, wittily titled it ‘In Merz we Truss.’ Higher defence and infra spending is expected to revive German manufacturing, which has been in the doldrums. Retooling is already underway. The Financial Times outlined some aspects of it: a car parts factory being used to produce military equipment and a state-owned maker of sensors and radars looking to hire “teams of software engineers from Continental and Bosch, two of Germany’s largest automotive suppliers, which together have announced over 10,000 job cuts in the past year."

Germany has indicated it is open to discussions on a nuclear shield with France. Think-tanks estimate that Europe might need “300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion in the short term to deter Russian aggression." Across Europe, from Poland to Denmark, governments are raising defence budgets. As a response to the anarchy of announcements and tweets from the White House, this is simply sensible policy, given Washington’s apparent reversion to the Westphalian state system that arose from treaties at the end of the Thirty Years War in the 17th century. According to Oxford Reference, this means “a system of states… possessing the monopoly of force within their mutually recognized territories."

Title: SEC postpones altcoin ETF decisions but 2025 approval prospects remain strong

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart assessed that the delays were expected, and the odds of approval for altcoin ETFs this year are still relatively high. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed various altcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 11. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the approval odds for these ETFs this year are still relatively high. Decisions on Grayscale’s filings for Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) ETFs were delayed. The SEC also delayed decisions for XRP ETFs filed by Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21shares. The regulator also postponed decisions on the Solana (SOL) ETFs filed by 21shares, Canary, and VanEck. Canary’s Litecoin filing was the last altcoin-related ETF delay. Other crypto ETF delays include in-kind creation and redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT, as well as Fidelity’s FBTC and FETH. 21shares also saw a delay in the proposal to include staking in its Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Despite the delays, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Hedera (HBAR) ETF and Bitwise’s DOGE-related filing. Additionally, on March 11, Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 Form for an XRP ETF, joining a new altcoin exchange-traded product race. Seyffart assessed that the multiple delays were expected, as “this is standard procedure.” He added that Paul Atkins has not been confirmed as the new SEC chair, which is also a factor in the delays. The analyst also highlighted that the final deadlines for an SEC decision on all ETFs are due in October and that the odds of approval are still relatively high. In February, Seyffart and Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas published their approval odds for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs. LTC leads the odds with a 90% probability of approval this year, with DOGE holding the second-largest percentage at 75%. SOL trails close behind with 70% chances, and XRP with a 65% chance of approval. The analysts highlighted that these odds were less than 5% before President Donald Trump’s November election, making the new numbers relatively high. Moreover, the odds for all ETFs listed by Balchunas and Seyffart could go up if regulatory conditions in the US improve even further.

Title: Trump defends tariffs, meets corporate America as economic fears nip stocks

World President Donald Trump speaks at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2025, as Business Roundtable Chair and Cisco Chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins listens at right. (Pool via AP) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump defended his tariff policies on Tuesday (Mar 11) as he met the CEOs of America's biggest companies, including many whose market value has dipped in recent days as recession and inflation fears soured consumer and investor sentiment. The Republican president spoke to about 100 CEOs at a regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, an influential group of CEOs leading major US companies, which include Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart. Trump met with technology company executives at the White House on Monday. Trump said his increased tariffs on many imports, which have rattled global markets and prompted stock selloffs, will have a tremendously positive impact over time. "The tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money for this country" and entice companies abroad to build plants in the United States, he said. Trump's economic policies so far have centered on a blitz of tariff announcements. Some of the levies have taken effect and others have been delayed or are set to kick in later. He said they will correct unbalanced trade relations, bring jobs back to the country and stop the flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. He ramped up a burgeoning trade war with Canada, vowing to double tariffs set to take effect within hours on all imported steel and aluminum products from America's northern neighbor to 50 per cent. The White House said later the tariff would remain at 25 per cent after Canadian officials agreed to talks. Markets have been spooked by the prospect that tariffs could raise prices for businesses, boosting inflation, and undermine consumer confidence in a blow to economic growth. US stocks on Tuesday extended last week's selloff that has dragged the benchmark S&P 500 down 3.6 per cent since Trump's election in November last year and 5.3 per cent so far in 2025. "Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country," Trump told reporters earlier. "Some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they're buying." Investors fear that Trump's trade policies could trigger an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, a survey of American households showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their prospects. Trump had already imposed an additional 20 per cent tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States, and 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, although he suspended most of the duties on US neighbours until Apr 2, when he plans to unveil a global regime of reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners. Trump said last month the policies could cause "short-term, some little pain" before delivering long-run benefits. In a Fox News interview aired over the weekend, he declined to predict whether his economic policies would cause a recession. "I don't see it at all," Trump said on Tuesday regarding a recession. Until recently, investors have been optimistic that Trump's policies would tip toward stimulating more growth, for instance through lower taxes, or easing inflationary pressures, for instance by loosening regulation on fossil fuel production. But tax cuts need congressional approval. And some economists see plans to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants increasing price pressures in the labor market, while cutting the federal workforce could raise unemployment. "I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me - that it's going to have elevated inflation," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a Business Roundtable member, at an industry conference on Monday. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group have cut their 2025 US growth forecast and raised their inflation forecast, "both on the back of more adverse tariff assumptions". The forecast remains positive for the year. Last week, the business advocacy group called for making the Trump tax cuts permanent and pushing forward with regulatory reform in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors, areas of broad alignment with the Trump administration. But the group also urged "negotiators to redouble efforts to secure a path forward that swiftly removes the recently implemented tariffs. These tariffs, especially if they are long-lasting, run the risk of creating serious economic impact". The group said the White House and Congress should preserve the benefits of the North American free trade deal with Mexico and Canada signed during Trump's first term.

Title: As Mandatory Sustainability Reporting Dies, Advocates Push Voluntary Disclosure
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/03/11/as-mandatory-sustainability-reporting-dies-advocates-push-voluntary-disclosure/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T21:36:00Z

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan , Contributor. Group of climate change demonstrators hold signs Within the past few years, sustainability reporting became a staple in business. As jurisdictions around the world developed mandatory reporting requirements, some companies rushed to be early adopters. It was a boom for the finance and sustainability industries, but the high costs caused businesses to push back. The trend towards mandatory reporting requirements has reversed, leaving activists and the sustainability industry pushing a new narrative for voluntary reporting. Whether businesses will buy the new line is still uncertain. The concept of sustainability reporting is not new, although the exact origins are difficult to trace. I have authored multiple legal journal articles on the topic, including a forthcoming one for UCLA Law, and every time I find a new origin story. Regardless of the tale, the premise is the same. A group of investors become concerned about a particular issue or action of a company. The investors decide that the issue they care about is more important than just financial returns. As a result, they invest or divest based on the non-financial consideration. In this case, climate change and environmental concerns. For an investor to make an informed decision on these other concerns, they need information. Most investors just look at financial statements. For non-financial considerations, investors have limited sources of information. Over the years, some socially conscious companies produced a form of sustainability report to attempt to appease the demand. However, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, international focus shifted to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. To accomplish this goal, countries needed the business sector to reduce GHG emissions. The starting point was gathering information. The push came from multiple angles, mostly originating from United Nations’ initiatives. Major investors had to be sold on the idea that climate change should be a consideration. That creates a demand. Major fund managers, like BlackRock, became actively engaged in the debate, influencing companies to start disclosing information and actions relating to an array of sustainability issues. By 2021, sustainability reports were common place in both publicly traded and privately held companies. They were trendy, but little more than marketing materials. No standardization existed. Some focused exclusively on environmental issues and climate change. Environmental, social, and governance reports took a broader approach, incorporating human rights issues and business ethics. In the U.S., ESG included diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as LGBTQ+ policies. There was a need for regulations to standardize the content. At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 29) in Glasgow, Scotland, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation announced the formation of the International Sustainability Standards Board “to develop—in the public interest—a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure standards to meet investors’ information needs." IFRS creates financial reporting standards that are used in over 140 jurisdictions around the world. The U.S. uses their own financial standards known as GAAP. The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards were released in June 2023. Based on the of Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, the ISSB created standards focused primarily on climate change and GHG emissions. The European Union was an early adopter and leader in the area of sustainability reporting. In November 2022, they adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requiring reporting by nearly all companies doing business in the EU. In July 2023, the EU adopted European Sustainability Reporting Standards to be used by companies reporting under the CSRD. The ESRS incorporated the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for climate reporting, but also included other ESG reporting requirements. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed climate related disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies in March 2022. The SEC adopted the rule in March 2024, relying heavily on the TCFD recommendations. By the end of 2023, the standardization of sustainability reporting was occurring at an international level. Simultaneously, jurisdictions around the world started establishing timelines for mandatory disclosure by 2026 for fiscal year 2025. Sustainability reporting quickly became a requirement of businesses. The decline of mandatory sustainability reporting was swift. As the early adopter, the EU was also the first to run into issues. When the first round of ESRS were released, businesses struggled to learn and prepare for sustainability reporting. Implementation of an entirely new area of financial reporting was never going to be easy, but the EU was over ambitious in their own ability to enforce such a requirement. The EU quickly delayed broader implementation of the CSRD, choosing to focus on providing better guidance for larger companies. That was the first chink in the armor. The real blow back came during the 2024 elections. In June, the EU held elections for the European Parliament. The EU economy was faltering and the European People’s Party placed the blame squarely on the European Green Deal and the requirements placed on businesses. It worked. The EPP gained seats, while environmentally focused parties lost seats. The shift wasn’t drastic, but enough to change the balance and embolden the business community. In December, the President of the European Commission announced that new legislation will be introduced to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on businesses by the CSRD and other climate directives. In February 2025, the final proposal was released in the form of the Omnibus Simplification Package. The proposal removes mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for most companies, limiting it to large companies with companies with over 1,000 employees and €450-plus million in annual net turnover. It also limits what large companies can request from SMEs. That proposal will now work through the legislative process over the next few months. The U.S. faced similar setbacks. The SEC climate related risk rule was immediately met with legal challenges, resulting in the SEC pausing implementation while the challenges worked through the courts. Similar to the EU, the November 2024 elections brought a shift to the right with the election of President Trump and Republicans gaining control of the House and Senate. Trump took immediate action when he was sworn in on January 20, 2025, issuing an executive order removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. In February, the acting chair of the SEC announced the commission will rollback the climate related disclosure rule. State level action in the U.S. is facing similar struggles. In 2023, California adopted Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. In 2024, the drafting of reporting standards was delayed and the 2026 reporting requirement for fiscal year 2025 was pushed back at least a year. Similar legislation in other states has lost support. Mandatory sustainability reporting is dying as quickly as it rose. While some high level of reporting may continue for major companies, protections are quickly being put into place to protect SMEs from being required to report, either directly or indirectly through being in a reporting entities value chain - a key aspect of climate reporting. Climate activists and sustainability experts are not giving up the fight. While the debate over mandatory reporting continues, the focus has shifted to voluntary reporting. Sustainability experts say that companies will continue with voluntary reporting, citing surveys and public statements by companies. Advocates are pushing the notion that companies have a moral obligation to continue the reporting. However, the debate has changed in the past few years. Sustainability reporting, as well as ESG reporting, was easy until 2022. As noted earlier, they were little more than marketing materials, often created by the marketing department. Feel good statements about helping the environment with little data to back it up. Standardization through regulation brings complexity and cost. Most estimates put the cost of creating a sustainability report under the SEC climate disclosure rule around $1 million initially plus high annual costs. Similar estimates exist in other jurisdictions. That is the source of the push from the big accounting firms and associated providers. Sustainability reports is a financial boom for those industries, and those companies invested heavily gearing up for a demand driven my mandatory reporting. They are not quite ready to walk away from their investment. Therefore, they are pushing for voluntary reporting and creating a matching narrative. I have read multiple surveys over the past few months that show companies are going to continue with voluntary reporting, even if mandatory reporting requirements go away. I don’t believe them. The surveys primarily ask the opinion of chief sustainability officers, whose entire career is based on sustainability reporting. Of course they say their company will continue to do the reports. In late 2024, similar surveys were circulate about diversity, equity and inclusion. Three months into 2025, DEI officers are finding themselves out of work. This is driven by a number of factors, including that companies engaging in DEI in the U.S. are facing discrimination investigations by Attorney General Pam Bondi and state level AGs. Sustainability reporting is facing another legal issue that may provide the same result. In addition to the cost of producing sustainability reports, companies are now being challenged with lawsuits from both sides. Target was recently sued by Florida as a shareholder, stating that the company’s ESG and DEI policies reduced shareholder value. The evidence of this action includes Target’s ESG report. In Canada, Lululemon is facing a civil investigation for greenwashing based on claims made in their sustainability report. Around the world, climate activists are bringing civil claims against companies for GHG emission data and environmental claims made in sustainability reports. Overzealous and impatient climate activists may have jumped the gun in filing these suits, warning companies of the legal dangers of sustainability reports. The future of sustainability reporting is uncertain. There is a legitimate argument to be made that some companies should continue with voluntary reporting. Mandatory reporting may also face a revival. The EU has not officially stamped out the CSRD yet. State level reporting in the U.S. may get a renewed push. An outstanding opinion by the International Court of Justice on the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change may find that countries are obligated to require climate related reporting to reduce GHG emissions. Regardless, sustainability reporting will most certainly face another rebrand. For now, expect a passionate debate.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Bolt’s controversial co-founder Ryan Breslow, who returned as CEO earlier this month, spoke on Monday about the $30 million personal loan he took out of his company that sparked legal battles and contributed to his (temporary) ouster. Breslow also announced that Bolt will launch an “everything app” that will integrate one-click checkouts for everything from crypto to financial services “very soon.” The legal battle over the loan began in 2023, when Bolt investor Activant sued Breslow. Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back. The case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant’s shares for $37 million last year. Speaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was. He said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt’s board. “It was done to be pro-Bolt,” Breslow said. “I took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I’m not selling my shares.” Breslow said he thought he had plenty of time to pay back the loan and was waiting for Bolt to IPO to do so. He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as “a bit of an attack.” Breslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. On Monday, Breslow admitted he made “a ton of mistakes” — but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt’s cap table that he “did not know very well” (without specifying who). Now that he’s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new “super app” that will integrate Bolt’s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services. “Instead of one-click checkout, we’re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,” he said. Breslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, which was valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million “wallets” compared to Revolut’s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not “monetized our consumers yet.” Indeed, Bolt’s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year. That’s small compared to Revolut, which announced $2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone. The big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in “marketing credits” and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead. Some of Bolt’s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced today. Breslow noted during his speech that “all” the legal cases against him are “fully settled, dismissed” but didn’t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise. He did comment, though, that he’s been “humbled” by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself — and his startup — was challenged. “You know, I obviously make mistakes but I’ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,” he said. “I’m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.” BlackRock and Hedosophia didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Greenlane, which is building US-wide EV charging infrastructure for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, will open its flagship electric charging truck stop in Colton, California, next month. Builder and developer Mortenson is constructing the commercial EV charging facility in Colton, which broke ground last September. It will include more than 40 chargers when it comes online for heavy, medium, and light-duty EVs. In its next phase, Greenlane plans to deploy solar panels and battery storage to enhance grid stability, manage peak loads, and increase energy efficiency. Greenlane’s pull-through lane chargers will be equipped with Alpitronic CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers featuring oil-cooled cables. That means faster charging without the bulk—these cables stay lightweight and easy to handle. For bobtail charging, eFill CCS 180 kW chargers will be available, bringing smart energy management to keep fleet operations running smoothly. To keep everything in check, ABB’s SCADA system will handle remote monitoring and breaker management, boosting reliability and efficiency. Plus, Greenlane’s sites are built with Trenwa precast cable trench, making it easier to expand EV charging infrastructure and upgrade to megawatt charging as fleet demand grows. Greenlane, a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, also debuted its branded digital technology suite as part of its ongoing development of the I-15 Commercial EV Charging Corridor. The products will be rolled out in phases. Greenlane’s Chief Technology Officer, Raj Jhaveri, said, “Our technology helps maximize uptime and operational efficiency by ensuring vehicles are charged efficiently and ready to meet the demands of their freight schedules.” The tech rollout includes an app that allows drivers to check charger availability and make reservations in advance, a fleet portal that enables fleet managers and dispatchers to plan and manage routes for their electric fleets, and a new Greenlane website. Greenlane also now has OnRamp Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate with existing fleet solutions, providing fleet managers and drivers access to optimized routes, efficient charging and refueling schedules, and related charging data and emissions savings.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. The Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT) facility at the Port of Le Havre, France. Photo credit: France 2 via Hapag-Lloyd Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT), the terminal operating subsidiary of ocean carrier Hapag-Lloyd, has acquired a 60% stake in CNMP LH, which operates the Atlantique container terminal in Le Havre, France. The acquisition strengthens HGT’s presence in one of Europe’s top 10 ports and marks another step in its ambitious terminal expansion strategy. The remaining 40% stake will be retained by Seafrigo Group, a specialist in temperature-controlled food logistics. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Le Havre, France’s premier maritime gateway, handles approximately 3 million TEU annually and provides crucial connections to Paris. Industry analysts expect the CNMP LH terminal’s container throughput to increase in the coming years, particularly in the reefer container segment. HGT CEO Dheeraj Bhatia emphasized the strategic importance of the acquisition: “By acquiring a majority stake in the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre, we are strengthening our position in one of our core European markets. At the same time, we are continuing to expand our global terminal portfolio while paving the way for targeted investments to enhance efficiency.” The acquisition aligns with HGT’s Strategy 2030, which aims to expand its terminal portfolio from its current 21 terminals to more than 30 by the end of the decade. HGT, operating from Rotterdam, currently maintains a diverse portfolio spanning 12 countries across four continents, including significant operations through SAAM Terminals in Latin America and Florida, as well as a strong presence in India through J M Baxi. Seafrigo Group President Eric Barbé welcomed the partnership, stating, “We are very pleased to have a strong partner at our side in Hanseatic Global Terminals, with whom we will continue to modernize the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre.” The deal comes as HGT’s parent company, Hapag-Lloyd, the world’s fifth-largest ocean carrier, continues to expand its terminal operations. The company recently entered into the Gemini Partnership with Maersk, signaling a strategic shift in container shipping alliances. The latest acquisition reinforces the growing trend of major shipping lines investing in terminal infrastructure to secure their supply chains and enhance operational efficiency in key maritime gateways. Last week, a unit of Swiss-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company—the world’s largest ocean carrier—partnered with US-based BlackRock to acquire an 80% stake in Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports Holding for $22.8 billion, marking the largest port terminal acquisition in history. The acquisition gives MSC control of and additional 43 container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, extending from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity of over 73 million TEU and a 2023 throughput of nearly 47 million TEU.

Title: How COVID Changed Hip-Hop Forever
URL: https://www.complex.com/music/a/dimassanfiorenzo/how-covid-19-lockdown-affected-hip-hop
Time Published: 2025-03-11T18:28:53Z
Full Content:
COVID-19 lockdowns changed the way we live, sparking various technological innovations that rappers quickly embraced. Five years later, has it changed rap for the better? I still remember the last concert I attended before it all went to shit. G Herbo was performing at Brooklyn Steel, a midsize, no-frills venue located in a dead section of Williamsburg. It was February 27, 2020, and the Chicago rapper was set to drop his third album, PTSD, at midnight—a release that would be overshadowed by another album coming out that evening, Lil Baby’s breakout My Turn. Random moments from that show still stick with me: the multiple tributes to Pop Smoke and Juice WRLD, both of whom had died in the past two months; the kinetic energy from one of the openers, a young street rapper named King Von; and appearances from A Boogie wit da Hoodie and Fabolous, the two patron saints of regional New York City rap. But the lasting image I have—the one I can still see the sharpest—is one solitary figure behind me, watching the show while wearing a surgical mask. On March 11, just 13 days later, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19—a virus that had been spreading in China since November and had reached the U.S. by January—a pandemic. Within days, schools, venues, movie theaters, bars, and restaurants all shuttered. If your job involved sitting at a desk and staring at a screen, you were ordered to stay home. Zoom became the most downloaded non-game app in the world. The enforcement of lockdowns, which were an attempt to control the spread of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, was a seismic event that, in some ways, permanently altered the way we live. Stuck at home with Wi-Fi, iPhones, and an abundance of time, technology became the intermediary for almost all of our interactions. Tech companies—at least those not named Quibi—leveraged this moment, accelerating us towards a future where technology has a hand in every aspect of human life. In the process, it changed our relationship with culture. No entertainers benefitted as much as rappers, who had already built a head start due to the agile, direct-to-consumer approach they’ve adopted over the years. Hip-hop might have started out in the park, but entering its middle-age years, it showed it could be adaptable to being stuck in the crib. Almost instantly, rap took over the pandemic, finding ways to eventize their presence, while also uncovering ways to innovate. But where has this left us five years later? Since the end of the lockdown, concerns within the genre have grown louder. In 2023, the year hip-hop turned 50, no rapper hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart until the middle of July. Hip-hop’s market share has fallen for four consecutive years, dropping from 28.2 percent in 2020 to 24 percent in 2024. When you factor that in with the substantial growth of pop, country, and Latin, it’s hard to downplay the trend. This, compounded by a noticeable absence of younger rap stars, questions about the quality of the music, worries over stylistic shifts, and a lack of support from record labels, paints a concerning picture. Ironically, the genre's influence has never been more evident, with elements of hip-hop—its musical style, fashion, lingo, and distribution strategies—being adopted by nearly every other genre, from country to K-pop to regional Mexican music. (It's a somewhat fitting outcome, considering hip-hop became such a dominant force by borrowing from other genres.) The current hip-hop landscape has been shaped by trends that began in March 2020 and lasted until the spring of 2021, when vaccines became widely accepted. The question now is: Has this shift become permanent, or is it just an aberration—and is it all for the better or worse? A day before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, there was a warning that echoed louder than anything Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, “America's doctor,” had said up to that point. Cardi B, who had been sending out subtle warnings on various social platforms, went to Instagram and started ringing the alarm. “Coronavirus! Coronavirus! I’m telling you, shit is real! Shit is gettin' real!” That moment would be remixed, flipped, and turned into memes. But it also represents how ahead of the curve rappers were in recognizing the shifting times. While A-list celebrities were doing tone-deaf, cringe-worthy John Lennon covers—acting as if their presence alone made some sort of statement—rappers dove headfirst into the content frontlines, often meeting their audiences on their own terms. There were pandemic-era freestyles (Lil Uzi Vert), DJ sets (DJ Nice’s Club Quarantine), song battles on the 'gram (the first year of Verzuz), live sessions with artists just kicking it (Tory Lanez’s Quarantine Radio), rappers gaming on Twitch (Danny Brown), shouting matches on Clubhouse (everyone from 21 Savage to Meek Mill), and various TikTok attempts—remember Tyga’s “Bored in the House”? Speaking of TikTok, one of the first big challenges of lockdown was the #SavageChallenge, in support of Megan Thee Stallion’s single of the same name. “The pandemic was such a defining moment; it marked a clear difference between pre-2020 and post-2020,” Kojo Osei, senior director of digital marketing at Interscope, told me recently. At the time, Osei was doing digital marketing for 300 Entertainment, where before the pandemic he often saw old-school approaches still dominating. “Things are a lot more digitally focused now. Even artists are more tech-savvy. It’s a younger batch of artists coming up, compared to when I first started, when I’d have to coach some artists or give them new ideas that were foreign at the time. TikTok existed, but there weren’t many artists on it. It was a battle just to get them on there.” The era of mixtapes and freestyles—essentially illegitimate music—primed rappers in many ways to go all in, almost in a guerrilla fashion. For years, producers Mike and Keys, previously known as The Futuristics, got an education in branding and marketing by working closely with Nipsey Hussle, a master of direct-to-consumer distribution and innovative marketing tactics, like selling a mixtape for $1,000. Now, the duo, who recently cut tracks with burgeoning West Coast figures LaRussell and Lefty Gunplay, sees themselves thinking more entrepreneurially to stay ahead of the game. “You have to be a content creator,” Keys told me. “To keep it 1000, people forced us to do that, and we didn't want to do it at first, but I know things grow into something else. That's just how life is.” This mindset was honed during the pandemic and has now become the normal mode of operation. Why wait for a label when you can drop 100 gigs of shit on your own site? Got a new song? Throw it on the ‘gram, fuck it. Something controversial happens? Skip the journalist—go live and address it yourself. Want to know how I made a song? Watch me spend an hour with Plaqueboymax punching in vocals live on stream. Some rappers have expressed ambivalent feelings about this, like when ScHoolboy Q dismissively called modern rappers "content creators," or when Polo G joked about getting into streaming for monetary reasons. But the point remains: There are clear benefits to being in charge of the content you create. And, because of the surge of online content during the pandemic, audiences are now primed to engage with experiences that go beyond just music. Songs matter, of course, but there’s also lore, inside references, story arcs, leaks, and slang—all contributing to a more immersive, actively engaged experience. TikTok, which was originally Musical.ly, had been around for a couple of years before 2020. But TikTok culture in many ways started with the pandemic. The app saw 180 percent growth among people aged 15 to 25, partly due to TikTok's billions spent on user acquisition. The most obvious impact of the app has been the rise of the algorithmically driven "For You" page, a feature that has since spread to other popular social platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Spotify. In the span of a decade, the way music is discovered has shifted from blogs to large editorial playlists, and now to algorithms, with listeners becoming their own tastemakers. This shift has made it easier for artists to connect with audiences and home in on a specific sound. “I feel like discovery is difficult, and once you do discover it, which is great, you end up in this pocket,” Sophie Ash, manager for Mike and Keys, told me. Ash started her career working with Nipsey Hussle and has had stops at Def Jam and Beyoncé’s Parkwood. “In order to have success in this industry now, I think you need to have very close relationships with your fans and take a [direct-to-consumer] approach with it.” While TikTok has often been framed as an app for discovering music—and, in fact, record labels have looked at it as a platform to launch hits—it hasn’t necessarily been a reliable venue for star-making in hip-hop. Sure, it’s been effective for achieving buzz quickly, but the platform has more or less settled into its role of churning out modern-day “turntable hits”—songs that capture attention and generate some revenue but don’t necessarily lead to sustainable careers. Meanwhile, rappers who have hammered away at one sound—e.g., the members of Griselda or Rod Wave—are finding ways to build engagement and build sturdy followings. "In this industry now, success really comes down to those close connections,” Ash said. “The current landscape feels vast, with no clear barriers to entry, but the communities are tighter.” The era of relying on editorial recommendations has been completely overtaken by algorithms that reward constant engagement, which in the process causes listeners to dive deeper into their own silos. As a result, micro-communities thrive and evolve, while mainstream artists struggle to keep up with the changing landscape. During the height of the lockdowns, pluggnb—an offshoot of the plugg music scene that emerged in the mid-2010s—exploded, with streams for the genre surging sixfold, according to SoundCloud. In 2020, the usage of the “pluggnb” tag tripled on the platform, before more than quadrupling the following year, partly due to the virality of artists like Summrs and Autumn!. From there, the scene splintered even more, evolving into microgenres like darkplugg, emoplugg, dreamplugg, and sadplugg. In the wake of lockdown, SoundCloud also reports spikes in internet-centric genres like jerk. From afar, these micro-scenes can look the same to a skeptic, but if you get closer, you start to see the details. You want to shit on drill? Fine. But which drill are you talking about? Philly drill (which is dramatic, slow-building, and epic)? DMV drill (spastic and intense)? Or maybe New York drill (which can either be party music or aggressive, depending on the borough)? Or you want to talk about underground rap? Cool. But what does that mean? Are we talking about older rappers creating dense, philosophical tracks like billy woods or Mach-Hommy? Or the kids making noisy, messy, rage-filled music? And if it's the latter, what underground sub sector are you speaking of? The New York-centric version that Xaviersobased represents? Or the aura, rockstar-adjacent corner Nettspend occupies? “Regional music is definitely making a comeback, especially since the pandemic. There are more defined sounds coming from New York, whether that's drill or the Slizzy sound, from Detroit rap, Atlanta, or the West Coast,” Osei told me. “But then, there’s also the boundaryless underground scene, where location isn’t the defining factor—the internet is the ‘location’ and the sounds are more creative and experimental.” In 2025, artists aren’t necessarily incentivized to reach the largest audiences possible. In fact, what makes young rappers so exciting is their apparent desire to subvert the need for mass reach, choosing instead to focus on cultivating their own dedicated fanbases. But how far can that strategy really take you? So far, the most successful new example is someone like Yeat, who took Playboi Carti’s rage soundscape and ran with it, essentially creating his own world with his own language and a loyal fanbase that has delivered him a No. 1 album. Yet, despite his success, he still finds himself in what feels like a kind of star purgatory. In this environment, the idea of a single rap king feels more outdated than ever. Last year, the Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake beef was the dominant unifying force in music. What often went unspoken was that this could be the last time we see something like this—two universally recognized rap all-time greats, in terms of both commercial success and artistic ability, vying for the top spot. “I felt like the whole ‘Big Three’ and all that beef was the last big, culture-defining moment from that class of rappers,” Osei said. “Because you talk to the new kids listening to the newer artists, they're not as diehard about it compared to the people over 25 or those with a more traditional take on hip-hop.” In exploring this topic and tracing trends from the pandemic to now, I wanted to get the perspective of someone who's been around for decades but still has some skin in the game. This led me to Rene McLean, who, alongside his wife, Lylette Pizarro McLean, co-founded Influence Media, the BlackRock-invested company who has bought catalogs from artists like Lil Durk and Future. Before that, he was a manager and veteran in the music industry, with stints at RCA and Elektra. While acknowledging that hip-hop is in a bit of a “transitional place” right now, he remains optimistic about the future. To put it bluntly: McLean has seen this shit before. And there is more he’s encouraged by, including the fact that rappers can age gratefully now, than he is dismayed about. “Right before the SoundCloud era, you had all this glossy rap with no new ideas, nothing fresh, nothing groundbreaking. But there was also a creative undercurrent that went counter to that. We got artists like XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert, who emerged during that time, leading to the next generation,” McLean said. “So I just feel like we’re in that same time period now. We went through something similar 15 to 20 years before [that], when Wu-Tang showed up.” I tend to agree with McLean. These smaller scenes—which admittedly can be rough around the edges—is why I'm still bullish on rap. No other genre is as diverse as hip-hop. And rappers are finding ways to prosper in their own cocoons. Rap is messy but also hyperfocused, largely because that also describes the most engaged and invested fan. If the rap stars from the last decade were regional acts trying to transcend by aggregating other regional sounds—à la Drake and Kanye West—this decade feels like a correction, with regional, scene-representing rappers solidifying their place in their own lanes. This is the biggest way COVID-19 changed hip-hop: It was an event that triggered a flood of content, overwhelming the traditional mechanisms that once propelled certain artists to the top. The main innovation during that 16-month stretch was actually an evolution—a shift from communal, outward-facing spaces to more localized corners of the internet, where things became exclusive and harder to penetrate. To me, it’s not a coincidence that there was a surge in success for middle-class rappers making boom-bap-adjacent music, such as Freddie Gibbs, MIKE, and Boldy James. And as the lockdowns eased—with fans needing to release pent-up energy—you saw the rise of high-energy subgenres like Jersey Club and gnarly moshpit rap, thanks partially to the success of Carti’s magnum opus, Whole Lotta Red. “You got a lot of music that’s merged with hip-hop, that are part of subcultures of it, but not completely in the mainstream context of what rap is,” McLean said. “Carti, to me, is the illest shit in the world right now. The dude is number 43 in the fuckin’ world on Spotify, and the motherfucker hasn’t dropped a new album.” Five years after the pandemic, hip-hop is still large and important (I mean, Kendrick just performed at the Super Bowl). But it’s also more fragmented, a little stranger, and a bit all over the place. Ultimately, this is healthy for rap as a genre. I can’t speak for the industry, though. “Sometimes business doesn’t align with what needs to be done creatively, and then it all aligns,” McLean tells me. “They just have to realign.” Rolling Loud RL 10 Black Soccer Jersey Destroy Lonely LOVE LASTS FOREVER Exclusive Metallic Platinum Vinyl Rolling Loud RL 10 Year Mechanic Tan Jacket Quavo Quavo & Takeoff "Only Built for Infinity Links" Exclusive 2LP Follow On Discover Shop Work with us Sign Up for the Newsletter By entering your email, you agree to receive customized marketing messages from us and our advertising partners.

Title: BlackRock CEO Issues Inflation Warning, Says President Trump’s ‘Nationalistic’ Policies To Trigger Higher Prices

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is reportedly warning that President Trump’s new shift into nationalist-style economic policy may stoke a new wave of inflation. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference – and energy markets conference run by S&P Global – Fink says markets are currently discounting inflation, and that US industries will likely experience higher costs in the next six to nine months, Reuters reports. Fink suggests that the potential for millions of migrant workers to be deported and the subsequent shrinking of the labor supply could contribute to inflation. “I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic – and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me – that it’s going to have elevated inflation.” Are we going to have enough workers to harvest this now? I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” Commenting on the tariffs, Fink says, “When I go to Washington, when they talk about these policies, at what cost are you willing to tolerate that?” Fink’s comments come after BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with over $11.6 trillion in total assets, led a consortium to acquire CK Hutchison, a company that operates in over 43 ports across 23 countries, including the Panama Canal. The CEO has previously touted Bitcoin (BTC) as a legitimate inflation hedge, and earlier this year at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, said the flagship crypto asset could run as high as $700,000 in the event that sovereign wealth funds start allocating. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: WATCH: The stunning truth about China and the Panama Canal

By David Kupelian March 11, 2025 Democrats in Congress hate it. “It’s bananas. It’s insane,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D.-Conn., told CNN. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D.-Fla., agrees: “It is utterly preposterous to suggest that we are going to send our military into Panama to, quote, ‘take back the Panama Canal.'” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks for virtually all his congressional peers when he insists, “House Democrats believe that we are not sent to Washington to invade Greenland, rename the Gulf of Mexico or seize the Panama Canal by force!” But as President Donald Trump stated explicitly during his March 4 speech to Congress, the nation and the world: “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal – and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The Panama Canal, Trump pointed out, “was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria, they died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die – the most expensive project also that was ever built in our country’s history.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Trump’s inaugural address: ‘China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.’ Concluded the 47th president: “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” ‘Going to a battlefield’ The astonishingly gruesome process of constructing the Panama Canal – commenced by America in 1904 and completed a decade later – was undertaken to fulfill the centuries-old dream of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, thereby saving ships from 21-23 extra days at sea by being able to cross through what would become a 51-mile-long waterway. However, “the Panamanian isthmus proved to be one of the most difficult – and deadly – spots in the world in which to construct a channel,” explains History.com: Death could strike in the form of an 18-ton boulder or miniscule, malaria-carrying mosquitoes that bred by the millions in festering swamps and puddles. … “The working condition in those days were so horrible it would stagger your imagination,” recalled laborer Alfred Dottin. “Death was our constant companion. I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily, as if they were just so much lumber.” The most dangerous work took place as laborers carved a ditch 45 feet deep and at least 300 feet wide through an eight-mile mountainous stretch known as the Culebra Cut.” Nicknamed “Hell’s Gorge,” the Culebra Cut was a cauldron of noise with roaring locomotives and belching steam shovels where risks of death ranged from drowning to electrocution. Workers blasted away at the mountains with upwards of 60 million pounds of dynamite, which could ignite prematurely in the tropical Panamanian climate. … Flooding regularly submerged equipment, and the unstable ground could give way at any instant. “The work of months or even years might be blotted out by an avalanche of earth,” lamented a senior U.S. administrator. Particularly for workers partially deafened as a side effect of drinking quinine to ward off malaria, the inability to hear made deadly railroad accidents a regular occurrence. In an oral history, George Hodges remembered a fellow worker who fell trying to hop on a train and the wheel of another train “cut his body right in two…as if he had been chopped with a machete.” As one laborer, Antonio Sanchez, explained, working in “the cut” was just like “going to a battlefield.” Fast-forward six decades. In 1976, Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, campaigning against Gerald Ford, publicly promised – as did Ford – that he would not support transferring the canal from U.S. ownership to Panama, an idea that was then popular with the elites, but not the American people. Yet when he won the presidency, Carter changed his mind and, in 1977, signed the Carter-Torrijos Treaties, transferring total control of the canal to Panama, to take effect on Dec. 31, 1999. Interestingly, during the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan expressed his firm opposition to turning the canal over to Panama … and then defeated Carter in a historic landslide, with a staggering 489 Electoral College votes to Carter’s 49. “When it comes to the [Panama] Canal,” Reagan said, “we built it, we paid for it, it’s ours, and … we are going to keep it!” China’s plans for world domination Today, the big issue cited by Trump and other administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is what has long amounted to the de facto control of the Panama Canal by the nation widely regarded as America’s most dangerous geopolitical adversary. How can that be, many wonder? What happened to the Monroe Doctrine, that revered 200-year-old foreign policy stance established by the fifth U.S. president, James Monroe, holding that any major intervention in the Western Hemisphere – i.e., North, Central or South America – by a foreign power constitutes a potentially hostile act against the U.S.? U.S.-based China expert Gordon Chang – author of several books about China’s barely disguised plans to dominate the world, including his 2024 bestseller, “Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America” – says the Panama Canal has long been a “chokepoint” that Beijing wants to control. And as Secretary of State Marco Rubio told SiriusXM’s Megyn Kelly on Jan. 30: “If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat.” Indeed, as WorldNetDaily reported in February, shortly after Rubio expressed to Panama’s leadership President Trump’s concerns over Chinese influence over the canal, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulina stated that he would not renew a 2017 “memorandum of understanding” by which Panama joined China’s “Belt and Road Initiative.” “Under that program, China funds the construction and development of infrastructure, such as ports, and then takes control of them for its own profit and empire building,” WND reported, adding: “In the case of the canal, [China] has worked on ports at both ends, creating the possibility that it could shut down the canal if it seemed in the best interests of the Chinese Communist Party. It also has been building bridges over the canal, which would offer the same option.” Rubio explained to Panamanian officials that “the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area.” And in Congress, a bill has been introduced directing the U.S. to negotiate the repurchase of the canal from Panama. Meanwhile, Trump’s March 4 prime-time announcement that “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal” referred to BlackRock, the huge U.S.-based investment and asset-management firm. BlackRock purchased the critical ports from CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, officially described as a “Hong Kong-based and Cayman Islands-registered multinational conglomerate corporation” formed in 2015 by a merger of Cheung Kong Holdings and its main associate company Hutchison Whampoa. However, just as with most things concerning Communist China, massive subterfuge and deception are involved. For Hutchinson Whampoa – as a few reality-based media organizations have noted, including this RealClearHistory analysis from January – has been identified as “a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence.” In the report, author Miguel A. Faria succinctly demystifies China’s longtime control of the Panama Canal: The United States built the Panama Canal early in the 20th century with American sweat, toil and money, only to give it away to a leftwing Panamanian dictator via a dubious treaty. The Panamanians, in turn, ceded the Canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence. At about the same time, another Chinese front organization, the Hong Kong-based Hutchinson Port Holdings, obtained a 50-year lease to operate the two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Thus, in case of hostilities, U.S. shipping routes would be cut off and bottled up in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, encircled by the Chinese and their allies Cuba, Venezuela and Panama. To this day, the Chinese deny that they control the Panama Canal, and the American media seem to believe them. President-elect Donald Trump does not. Indeed, the American media have rarely if ever sounded the alarm over this serious threat to U.S. security located right in “America’s backyard” (as Central and South America are commonly referred to in the U.S. global security context). Legacy media stories today instead obsess over Trump’s supposed “expansionist agenda,” his “land grab” obsession and his dangerous vision of “a new U.S. imperialism.” There are a few exceptions, however, including WorldNetDaily, one of the only American media organizations that has sounded the alarm not just recently – but for decades. More than 25 years ago – before the canal was even turned over to the left-wing Panamanian government – WND founder Joseph Farah was passionately making virtually the same arguments Trump has been making during his second term as president. In “Clinton’s Panama Canal admission,” published Dec. 1, 1999, just weeks before Carter’s “gift” of the canal to Panama would take effect (one of many articles Farah wrote during the late ’90s warning about Chinese control of the vital waterway), he focused on then-President Bill Clinton’s public admission that, indeed, China was running the Panama Canal! Was it a Freudian slip? Was it a gaffe? Or was it President Clinton finally being honest about something for the first time in his life? I refer to the statement he made yesterday with regard to the Panama Canal transfer to a group of reporters in the Oval Office before leaving for the West Coast. … Here it is, folks. Hold on to your hats – especially all of you people who scoffed when I began telling you three years ago that the Communist Chinese were taking over the Panama Canal. “I think the Chinese will in fact be bending over backwards to make sure that they run it in a competent and able and fair manner,” Clinton said. That’s verbatim. Those are his words, not mine. Clinton, who has until now denied that the Chinese were to take control of the strategic canal, admitted it publicly. And, as if to underline his admission and seemingly to ensure there could be no misunderstanding of his words, Clinton elaborated. … He compared the operation of the canal to China’s campaign to win admission to the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global trade. “They’ll want to demonstrate to a distant part of the world that they can be a responsible partner,” the president said. “And I would be very surprised if any adverse consequences flowed from the Chinese running the canal.” Oh, absolutely. Responsible. Partner. Competent. Fair. Those are all words I readily associate in my mind with the totalitarian government in Beijing. Don’t you? Well, there you have it, folks. Goodbye Panama Canal. The Bamboo Curtain just moved into the Western Hemisphere – officially, that is. After all, I gave you this history long ago. I told you about the fact that a Chinese government company – a front for the military – Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., was to begin operation of the ports on both ends of the strategic waterway Jan. 1. It has been the Clinton administration and its many apologists in Congress and the press who have laughed, ridiculed the idea. Chinese military shill Alexander Haig suggested I should be jailed for making such accusations. And now the truth has finally come out through an unusually candid admission by Clinton. He is telling us now what has been obvious to anyone familiar with the transfer of the canal. He is admitting what former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Thomas Moorer stated in our pages some time back. Clinton says we can rely on the good intentions of the Chinese to maintain access to the canal. Doesn’t that reassure you? The Chinese, who, as we speak, are rounding up tens of thousands of religious dissidents and interning them, threatening to attack Taiwan and working overtime on developing military technology that could only be used to attack the United States, should be trusted on this Panama Canal deal because it’s a chance for them to show how responsible they really are. This is nuts! When are the American people going to wake up? Clinton is so embarrassed by this deal on the canal that he is not even going to attend the transfer ceremonies. Why? If he doesn’t have any second thoughts and believes giving away the Panama Canal to a hostile foreign power is still a good idea, why not go wave the flag next month at the ceremony? … If ever there was a time – an opportunity – to pressure the politicians to reverse what will someday be judged a historic blunder, it is now. If you really have the guts to stop this thing, America, wake up and take action now. You won’t have to risk your life to write a letter to your senators and representatives in Washington or fill out a simple online petition today. Your kids, however, may someday pay for our mistakes with their blood if you sit silent through this official treachery. The same day, Dec. 1, 1999, this writer published a detailed news article on WND, headlined “In 2000, it’s China Canal,” which included exclusive comments from former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Thomas Moorer, who assured WorldNetDaily that China’s takeover of the canal “would be catastrophic for the U.S.” Editor’s note: In these historic times, stay informed with fearless, hard-hitting, truthful journalism 24/7.

By DIDI TANG, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — In only two decades, China has grown to be the dominant player in shipbuilding, claiming more than half of the world’s commercial shipbuilding market, while the U.S. share has fallen to just 0.1%, posing serious economic and national security challenges for the U.S. and its allies, according to a report released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.In 2024 alone, one Chinese shipbuilder constructed more commercial vessels by tonnage than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II.

Title: Stablecoins Aren’t For Banks—Here’s Why!
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/charleswayn/2025/03/11/stablecoins-arent-for-banks-heres-why/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T15:05:21Z

ByCharles Wayn ByCharles Wayn , Contributor. Golden USDC coins on dark background. 3d iluustration. Recently, we have seen a spate of institutions announce the launch of their own stablecoins, including Societe General, Revolut, and now Bank of America is considering weighing in. One has to question why, though? USDT and USDC - the biggest stablecoins in the industry already account for $200 billion of crypto’s AUM. Accepted widely across most blockchains, centralized and decentralized exchanges, Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT are serving the stablecoin market well. Far less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, they are allowing investors to move easily in and out of crypto and preserve their wealth in countries with hyperinflation. And so, why would a bank like Societe General need to launch its own stablecoin? The answer likely lies in the extremely attractive revenue model that stablecoins operate on. Tether, for example, made a cool $13 billion in profit last year - placing it in the gilded company of Goldman Sachs. This is very impressive and certainly something a large bank would resent. Why pay an upstart third party to settle your transactions when you can do it yourself? Yet, while this may be a perfectly sound business decision, dilution of the stablecoin market would quite literally defeat the object of its existence. Digital assets already suffer from a liquidity issue - with a market cap of around $3trn and the majority of that held in Bitcoin by long-term investors, crypto traders are often hamstrung by this lack. Having two well capitalised, liquid stablecoins is a big bonus in this market and one we should be careful to tinker with. Both USDT and USDC fought hard to win credibility and trust in the industry for many years. They have weathered some of the hardest financial storms while other coins haven’t even scratched the surface compared to the majors. While many stablecoins such as DAI, PYUSD, and Sky Dollar have emerged within the last few years, none have proved themselves at the level these two have. As such, many market participants continue to rely on these two tokens, with their dominance growing even in the face of rising competition. For reference (at the time of writing this), DAI’s market cap is at around 5.3 billion, while PYUSD has a market cap of roughly $741 million. While impressive, this doesn’t even scratch the surface of USDC’s $60 billion and USDT’s huge $142 billion market cap. Despite this, though - and this only goes to serve as a stronger argument as to why banks should stay out of stablecoins – USDT now finds itself in hot water as it is allegedly not complying with the European Union’s new rules on stablecoins. As such it is set to be delisted from major centralized exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and more for European customers. Some might argue that this is a great moment to open the stablecoin market to competition, but if USDT with its decade of experience and billions of dollars of AUM can’t get past the EU, what chance does a much smaller coin have? Granted, those coming out of banks will have an advantage, but they will still face regulatory hurdles that remain a moving target - especially in the US. Of course, in this war of regulation, USDC has been winning for some time. Circle’s laser focus on compliance and backing from institutional behemoths like BlackRock have made it the stablecoin of choice for traditional finance institutions (though crypto natives still view it with caution thanks to its willingness to bow to government sanctions). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, founder Jeremy Allaire holds a similar view on the stablecoin market. In a recent interview in Hong Kong, Allaire stated there really is no need for CBDC’s as the stablecoin market already exists. It is thriving, it is liquid and it is working. Rather, regulators should understand stablecoins and make better rules. Stablecoins must be easily tradable and liquid. This is where having just two majorly traded coins wins. There is no time of the day or night that any trader cannot buy or sell USDT or USDC on any kind of platform (well, for now, at least). If we start to see the market segment into various stablecoins that perhaps larger institutions insist must be used inside their ecosystems, this will impact liquidity, trading, and costs. Charges are likely to increase as without sufficient liquidity the cost of executing transactions tends to rise - as those who battled ETH gas prices in the summer of 2020 remember all too well. This can lead to an expensive, fragmented, and slow investor experience. This should not be the future the stablecoin market or the cryptocurrency industry at large is marching into. Rather than fragmentation we need cohesion and deeper liquidity in order for stablecoins to be treated as a legitimate asset within the financial ecosystem. That said, despite its dominance, USDT faces a fight for its life against new European regulation – Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). This regulation requires stablecoin issuers like Tether to obtain an e-money license to enhance anti-money laundering compliance. However, as mentioned previously, Tether has failed to comply with this regulatory guidance and is not standing down. This will ultimately give USDC the lead, with potentially another challenger entering the ring - at least in Europe. On the other hand, incoming US regulation may take a different view which could mean Europe isn’t such a big deal. Since President Donald Trump’s recent election win, stablecoin market cap has grown by a whopping $40 billion. Regardless of this setback, a plethora of bank-issued stablecoins is not the answer. Banks don’t like paying anybody fees, but – again – as we in the crypto industry know, fees are part of the game to maintain security and ensure smooth blockchain operations. Institutions should get used to that and enjoy liquid markets rather than try to hold onto $25 per transaction, which could create fragmentation and ultimately hinder the mass adoption of stablecoins.

Circuit des Yeux has released "Truth" as the final preview of her forthcoming new album, Halo On the Inside. Speaking of the song, Circuit des Yeux says: “If “Truth” were an object it would be a multi-faced geode that is in constant rotation. Its meaning is continually shifting and lending itself to the way the listener perceives it. The root of its creation comes from a vivid dream I had in 2015 while staying in Blackrock Territory just outside of Dublin, Ireland.” Halo on the Inside will be released on 14 March via Matador.
